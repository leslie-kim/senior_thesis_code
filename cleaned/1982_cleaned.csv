COURTS AND PRISONS: AN EXPANDING ROLE SETS OFF CONTROVERSY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/01/nyregion/courts-and-prisons-an-expanding-role-sets-off-controversy.html,The courts which have always been responsible for deciding who should go to prisons are making more and more decisions about how prisons should be run as well For New York States Commissioner of Correctional Services Thomas A Coughlin 3d such meddling has recently become a major source of consternation Last week he said he would go to prison himself rather than obey a Federal judges order for the speedy transfer of state prisoners being held in New York City jails That decision was hailed by New York City correctional officials who themselves are under court pressure to ease overcrowding in their own system The day after Mr Coughlin made his threat a State Supreme Court justice barred him from using a variety of practices to increase the prison population Mr Coughlin contended that he could not abide by one order without violating the other When asked what this would mean he replied Well I suppose they could keep putting Corrections Commissioners in jail A Divisive Question The issue of how much courts should intervene in the management of government agencies has in recent years become one of the most divisive questions for both politicians and judges It has arisen largely because many groups seeking social change have often found that their pleas receive a far more favorable hearing from the courts than from legislatures The most notable ruling which spurred more than a quartercentury of social litigation was the United States Supreme Court decision in 1954 declaring segregated schools unconstitutional Since then the courts have been asked to make controversial judgments on issues such as school busing the rights of the mentally ill and abortion Generally critics of judicial intervention say that those who go to court are seeking to frustrate the publics will But in the case of prisons advocates of change say they have a particular justification for seeking judicial remedies since the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution specifically forbids cruel and unusual punishments Because the treatment of prisoners they argue is a matter with constitutional dimensions  like free speech or freedom of religion  prison policy cannot be left entirely to the electorate The court s havent said you cant confine prisoners said Robert Gangi who will take over next year as executive director of the Correctio nal Association of New York They have said you must not confine prisoners in a way that violates the Constitut ion Ruling on Early Parole The most dramatic recent instance of a court intervening on prison issues came in midDecember when a Federal judge ordered that 350 Alabama state prisoners be given early parole because the state had failed to reduce prison overcrowding Though few involved in the corrections issue in New York expect such a decision here any time soon the states problems with overcrowding are severe fostered in part by the public clamor for tougher sentencing of convicted criminals The states prisons are at 112 percent of capacity and local jail populations are also swollen Even correctional officials who complain loudly about what they see as court interference in their work acknowledge that judicial pressure is often essential to changing prison conditions This is so they say because building adequate prisons is hardly the most popular cause for politicians to espouse Do you think for a minute that given a choice between fixing the Williamsburg Bridge or building a jail Ed Koch would have chosen to build a jail unless he were forced to do it asked one correctional official referring to the citys plan to construct new prison facilities in response to court orders And Edward Hershey the citys assistant correction commissioner for public affairs noted that the defeat of the 500 million state prison bond issue by the voters last November was a sign of voters reluctance to act on prison issues without outside prodding A Call for More Leeway Commissioner Coughlin acknowledges that massive social change often requires court decisions Youre not going to change these things through the normal political process he said The problem is when the courts get caught up in the minutiae Youre drawing the courts into the morass of daytoday operational decisions Mr Coughlin argues that court decisions on complex social issues should allow administrators more leeway on the specifics His favorite examples these days of what he considers excessive specificity are recent rulings by Judge Morris E Lasker of Federal District Court in Manhattan including the one with which the Commissioner said he could not comply Judge Lasker ruled last week that state prisoners must be moved from city prisons within 48 hours Why 48 hours Mr Coughlin asked Why not 72 hours Or 96 A Disputed Limit The judge also limited the population of the House of Detention for Men on Rikers Island to 1200 Why not 1350 the Commissioner asked Mr Coughlins critics say his attacks on the courts are designed to put pressure on the Legislature to appropriate more money for prisons And Mr Gangi of the Correctional Association argues that the decisions by the Federal and state judges are not at all contradictory Both are designed to ease overcrowding and both he contends could be complied with if the state were sufficiently innovative For all his attacks on the courts Mr Coughlin as well as Governor Carey have used them to their own ends While campaigning for the prison bond issue Mr Carey warned that if the proposal failed the courts would soon be telling the state how to run its correctional facilities It was one gubernatorial prediction that seems to be coming true

CHINA'S POLICY ON BIRTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/opinion/chinas-policy-on-births.html,Pekings rigid plan to control population growth conflicts sharply with the liberal economic policies it is pursuing in the countryside where family planning has met renewed resistance from 800 million peasants now armed with greater economic rights The growth of Chinas huge population  last year officially estimated at 98255 million  must be limited if the the countrys modernization strategy is to succeed Hoping to quadruple the gross national product per capita to 1000 by the end of the century Peking in 197 9 announced a new plan to prevent the population from growing large r than 12 billion The ultimate goal is to reduce the population to 650 million to 700 million in the year 2080 The previous limit of twochildren per family has been replaced by a drastic one couple one child policy designed to restrict the families of the 160 million young people who will reach marriageable age between 1980 and 1985 Chinas centralized political and economic system has helped execute the new plan Rewards and punitive economic measures  affecting grain allocation housing medical care schooling and employment  have been established to deter couples from producing excess children About 10 million couples are complying with the program However most live in cities where the Government maintains strong economic and administrative control An article in The Peoples Daily laments At present it is quite easy to implement the one couple one child policy in the cities But it is very difficult to do so in the countryside due to the economic interests and backward ideology of the peasantry But it is in the countryside where the policy will win or fail Agricultural reforms have given Chinas 135 million peasant households greater economic power with which to defy harsh birthcontrol programs The highly collectivized and egalitarian commune system  which in the past helped to enforce Pekings population policy  is giving way to a new system of production responsibility which encourages private farming and greatly reduces commune leaders authority The expansion of private plots of land and the new policy of assigning output quotas to individual peasants or households have tremendously boosted the peasants enthusiasm and productivity But the new official policy also allows some peasant households to get rich ahead of others  and households with more laborers will have a significant advantage We now work on our own We dont ask for grain money or cloth from the Government If we produce some more children thats our own problem and nobody can interfere said a peasant in Sichuan Province where the birth rate has risen considerably in the last two years The national familyplanning office denounces local leaders reluctance to tackle planned parenthood work for fear of antagonizing the masses and losing votes In Kiangsi Province couples who produce a child not provided for in the Governments plan are fined 1000 yuan 571 Between playing with my baby and playing with 1000 yuan Id prefer my baby says a young mother of two Besides the additional labor power will surely mean more than 1000 yuan in the long run Chinas Ministry of Justice recently denounced as illegal and criminal operations to remove internally worn loops  the most common birthcontrol device in rural areas Such operations are reportedly rising as more peasant women wish to conceive again Peking is aware of rural peoples opposition to its population policy and has undertaken measures to weaken peasants resistance Insome areas for example the Government is al loting smaller private plots and grain fields to recalcitrant househ olds Pekings Guangming Daily has also aired an open call for familyplanning legislation  a move that would make birth control compulsory for all including the countrys national minorities hitherto exempt from family planning In the meantime a system of rewards and punishments is being brought to bear on the rural bureaucracy Not too long ago a prefecture in Kwangtung Province counted about 100000 pregnant women who would be having their second or third babies Then during May and June hundreds of local leaders began hunting around the countryside for pregnant women and the figure suddenly dropped to 47000 Even women nine months pregnant were forced to undergo abortions The local bureaucrats apparently are determined to get rewards not reprimand or punishment from the Peking familyplanning office Theres no mistaking Pekings determination to limit population growth But as its economic reforms continue to encourage peasant families to produce more children the issue of population control will remain a source of painful conflict between the Chinese peasantry and the Communist state
BILL MOYERS- 'THE TRICK IS TO MAKE TV WORK FOR YOU',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/arts/bill-moyers-the-trick-is-to-make-tv-work-for-you.html,In the six weeks since he moved  for the second time in his career  from public television to CBS News Bill Moyers has delivered a dozen commentaries for the morning and evening news on subjects ranging from the situation in Poland to Christmas books completed an hourlong documentary on Vietnam veterans and begun another about the underclass in the Reagan era reported a fiveandahalfminute story for the evening news about political maneuvering on an Alaskan pipeline bill which inspired several hundred letters of praise and interviewed Saul Bellow for a lengthy profile that appeared on CBSs Sunday Morning In his spare moments he has found time to promote one of the most intellectually ambitious television projects in many years a 17part series titled Creativity With Bill Moyers that begins this Friday on public television WNETChannel 13 at 900 PM with a profile of the poet Maya Angelou It is not the sheer volume of Mr Moyerss work that makes him so unusual but the broadranging role he has carved out for himself He has been by turns student teacher reporter and preacher In a medium more effective at communicating images and impressions than ideas and insights Mr Moyers has emerged as the one broadcast journalist who consistently wrestles with ideas in areas such as history literature philosophy and politics On the one hand Mr Moyers has inherited the mantle of Eric Sevareid at CBS and he is now the only broadcaster at any of the three networks doing regular commentary for the evening news At the same time he has established himself as a crusading reporter in the tradition of Edward R Murrow During his first brief tenure at CBS  from 1976 to 1978  he served as correspondent for awardwinning documentaries such as The CIAs Secret Army and The Fire Next Door about arson and crime in the South Bronx But Mr Moyers has made his most distinctive mark with the extended interviews and reported essays he did on public television during most of the past ten years While there are print journalists who range j ust as widely Mr Moyers is one of th e rare broadcasters whose stature earned him the freedom to pursu e his varied interests and to command the air time to explore them i n detail It is not yet clear whether he will have similar freedom at CBS but on Bill Moyers Journal he offered essays about sub jects as disparate as Watergate and the crisis in Iran interviewed politicians ranging from Secretary of State Alexander Haig to Cal ifornias Gov Jerry Brown and conducted long conversations with leading men and women ofletters such as philosopher Mortimer Adler c ritic George Steiner historian William Irwin Th ompson poet Robert Penn Warren and novelist Rebecca West The Creativity series is a logical extension of those conversations Through subjects like Miss Angelou violinist Pinchas Zukerman a group of inventors and students at the High School for the Performing Arts Mr Moyers tries to explore the varied origins and expressions of the creative process The programs are meant to be informative and entertaining but there is also a populist message laced through them Mr Moyers argues that creativity is not merely Godgiven but can be nurtured The individuals profiled in the series he says in his introductory remarks are extraordinary but not so extraordinary we cannot see ourselves in them But just how well suited is Mr Moyers style of inquiry to television It is notable for instance that with exceptions such as Dick Cavett and Charles Kuralt virtually no one else in television is even working the same territory And to what extent does Mr Moyers consign himself to a certain frustration when he chooses to sacrifice televisions most powerful asset  the drama of visual action in order to explore issues that even he acknowledges can be treated more substantively in print To Mr Moyers the challenge of television public or commercial is to use the mediums visual and dramatic strengths to make ideas more accessible Television is wholly different than print he says The printed page conveys information and commitment and requires active involvement Television conveys emotion and experience and its very limited in what it can do logically Its an existential experience  there and then gone A producer is a saboteur who tries to infiltrate the passivity of viewers and to create impressions that are lasting Ironically however none of the profiles in the Creativity series provide as thoughtful or detailed a summation of Mr Moyerss findings as his writing about the subject including an article he did for the Smithsonian magazine and a paper he prepared for a planning session on the series In each of the televised profiles Mr Moyers eschews explanation choosing instead to let the subjects speak for themselves and wherever possible to have the camera record them in the act of creation Indeed as an interviewer Mr Moyers is better at drawing out his subjects and synthesizing their ideas than he is at fashioning original insights In the profile of Miss Angelou that launches the Creativity series for example he remains mostly in the background Yet it is clear when Miss Angelou speaks so movingly about growing up black in Stamps Ark  I was terribly hurt and vastly loved in this town she says that the intimacy of her musings grows out of a sense of ease with Mr Moyers and a respect for the nature of his inquiry Faced with a less articulate subject in a subsequent profile  Fred Smith the founder of Federal Express the overnight package delivery service  Mr Moyers offers few of his own conclusions about the nature of entrepreneurial creativity when Mr Smith himself cannot The two profiles are also unintended evidence of televisions power and its limitations When Miss Angelou is seen wandering through her hometown the visual drama speaks for itself In the portrait of Mr Smith there are no arresting images to help tell the story and its impact is that much less compelling In moving from public television to CBS for a second time Mr Moyers faces another concern Then as now he was lured to the network because it offered broader reach and better newsgathering resources than public television But the risk is that in a commercial environment he will sacrifce the freedom to do the sort of serious programs that command smaller audiences In his first stint at CBS he was the correspondent on 17 hourlong documentaries but decided to leave anyway when he was unable to get a regular primetime slot for the extended essays and conversations that are his primary interest It is no still hard to imagine a commercial network devoting prime time to a halfhour conversation with Mortimer Adler  a program that generated 12000 requests for transcripts when Mr Moyers did it on his Journal  or to a series on the creative process Nonetheless Mr Moyers has returned to CBS partly because public televisions financial problems made his situation increasingly untenable there and partly because he is hopeful that the growing audience interest in news and information will make viable the forum that eluded him in his earlier tenure at CBS If Mr Moyers brings a sense of mission to his work on television it is much the same impulse that drew him ea rly in his life to the church where he studied to become a Baptist minister in his 20s and then to politics where he served as a to p aide to Lyndon Johnson during his Presidency and later as de puty director of the Peace Corps I never thought of being creative when I was growing up Mr Moyers says What was drilled into me was to be a minister in the secular sense  although for a while I took it literally My goal was to do good th ings or to help others do good things I see myself as an entreprene ur of ideas not an intellectual Television is a whole new universe It gives you a dialogue with Dubuque and Sacramento Raoul Burger the Harvard law professor once said to me Bill I think you hav e the biggest classroom of any teacher I know  At the same time television provides Mr Moyers an arena in which to serve more personal needs I own and operate a ferocious ego he acknowledges and through television he has gained not only a national forum but a considerable measure of celebrity By approaching his work as a form of public service he can enjoy both  the wide exposure and the applause  in good conscience He is quick to enumerate the people in high places and the everyday viewers who have written in praise of his Journal  but always in the context of being useful of having an impact One of the first programs Mr Moyers did on public television was about a campaign by citizens in Mouth of Wilson Va to save a local river When the effort proved successful in part because of the publicity his show generated Mr Moyers felt he had found his calling All roads led me to television Mr Moyers says It was a place where I could write act be engaged in the world of ideas and where I could draw on my background in government news and even theology To Mr Moyers his greatest strength has always been as a collaborator and a catalyst In 1964 he says Lyndon Johnson asked me to coordinate 14 task forces to put together the Great Society legislation I wasnt as smart as a lot of the people in the group but I was able to meld a group of academics bureaucrats and pragmatists and help translate their ideas into action Mr Moyers balances conflicting motivations in his work His belief in public service compels him to take stands on those issues he considers important But he also evidences a deep desire to be appreciated to avoid alienating even those with whom he disagrees He takes great pride for example in the fact that his Journal has been praised by critics from across the ideological spectrum including the right wing watchdog organization Christian Alert That group last year named Mr Moyerss Journal as the only show on television to which it had no objections  despite the fact that Mr Moyers had been critical of rightwing evangelists on one segment of Journal and has regularly taken positions abhorrent to the right such as favoring the right of women to choose abortion In this appeal to disparate constituencies Mr Moyers has proved himself deft both as a performer and a politician With his downhome accent his fresh scrubbed looks and his generally reasoned presentation of all sides in a controversy he radiates fairness even when he quietly offers his views at the end of an essay But Mr Moyerss understated approach can have its drawbacks His programs sometimes lack the hard edge and intensity that come from passionate partisanship He asks intelligent questions but he is rarely combative In part that may be because Mr Moyers is himself an insider a man for whom the system has worked the son of a dirt farmer who worked his way up and acquired establishment credentials that are quite formidable In addition to his role in government during the 1960s he has served on corporate boards and he remains a member of the establishmentdominated Council on Foreign Relations In his own community of Garden City LI he is an active member of the church Im satisfied with the niche Ive carved out Mr Moyers says I have a body of work Im proud of and people who appreciate it In politics you build a consensus through the melding of constituencies and I think I did that with the Journal too Viewers may not have liked every show but over the course of a season each of them find something and that gives you an accumulated constituency The only way I can explain the appeal of the Journal is that people are turned on by ideas and by learning Its only when the presentation is dry antiseptic and impersonal that theyre turned off The trick is to make the medium work for you and thats what Ive got to do now at CBS Ideas do count but not if theyre reduced to being told in a minuteforty five
Coast Senator Defends Anti-Semitic Remarks,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/us/coast-senator-defends-anti-semitic-remarks.html,State Senator John Schmitz who is runni ng for the Republican nomination for the United States Senateseat now held by SI Hayakawa says he does not regret antiSemitic remarks about abortion supporters that prompt ed his colleagues to strip him of three Senate jobs Mr Schmitz the Presidential nominee of the American Independent Party in 1972 said Tuesday that his critics were Jewishdominated and that William Campbell the Senate Republican leader who endorsed the move to strip him of his posts was only a front for a Jewish aide The Democratic majority of the Senate Rules Committee on Monday stripped Mr Schmitz of his chairmanship of the Senate Constitutional Amendment Committee the vice chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Industrial Relations and his position as Senate delegate to the state Commission on the Status of Women The Rules Committee acted after Senator Schmitz issued a statement on Constitutional Amendments Committee stationery in which he described hearings he chaired on a proposed amendment to the California Constitution to ban abortions He said in the release that at a hearing in Los Angeles he looked out on a sea of hard Jewish and arguably female faces and called opponents of the amendment murderous marauders
NEW CHARITY COALITIONS CHALLENGING LONGTIME DOMINANCE OF UNITED WAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/nyregion/new-charity-coalitions-challenging-longtime-dominance-of-united-way.html,In a challenge to the United Way of TriState which for years has maintained nearly exclusive access to companies in the metropolitan area new coalitions of charities are beginning to solicit donations in the work place This new competition which has come in reaction to Federal cutbacks and the Reagan Administrations efforts to pass along to the private sector greater responsibility for social programs is being viewed as a threat by officials of the local United Way Over the years it has provided funds for hundreds of charitable agencies in New York City and nearby areas of upstate New York New Jersey and Connecticut The competition for charitable contributions has probably never been as keen as it is today said John F McGillicuddy chairman of the board and president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and head of the 19 8182 TriState drive In a pamphlet to potential contributors he says Corporations are being inundated with requests for donations because of Federal cutbacks Organizations that had relied on Government grants are now making direct appeals What we have is a whole new ball game  not just another campaign The nascent coalitions principally the New York Black United Fund and the Womens Funding Coalition are made up of newer charities that do not meet the specifications for membership in United Way or have been turned down for other reasons These charities are generally considered more narrowly focused on service to women minority groups and the poor than are the established charity organizations supported by United Way Automatic Payroll Deductions These coalitions would like greater access to the work place where United Way wields a powerful fundraising tool  the automatic payroll deduction Under this arrangement employees can have pledges taken out of their paychecks each week and forwarded to United Way Some employees of large companies have recently complained of feeling pressured by their superiors to agree to these payroll deductions United Way of TriState a branch of the largest charity in the nation has been struggling to maintain the level of funds it gives to member agencies after two years of stagnating contributions that have not kept pace with inflation The United Way of TriState is now nearing the close of its 198182 campaign which ends in March United Way itself does not provide any recreational or charitable services Instead it serves as a collection agency and disburses funds to such groups as the Red Cross the Salvation Army Catholic Charities the Young Mens Christian Association and the New York Urban League to name a few of the larger recipients In turn these charities agree not to solicit in the work place where United Way serves as their sole agent Other wellknown charities such as the American Cancer Society the American Heart Association and the Boy Scouts of America have not joined the United Way in New York City because they feel that they can raise more money on their own In addition they are unwilling to give up the opportunity to solicit on their own in offices Reexamination of Methods If the United Way would give us enough money we would join tomorrow said Lewis Weisblatt director of development for the New York City affiliate of the American Heart Association The competition fostered by the newer groups is spurring the Greater New York FundUnited Way the distribution arm in New York City to reexamine the way it allocates its funds It is looking for ways to give more money to charities that specifically help the disadvantaged At present the Greater New York Fund allocates 175 million of its 225 million annual budget for special grants to other mostly nonmember organizations that are essentially serving the disadvantaged population in the city according to the funds director Joseph Weber That amount has been frozen at 175 million for the past three years Mr Weber said that at its next meeting the funds board of directors would consider enlarging this special allocations program as well as changing the set percentage formulas by which its 375 member charities receive money The Nationa l Committee for Responsive Philanthropy a private group has cr iticized United Way for not supporting more new charities as fullfledged members New and Emerging Needs Theres a real value in supporting new charities that are closer to new and emerging needs said Tim Saasta the committees assistant director They try to be the consensus charity and try to be everything to all people so they can raise more and more money The problem is you end up being rather benign and end up not having the kind of impact in the community that you could have and should have The Greater New York Fund has embraced a number of new and more experimental charities through its limited special allocations program Among these are the Fort Apache Youth Center Inc the United Haitian Association of the USA and the Institute for the Puerto RicanHispanic Elderly The largest special grant for 1981 78375 went to the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors The list of special allocations recipients reflects a slight shift in policy for the fund in that it includes a number of groups that concentrate on referrals and advocacy rather than strictly providing services according to Arthur H Barnes president of the New York Urban Coalition and a member of United Ways committee on special allocations They have made a concrete atte mpt to broaden their outreach said Mr Barnes He said the special allocations program had grown to its present budget three years ago after a group called the Black Agency Executives met with the Greater New York Funds administrators The black executives pointed out said Mr Barnes that the human service needs were not being met by the United Fund and that nonmember agencies were in dire need of support Wed Better Do Something Mr Barnes said the latest competition from the New York Black United Fund would serve as an impetus for that exploration to continue He said the competing initiatives had made officials of the Greater New York Fund feel that wed better do something and do something substantial One of the more controversial organizations that the Greater New York Fund does not finance is Planned Parenthood of New York which last attempted to join the United Way in the early 1970s The admission of Planned Parenthood was opposed then and is still opposed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York The archdiocese objects to Planned Parenthoods promotion of abortion rights and to the fact that it provides abortion services According to Alfred F Moran executive director of New York Planned Parenthood the United Way told his organization not to apply for membership because we were too controversial The Rev Edward OBrien a spokesman for the New York Archdiocese said in an interview that the archdiocese would withdraw from the United Way if Planned Parenthood were to become a member Furthermore he said the archdiocese would discourage Catholics from giving to the United Way Criteria Not Met Some charities cannot meet United Ways criteria for financing because of the way they are organized The fund believes that it has a duty to be accountable to donors by financing only charities with an acceptable management structure A case in point is the Womens Counseling Project a Manhattan group that provides crisis counseling and refers women to health career legal and social service programs The project which has a 30000 budget applied last summer for help from the Greater New York Funds special allocations program We were told we were too small and too unstructured for them to fund and we should have a fulltime executive director said Sonia Levin a member of the projects board of directors We would have to increase our budget but our staff is too busy with direct services to spend time on fundraising Weve been around 10 years We felt that shows a stability They were very helpful but we couldnt fit into their framework We think were very effective as a small agency Instead the counseling project has become one of 15 charter members of the Womens Funding Coalition which announced its formation at a news conference just two and a half weeks ago Dues Checkoff Sought One of the main new competitors for United Way is the National Black United Fund which formed a New York branch about a year ago Dissatisfied with the number of blackrun groups that were receiving money from the Greater New York Fund it has pr essed for the payroll checkoff priv ilege in a number of corporations and has met with some success Recently Bell Laboratories in New Jersey agreed to allow its employees to pledge payroll deductions to the National Black United Fund and the New York Black United Fund will be allowed to solicit employees at the International Business Machines Corporation in Westchester County The New York City Housing Authority has also told the New York Black United Fund that it will allow payroll checkoffs next year Last June the Federal Government decided to allow 20 additional national charities including the National Black United Fund and the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund to solicit contributions from its employees United Way is the brainchild of corporate America said Kermit Eady director of the New York Black United Fund The board is made up of corporate executives They view Black United Funds as competition to the United Way Sophisticated Technique Indeed Calvin E Green the new president of United Way of TriState says multiple payroll checkoffs would dilute the United Way campaign and work counter to the original purpose of this kind of consolidated appeal  to simplify office giving and save company time spent accommodating solicitors for different charities Over the years United Way has developed a sophisticated office technique It relies on volunteers within the companies to organize the appeal and make personal solicitations t hus saving considerable administrative costs United Way provides companies with a graduated chart that suggests what is a fair share contribution by an employee based on gross annual income For example people earning 20000 are asked to contribute 180 or 09 percent of their income Employees earning 40000 are asked for 640 or 16 percent of income as their fair share Employees earning 75000 are asked for 1875 or 25 percent of income This is a guideline for people so they can evaluate their giving in relationship to what others in a similar income bracket are contributing said Mr Green the TriState president People want to know what others are giving Approach is Assailed Mr Green emphasized however that the decision to use the fairshare chart lies with each company and that giving is a very personal thing  no one can tell anyone what to give Nonetheless some employees of large companies have complained that the fairshare technique constitutes coercion The Koch administration has used that word to explain in part why the city does not now allow United Way a checkoff privilege with city employees paychecks The city also is in a quandary over how to choose among the many charitable organizations that have asked to use payroll deduction Two lowlevel management employees at the New York Telephone Company recently complained to The New York Times that their superiors had used pressure tactics after the employees had given less than what senior management had recommended as their fair contribution to United Way of TriState Frank McCarthy general chairman of the companys 1981 United Way campaign said The policy of the company is to make the pitch as good and as effective as you can It is not company policy to pressure or embarrass anybody However Fran Shelton and Charleene Woods two supervisors who work in the companys QueensBronx Business Service Center in Jamaica Queens felt otherwise The women said they had been called separately to

No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/06/garden/no-headline-161949.html,THE prenatal period is the most vulnerable time of a childs life Though it was once thought that the fetus was well protected from external harm in recent decades hundreds of substances organisms and circumstances have been shown to have a malignant effect on fetal development and survival Despite widespread publicity about the fetal harm done by such things as thalidomide rubella infection cigarette smoking and alcohol many pregnant women continue to expose their unborn children to needless hazards It is now known that fetal vulnerability changes during the course of pregnancy a substance harmless during the early months may become harmful later on or vice versa Furthermore questions have been raised about the prenatal hazards of sexual intercourse previously thought to be safe About 20 percent of birth defects are caused by environmental factors such as drugs viruses and vitamin deficiencies and excesses Sixty percent more result from the interaction of some environmental factor and a genetic predisposition An unknown but presumably large proportion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths are also attributable to the harmful effects of prenatal exposure to some noxious agent or condition Thus it is important for every woman  whether already pregnant or contemplating pregnancy  to know the potential hazards and how to protect against them The single most important form of protection is to go to a good doctor preferably an obstetrician or maternity clinic as soon as pregnancy is suspected Early prenatal care and continued care throughout pregnancy reduce the risk of stillbirth and death of the newborn by 75 p ercent It is also important to eat a wellb alanced diet gaining onaverage of 25 pounds in the course of pregnan cy somewhat less if oneis obese to start with and more if very thin  Continuation of prepregnancy exercise habits including jogging is not known to have any harmful effect on the fetus or the woman However pregnant women are cautioned against deep scuba diving and prolonged sauna bathing since both may harm the fetus Other factors to consider include the following Drugs The tragic harm caused by the sleeping potion thalidomide when administered during pregnancy apparently has had little effect on the drugtaking habits of most pregnant women A study in 1973 showed that 82 percent of women had taken prescription drugs during their pregnancy with an average of four drugs prescribed per woman A study five years later that included overthecounter medications showed that all the women had taken two or more drugs with the average exposure being 11 drugs per woman Virtually all drugs can cross the placenta and reach the fetus Eighty percent of drugs currently on the market have never been tested for safety during pregnancy The list of drugs known to be potentially harmful to the fetus includes aspirin near the end of pregnancy acetaminophen is a safer choice the antibiotics tetracycline streptomycin and sulfa drugs penicillin ampicillin and cephalosporins are safer antithyroid drugs the antiinflammatory drugs indomethacin and naproxen the anticonvulsant Dilantin the anticoagulant warfarin the highbloodpressure drugs thiazide and reserpine iodine including that used in vaginal douches excessive amounts of the essential nutrients vitamins C D and K calcium and copper sex hormones including oral contraceptives and the tranquilizer Librium The rule of thumb during pregnancy is to take no medication  not even an antacid an antiemetic or a laxative unless it is essential to your health and prescribed for you by a physician who knows you are or might be pregnant Alcohol Women who drink heavily during pregnancy face a high risk of bearing a child with a spectrum of defects including abnormal facial features heart defects growth retardation and mental and motor deficiencies It is now known that more moderate drinking is also harmful Women who drink one to two ounces of pure alcohol the equivalent of two to four cocktails beers or glasses of wine a day have nearly a 10 percent risk of bearing a child with some features of the syndrome and those who drink this amount twice a week face an increased risk of spontaneous abortion A single drink toward the end of pregnancy can temporarily suspend fetal breathing motions 9 Since it is not yet known what if any amount of alcohol might be safe experts now recommend that pregnant women keep their drinking to a bare min imum or abstain completely Caffeine Miscellaneous reports of increased rates of spontaneous abortion and birth defects among coffee drinkers and a variety of animal tests have prompted the Federal Food and Drug Administration to recommend that women stop or reduce their consumption of coffee tea and other caffeinecontaining products during pregnancy Tobacco Cigarette smoking during pregnancy interferes with the blood and oxygen supply to an unborn child resulting in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion stillbirth prematurity reduced birth weight pregnancy complications death of the newborn crib death cleft lip and cleft palate strabismus an eye that turns in or out and hernias as well as longterm adverse effects on growth and development Children of smoking mothers score lower on tests of neurological psychological and intellectual ability and are more likely to be irritable and hyperactive Infections The list of infections that can harm the fetus includes rubella once called German measles regular measles mumps herpes simplex virus syphilis gonorrhea viral hepatitis in the second half of pregnancy cytomegalovirus toxoplasmosis and influenza With few exceptions a woman should not be immunized with live virus vaccines during pregnancy Flu vaccine is recommended only for pregnant women with serious underlying diseases Travel to foreign countries where shots are required against such infections as yellow fever cholera typhoid and so on is not recommended To protect against toxoplasmosis spread through raw meat and cat feces pregnant women are urged to eat only thoroughly cooked meats wash hands after handling raw meat and avoid handling cat litter boxes and anything that may be contaminated with cat feces An experimental vaccine is under study against cytomegalovirus which can impair brain development even if the newborn has no obvious symptoms of infection A recent study of nearly 27000 pregnancies revealed a link between potentially harmful infections of th e amniotic fluid in which the fetus floats and sexual intercours e in the month before delivery These infections can result in stil lbirth and neonatal death Aside from abstinence during pregnancy  a possible preventive might be use of a condom and careful cleansin g of the genital area ofboth partners prior to intercourse Radiation Though prenatal exposure to Xrays in dosages up to 10 rads well above the amount used in ordinary diagnostic Xrays apparently does not cause birth defects higher doses can and there is conflicting evidence that the risk of childhood leukemia may be increased at far lower dosages Several protective measures are recommended Nonemergency Xray examinations of a womans abdominal and pelvic area should be postponed until after pregnancy in the nonpregnant woman nonemergency Xrays are best done within 10 days of her last menstrual period when feasible ultrasound which involves no radiation and has no known harmful fetal effects should be used instead of Xrays during pregnancy during all nonabdominal Xrays the womans abdominal and pelvic area should be protected with a lead apron all nondental Xray examinations should be done by a fully qualified radiologist and a woman should complete Xray examinations of her teeth and gums prior to becoming pregnant An abortion is not justified by the risks to the fetus of ordinary radiation exposure Nor is it wise for a pregnant woman to refuse an essential Xray examination
Political Snipers and a Good Judge,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/opinion/political-snipers-and-a-good-judge.html,Until early November Judith Whittaker a Kansas City lawyer was the Justice Departments leading candidate for a seat on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals The American Bar Association found her well qualified The FBI had no objections And Chief Judge Donald Lay was delighted that after nearly two years Washington was finally ready to appoint a judge whom he considered an excellent choice But the nomination never happened At the last minute the White House decided to look for someone else Why Not for lack of legal ability Mrs Whittaker 43 years old graduated first in her class at the University of Missouri Law School after qualifying for law review at the University of Michigan The problem lay in her failure to pass muster with a handful of ultraconservative Missouri snipers A quick and dirty letterwriting campaign tagged her with every farright heresy from being a closet Democrat to being against business for abortion and for the Equal Rights Amendment In fact her record makes Mrs Whittaker look like a nearly perfect choice for an Administration that seeks a conservative judge She i s a Republican Her opinion on abortion is not publicly know n She has worked for business for the last nine years and is now ass ociate general counsel for Hallmark Cards She would also seem ideal from another perspective the Reagan Administration despite its pledge to seek out female judges has not done so  with the obvious exception of appointing Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court Eight men but no women have been appointed to appeals courts 31 men and one woman to district courts Yet now the Administration says no to Mrs Whittaker Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults who should know better explains the shift by saying she lacks broadbased support Her narrowbased opposition is apparently more impressive The same supposed defect is noted in the Senate which must confirm judicial nominees Michael Hammon counsel to the Republican Steering Committee reports that senators are getting substantial numbers of letters against her There is no organized basis of support for her he explains Campaigns are fine for elective office but when it comes to the Federal judiciary the very idea is repugnant Political considerations cannot be wholly eliminated but the selection of Federal judges ought to be the paradigm of the merit system To turn these priorities around debases the judiciary  and the Reagan Administration
U.S. DROPS RULE ON TAX PENALTY FOR RACIAL BIAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/09/us/us-drops-rule-on-tax-penalty-for-racial-bias.html,The Reagan Administration reversing an 11yearold Federal policy announced today that it would no longer deny taxexempt status to private schools colleges and certain other nonprofit institutions that practice racial discrimination The decision on the interpretation of the tax laws will apparently entitle more than 100 schools and other organizations whose tax exemptions were revoked in the last decade to receive favorable tax treatment as charitable organizations It is also expected to open the door to tax exemptions for many other private segregated schools that have never had them Justice and Treasury Department officials said that the reason for the policy change was that policies against racial discrimination should be enforced by Congress not the tax authorities Reversal Since September Allowing tax exemptions to racially discriminatory institutions is the opposite of the legal position the Justice Department took in the Supreme Court last September in a case involving a university and a school that had been denied tax exem ptions fo r racially discriminatory admissions policies The department argued then that the Federal tax laws required the Government to deny tax exemptions to racially discriminatory organizations Today the Justice Department notified the Supreme Court that the Treasury Department had moved to reinstate the taxexempt status of one of the two institutions in the case Bob Jones University in Greenville SC whose exemption was revoked in 1970 and to grant the taxexempt status that had been denied to the other Goldsboro Christian Schools in Goldsboro NC which denies admission to blacks Religious Grounds Cited Bob Jones University used to deny admission to all blacks and now bans interracial dating or marriage among its students some of whom are black Both of these fundamentalist Christian schools tie their racially restrictive policies to religious beliefs Civil liberties lawyers who had supported the Governments previous policy said today that they were appalled by the Administrations decision to reverse it and to allow what some called an indirect subsidy for racial discrimination But representatives of the two schools that had battled the Government to the Supreme Court expressed delight at its lastminute capitulation to their point of view Because of its change in policy the Justice Department asked the Court to vacate as moot the appeals by the two institutions of decisions in Federal appeals court upholding the previous Treasury Department denials The Supreme Court agreed in October to decide the appeals The department said it had concluded contrary to its position in the summer that the practice of denying tax exemptions to charitable and educational institutions that practiced racial discrimination or violated other fundamental public policies was forbidden by Federal tax laws The Federal policy change to be embodied in revocation of Internal Revenue Service rulings was decided upon by Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan approved by Attorney General William French Smith and acquiesced in after the fact by the Wh ite House accord ing to a Treasury Department official The policy was announced in a press release quoting Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard McNamar who said that the Internal Revenue Code did not explicitly authorize denial of tax deducations for racial discrimination except in the case of social clubs He explained We are attempting to protect the independence of all private taxexempt organizations  many of which may follow practices and adhere to principles with which we disagree But before the Government gets into the business of deciding which organizations are worthy of tax exemption and which are not we want Congress to fully consider the implications of such a course Provisions of Tax Code Section 501c3 of the Internal Revenue Code and related provisions entitle qualifying charitable educational religious and scientific organizations to exemption from Federal income Social Security and unemployment taxes and entitle people who contribute to such organizations to take charitable deductions Since 1970 the Government has based its denial of taxexempt status to institutions practicing racial discrimination upon legislative history and an interpretation of the word charitable in the law as excluding organizations that violate fundamental public policies Today Justice Department officials said they viewed the legislative history as meaning precisely the opposite of what it had been viewed to mean by the Nixon Ford and Carter Administrations In a background briefing another Treasury official said that the decision to grant tax exemptions to Bob Jones and Goldsboro had been difficult because both of them openly proclaim their refusal for religious reasons to admit blacks He termed their racial policies abhorrent to this Administration But he said that the policy of having the Internal Revenue Service police the racial practices of private organizations could divert the service from the task of raising revenues to the task of enforcing other national policies And the official added that the broad discretion that the Government has assumed since 1970 to deny tax exemptions on grounds of public policy could if left intact be abused under another Administration He cited as examples the possibility of denying tax exemptions to womens colleges on the ground of sex discrimination or to hospitals that have a policy on abortion inconsistent with the preferences of the Administration in power President Reagan said soon after he took office that  the taxing power of the Government must not be used to r egulate the economy or bring about social changes

RENOVATED LIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/books/renovated-lives.html,A MOTHER AND TWO DAUGHTERS By Gail Godwin 564 pp New York The Viking Press 1595 IT was Emerson who called for men and women who shall renovate life and our social state believing that our arts our occupations our marriages our religion we have not chosen but society has chosen for us That tension between individual vision and the constricting power of circumstance finds a fresh and distinctive expression in Gail Godwins A Mother and Two Daughters a novel about three women who try to renovate their lives Here as in her previous novels Gail Godwin has drawn on the tradition of American individualism and adapted it to her concern with female lives In The Odd Woman 1974 her heroine was an unmarried woman of 32 whose selfmeasurements against a married woman colleague against a passionately feminist friend and against her own married lover only left her more assertively odd woman out without the anchors of marriage or ideology In Violet Clay 1978 her artist heroine fits in as a commercial bookjacket designer until she decides to go off and paint what she wants These characters have found no final answers to the problems of solitude but neither have they accepted any packaged solutions rejecting both dogmatic feminism and love affairs that are only consolations They prefer to live with the problematic facts of their natures A Mother and Two Daughters extends this faith in the individual toward a vision of community within the family the town and ultimately the nation In this novel Gail Godwins individualists are the female members of a family in crisis over the death of husband and father The widowed mother and her two daughters have lost their first illusions their bulwark is gone Their necessity is to pull together The mother is a nurse though she hasnt worked professionally for many years Lydia her 35yearold daughter is the family angel who married well and had two sons Cate her 39yearold twicedivorced sister is the rebel a political activist who feels at home nowhere As the novel progresses Lydia decides to divorce her husband and reject the selfabnegation of excessive love Cate who is given to intellectual vanity and an overweening sense of her own capabilities must come to grips with what she has accomplished in her life of edgy rebellion Although their mothers own life has been stable she becomes unsettled when the disordered lives of her daughters begin to throw a shadow over the promise of her own future As each woman exerts her claims on the others as each confronts the envy and anger the others can inspire Gail Godwin orchestrates their entanglements with great skill Cates struggle after a terrible argument with her sister is particularly moving The ghosts of her arrogant young dreams clustered around her like frightened children seeking protection from the lengthening shadows The light in the house was at that dreaded melancholyorange stage that had always set off her claustrophobia All her life even before she had anything to run from she had been fleeing this thickening dusty halflight as if it possessed some spiritual chemical that could destroy her Now she knew what the chemical was composed of it was made up of all the ingredients of her own history  those she could control and those she could not She had been fleeing from the premonition of just such a moment as this when that history would have had enough time to assume a shape As Lydia moves toward independence as Cate strives toward a greater acceptance of others and as their mother reconstructs her life Miss Godwin achieves a richness of affirmations In this generous novel illness and age are enablers And if time has taken the illusions and promises of youth from these women it has also pressed them toward recognizing the serious courtesy due one anothers pain In one of the bestrealized episodes of the novel Cate whose face is temporarily paralyzed by Bells palsy reaches accord with a former high school friend whose leg was shattered in the Vietnam War Antiwar activist and veteran  both battered by their choices  comfort each other with exquisite simplicity America is in flux as much as Americans are The beauty of the small Southern mountain town in which the novel is set the smug traditional morality of the towns elite even the mystery of Cates favorite Thoreauvian old uncle who chooses to live among his apple trees all contribute to the bright American colors of the novel Encroaching on these are darker shades Skylab is about to fall the Iranians hold American hostages the towns appearance is marred by garish shopping malls racial violence erupts Although Miss Godwin does not entirely succeed in negotiating the distance between family and nation between the personal and the political she clearly hopes these distances can be narrowed In an epilogue she moves forward in time to show the family rejoicing at the wedding of a brilliant and beautiful young black woman to a talented young white man Offering us a visionary glimpse of Americans in an extended kinship she describes a harmony among classes races and generations Ironically the major flaw of A Mother and Two Daughters arises out of Gail Godwins ability to modulate emotion She is a thoughtful craftsman countering her characters excesses of emotion with excesses of mind tempering their envy with concern their disapproval with compassion  to the point where she neutralizes the force of her narrative Perfectly balanced the novel is imperfectly pitched Its overmodulation produces a monotone of sweet reasonableness that seems inappropriate to the more painful aspects of her characters experience abortion death adultery A Mother and Two Daughters is nevertheless a remarkable novel In this spacious harmonious book  an expansive and imaginative celebration of American life  Gail Godwin retrieves her heroines from impasses Through characters who are recognizable contemporaries she takes us back to an Emersonian faith in the human capacity for good for betterment
THE PRESIDENT AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/us/the-president-as-chairman-of-the-board.html,WASHINGTON HE meets with his Cabinet once a week He takes off one afternoon a week usually Wednesday frequently to go riding Typically he puts in a ninehour day at the office and reads an hour or two in the evening But most of his day is spent performing ceremonial functions or trying to persuade people to do the things he wants done From the beginning President Reagans approach to government was inspired by his concept of a chairman of the board who delegates tasks to his Cabinet secretaries Having entered politics at the prodding of some California businessmen friends Mr Reagan is dedicated to bringing businesslike principles to his job and after a year in office he and his advisers have an almost obsessive concern about the proper use of his time The President does not strictly speaking run the Government  said an aide to Edwin Meese 3d the White House counselor who is Mr Reagans most influential adviser He makes the key decisions but the Government is run in the departments and agencies The President has spent the overwhelming portion of his first year in office on the economy for his political aides feel that issue impelled voters to elect him The White House husbands Mr Reagans resources so much that he has spoken lit tle o n abortion busing crime and other issues dear to his heart for fear of touching off controversies that would dissipate his politi cal capital At the apex of the Reagan Administration are three allimportant men who have responsibility for three fundamentally distinct aspects of the Government First is Mr Meese the only White House aide who is also an official member of the Cabinet He is responsible for development of policy among Cabinet members and directing Cabinet members to carry the policies out Second is James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff who oversees such political functions as relations with Congress specialinterest groups mayors governors the Republican Party and the press Third is Michael K Deaver who is most responsible for Mr Reagans personal time and travel With these men and only a handful of others Mr Reagan finds it comfortable to engage in giveandtake to ask questions and display his biases  or his ignorance In larger sessions the President sits by and listens asking questions and sometimes doodling on a note pad giving some the impression that his mind is wandering But Mr Reagan absorbs what he hears his aides say and will surprise others by discussing a specific point that might have come up only fleetingly at a previous meeting In the basement of the White House meanwhile are the offices of two key aides who insure that the work of Mr Baker and Mr Meese succeeds in interfacing as a Reagan aide might put it Craig Fuller secretary to the Cabinet mans the computerstored list of issue s that filter through the Cabinet which is broken down into six sepa rate councils The most famous of these is the National Secu rity Council the body that by statute oversees foreign policy issues  The others created solely for this Administration are the counc ils on economic affairs natural resources and environment health and human resources commerce and trade and food and agricultu re Each council has a member of the White House staff serving as its staff coordinator answerable to the Cabinet members and Mr Meese Sometimes the councils meet with Mr Reagan and sometimes only the subordinates of the Cabinet members meet to thrash the issues through The point of all this structure is to make sure that when an issue gets to the President it has been passed by all those who might be affected by it For a big project the Administration will resort to igs and sigs An ig is an interagency group set up for a specific problem such as the NorthSouth economic summit meeting at Cancun Mexico last October A sig convenes with senior Cabinet members present Closing the paper loop again in White House parlance is a lesserknown Presidential aide Richard G Darman the staff secretary Mr Darmans responsibility is to coordinate the flow of issues moving through Mr Bakers political apparatus and ultimately to the President himself He prepares the list of materials that gets sent to Mr Reagan in the morning and the evening The system is a neat one and almost symmetrical in its structure Naturally it is not foolproof but it seems to permit the President to use his time as he prefers Those who have studied the Cabinet system from the inside maintain that its main flaw is that too few directives go to the various Cabinet members from the White House The most prominent difficulties have arisen with the National Security Council its White House staff has been given diminished responsibility in this Administration for initiating policies or even inquiries Instead the Council staff members mostly receive reports from various constituent agencies compile them and pass them on to Mr Meese and the President But to senior aides at the White House no structure can insure that people will initiate ideas and learn to coordinate and synthesize issues Policy formulation often tends to fall to those who take the initiative Looking at a specific problem recently in which little creativity seemed to be emanating from a certain Cabinet council a senior White House aide shrugged At that level there are only two ways you can solve the problem he said You can change the people  or you can change the people

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR'S LIBEL SUIT MAY HELP HIS AILING POLITICAL CAREER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/11/us/massachusetts-governor-s-libel-suit-may-help-his-ailing-political-career.html,On the night when Edward J King upset Gov Michael S Dukakis in the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial primary in Massachusetts Mr Kings jubiliant supporters broke into chants of Dump The Globe It w as an i ndication that many of the celebrants felt The Boston Globe the ci tys dominant newspaper which had backed the liberal Mr Dukakis had treated the more conservative Mr King unfairly in its coverage Last week Governor King who faces a tough reelection battle against Mr Dukakis next fall filed a 36 million libel suit against The Globe He charged that the paper two of its columnists Dave Farrell and Robert Turner and its political cartoonist Paul Szep had held him up to ridicule scorn hatred and contempt Governor Kings aides insist that the lawsuit is simply a private matter of seeking justice against unfounded personal attacks on him by the paper But the suit has also led to speculation that the Governor is trying to rekindle the emotions of the people who voted for him four years ago Many of them have since become disenchanted by a series of political appointees who did not pan out and what they perceive as his inept handling of the state budget and Legislature Suit Seen as Fostering Split Some see the libel suit as underscoring a major split in the Massachusetts Democratic Party the states predominant party There are really two political cultures in the Massachusetts party said Chester Atkins the head of the State Senates powerful Ways and Means Committee and chairman of the state Democratic Party There is the industrial urban bluecollar ethnic constituency who voted for King and the professional intellectual high technology suburban liberals who back Dukakis The Globe which has emerged in the past decade as a potent local political force has taken strong liberal stands on such issues as busing to achieve racial balance in public schools Globe Owned and Run by Yankees It i s really the classic New England mill  a former state representative said referring to the newspap er Yankees own it andrun the newsroom but Irish staff all the oth er jobs In this split Governor Kings natural appeal is to the urban Irish constituency He came from a strict Irish Roman Catholic family attended Boston College the citys leading Catholic school and briefly played professional football As Governor he has pressed for and achieved mandatory prison sentences for such crimes as car theft and attacks on the elderly he has opposed abortion he has lowered taxes and he has cracked down on welfare abuse Gerard Morris the Governors press secretary points proudly to Mr Kings record Under Governor King we have eliminated the name Taxachusetts Mr Morris said alluding to the states reputation for high taxes Sharp Decline in Taxes Because of tax cuts introduced by Governor King and a 1980 state referendum that sharply reduced the amount of property tax the cities and towns may collect Massachusetts residents paid 19 billion less in taxes in 1981 than in 1979 Mr Morris asserted At the same time Mr Morris noted that Massachusetts had the second lowest unemployment rate at 76 percent in December of the 10 largest industrial states behind only Texas And personal per capita income in Massachusetts has climbed to 82 percent above the national average from 11 percent above the average when Governor King took office The Governors openly probusiness attitude with his tax cutting philosophy and reduction in state regulations has pleased many businessmen Stephen B Kay head of the Boston office of Goldman Sachs the investment firm recalled that when a 47 million bond package for the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency that his company recently helped put together nearly stalled King saved it he got on the phone himself and called the president of a key bank in California Controversial but Effective His style may be controversial but other governors wouldnt have bothered to do that Mr Kay added Under Governor King the state has cut the welfare caseload from 121000 to 109000 people and increased collections in welfare fraud cases by 5 million a year Governor Kings conservative policies have prompted some adversaries to call him a Reagan clone Unlike President Reagan however whose greatest strengths include a genial and likable personality Mr Kings greatest weakness in the view of many politicians journalists and even his supporters is how he comes across to others Mr King projects little personal warmth and has shown little ability to use television to his advantage  appearing wooden and often fractur ing the English language Governor King has also been badly bruised by a series of poor appointments to high state posts His original choice for Secretary of Elder Affairs was dismissed his first week in office after disclosures that he had falsified his academic credentials and an appointee as Insurance Commissioner was publicly linked to lawyers who had been convicted of insurance fraud One of Mr Kings closest aides Barry Locke

kickback scheme in Bostons subway system The Governors prestige was also tarnished last year when he lost control of the state budget process submitting four separate budgets in an effort to cope with the effects of the new property tax cuts Trails Dukakis in Poll Perhaps as a result of these troubles Governor King was the choice of only 15 percent of the respondents in his own latest public opinion poll taken last September with his chief rival former Governor Dukakis drawing 56 percent But Mr Morris Governor Kings press secretary recalled that in the summer of 1978 before the last Democratic primary a poll in The Boston Globe gave the incumbent Governor Dukakis 75 percent and Mr King only 13 percent Governor King has recently reorganized his campaign staff hiring several wellregarded professionals and his strategy would seem to be to reattract his old constituency The suit against The Boston Globe could aid such a move
EVOLUTION WINS AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/12/opinion/evolution-wins-again.html,Biblical literalists this time masquerading under the nonsense phrase scientific creationism have just lost the first skirmish of round three In Little Rock Ark Federal District Judge William R Overton has declared the Arkansas balanced treatment act unconstitutional because it forces biology teachers to purvey religion and a narrow sectarian concept of religion at that in science classrooms Round one was lost in 1968 also in Arkansas when the United States Supreme Court in Epperson v Arkansas threw out an antievolution statute much like the Tennessee law used to convict John T Scopes in the famous monkey trial of 1925 These laws specifically enjoined the teaching of evolution So creationists tried again round two asking not that evolution be excised from curricula but that their religious view be given equal time These laws passed in several states were also invalidated as violating the First Amendment and its insistence on separation of church and state In round three creationists have banished God from their legal language and advocated equal time for the same antediluvian views now renamed scientific creationism and supposedly free of religious content or motivation Judge Overton saw through the ruse and acted accordingly Arkansas Act 590 of 1981 now invalidated patently displays the firm mooring of creation science in the book of Genesis read literally  Creation science means the act declared in part sudden creation of the universe energy and life from nothing   separate ancestry for man and apes explanation of the earths geology by catastrophism including the occurence of a worldwide flood anda relatively recent inception of the earth and living kinds One might wonder why creationists expose their biblical literalism so openly Why do they not opt for more general language thus obfuscating the sectarian source of their doctrine They cannot for they are boxed in by their own extremism General language might permit such allegorical interpretations of creation as an equation of biblical days with millions of years  and a rough correspondence of Genesis with geology Yet to creationists this liberal theology is as evil as evolution itself and equally worthy of dogged attack The issue is not religious vs science for no such opposition exists but a particular narrow sectarianism opposed to knowledge and learning in general Thus 12 of the 17 individual plaintiffs wh o sued successfully to invalidate Act 590 are ministers and bishops I testified for the plaintiffs I only wish that the entire nation could have taken two weeks off and sat in Judge Overtons courtroom to witness the utter intellectual bankruptcy of scientific creationism It takes hour after hour to cut through clever rhetoric and to discover invariably nothing underneath Creationist geology the subject of my own testimony may serve as an example of their general approach Creationists face an acute dilemma because they believe that all creatures once lived together as products of Gods busy six days of precisely 24 hours yet they must admit that fossils occur in an orderly stratigraphic sequence throughout the world  trilobites in lower strata dinosaurs in the middle and large mammals at the top To separate a single creation into this invariable order they call upon Noahs cataclysmic flood and its consequences They invoke three mechanisms all invalid hydrodynamic sorting with densest fossils in the lowest strata ecological separation with inhabitants of mountaintops in upper strata or differential intelligence permitting the most resourceful reprobates to postpone their inevitable demise until the latest possible m oment At its core flood geology is not science because it calls explictly upon divine and miraculous suspension of natural laws to gather the waters together bring animals to the ark and care for them during a year in extremis When flood geology does make testable predictions in scientific form they have been conclusively falsified The lower strata are filled with delicate creatures that would not settle first from a universal flood advanced fishes and whales are in upper strata that record their time of evolution not their oceanic environment We professional evolutionists are obviously concerned and angry about the creationist resurgence but why should enyone else view it with more than mild amusement First although the etymology of the argument pits creation against evolution the attack is directed against all science if the earth is but 10000 years old then most of physics falls with the invalidation of radioactive decay as a method of dating and nearly all of astronomy goes in rebutting the claim that light from distant galaxies takes millions of years to reach us Creationism can only flourish in an ambiance of unquestioning authoritarianism Second the growth of creationism reflects no increased force of argument but the successes of a larger political program identified with the Moral Majority and other rightist groups that include defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment and a total ban on abortion Jesters often prepare the way for heavy roles This political setting also guarantees that creationism will not quietly recede after this recent rousing defeat I wish that the sports metaphor of my first sentence could have been baseball and strike three but I chose boxing and round three for a reason and the fight will continue for many more rounds Eternal vigilance to quote the old cliche is indeed the price of liberty

antiabortion cause when he was a Senator from New York sought the study when his responsibilites at the State Department broadened to include population policy Nick Eberstadt visiting fellow at the Harvard Center for Population Studies was hired for the task apparently on the basis of an article entitled Hunger and Ideology that he wrote for Commentary The article criticized past administrations for policies based too much on politics and too little on research In excerpts leaked from from his State Department study Mr Eberstadt notes that up to 60 million abortions are performed annually in the world most of them in poor countries under conditions that put the lives of mothers at risk This law is hypocritical he says of the foreign aid restriction To the extent that it is effective it imposes needless suffering on poor women in poor countries Since the full study has not yet been made public Mr Eberstadt declined to comment on it except to note that the abortion proposal was only one of 17 recommendations and in any case was consistent with his past writings on the subject O NE of the mercies of the bitter spell of winter now hardening the Potomac is that the topic has

WHEN A CHILD IS ILL AWAY AT SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/garden/when-a-child-is-ill-away-at-school.html,ONE question that arises when a student becomes ill at college or boarding school centers on whether the campus health services should automatically contact the family Providing that a student has reached the age of medical consent  which according to the American Medical Association varies from state to state  colleges usually adopt a handsoff policy on reporting the illness to the parent to encourage student indepen dence In New York Connecticut and New Jersey the age of medical conse nt is 18 Our policy which is probably similar to other colleges is to encourage students to call home without actually requiring them to do so explained Dr Allyn B Ley director of health services at Cornell University where about 1 percent of the 17000 undergraduates require hospitalization each year However in practical terms continued Dr Ley if we think a situation is so serious that it warrants parental alert we inform the family Were treading a fine line between patientdoctor confidentiality and an awareness that students are different from patients at random At Tufts University where the infirmary receives 20000 visits a year from an undergraduate population of 5000 a similar policy of student consent exists Dr George Rizzone the medical director agrees with Dr Ley that parents should be contacted in the event of serious illness but I make every effort to obtain the students permission first He said that some medical matters are so sensitive  such as sexually transmitted diseases or abortions that students may not want to divulge information to their parents At most prep schools there is no such thing as concealment Students who stay overnight in the infirmary for any reason are required to call home said Dr David Connell medical director of ChoateRosemary Hall in Wallingford Conn Boarding schools generally r equire a perm ission for treatment release from parents at the time a student en rolls This allows us to provide the necessary medical services in an emergency if we cant reach the family said Dr Thomas Eva ns medical director of the Lawrenceville School in Princeton NJ When parents are informed about a childs serious illness they may face some weighty decisions Should an unfamiliar doctor be permitted to perform surgery Is the health service or hospital staff qualified to provide adequate care Should surgery be delayed until the parents arrive Should the youngster be transported home The answers vary with the individual case according to school doctors private physicians and families who have gone through the experience Some school health facilities such as at Cornell and Harvard have sophisticated diagnostic equipment extensive inpatient services a fulltime doctor with top credentials and an association with a major medical center Some smaller schools far from major metropolitan hospitals offer adequate but less comprehensive services One way parents can evaluate their childs health service is to look for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care advised James Dilley executive director of the American College Health Association the national professional organization for college health personnel These groups send in independent teams of professionals to evaluate the services against nationally accepted standards relating to the quality of health care he explained Of course in the final analysis it comes down to an establishment of trust Mr Dilley observed When learning that a child away from home is ill parents should immediately talk to the doctor in charge of the case advised Dr Charles Greenhouse chief of staff of White Plains Hospital In addition to obtaining the facts from a professional you can get information about the doctors background and experience If youre still not satisfied ask your own doctor to make a referral said Dr Greenhouse He may not know anyone personally in a city a thousand miles away for example but he can consult the Directory of Medical Specialists to recommend a doctor with board certification Having adequate medical insurance can relieve some of the anxiety over a childs illness Before sending a youngster to college it is advisable for parents to look into the definition of dependent clause in their group of individual insurance plan Some policies continue to cover dependents while they are fulltime students past the age of 18 If not many colleges offer supplementary accident and health insurance programs  in addition to the basic insurance plans which are built into the tuition For more information on health programs in the academic community write to the American College Health Association 152 Rollins Avenue Rockville Md 20852

CAREY WEIGHS HIS GAINS AND MISTAKES OF 7 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/17/nyregion/carey-weighs-his-gains-and-mistakes-of-7-years.html,Governor Careys announcement Friday that he would not seek a third term stunned the political community yet was consistent with a career built on defying political wisdom to satisfy the priorities he saw The political tenacity displayed by Mr Carey has allowed him to build a hefty record of achievements in his seven years in office But it is one that he acknowledged is seen less than brilliantly through the haze of offhand remarks and quirks of style that have plagued his tenure in Albany This tenacity permitted him to achieve a widely hailed resolution of New York Citys desperate fiscal problems shortly after he took office by forcing through a package of taxes over the vehement opposition of the Republicanled Senate It allowed him to hold fast to his opposition to the death penalty in the face of overwhelming public support for it and to resist strenuous pressure from conservatives in the Legislature to end state financing of abortions for poor women That same tenacity however has sometimes led the Governor to resist compromise in situations where it would have allowed him to achieve some of what he wanted leaving him instead with nothing The Governor in an unusually candid assessment of his career with a small group of reporters in the Executive Mansion attributed many of his problems to his mischievous nature and his inability to resist the temptation sometimes to poke fun and laugh at myself The interview took place Friday over coffee a few hours after he had publicly announced his decision not to run on the condition that it not be published until today Its one thing to steal the show Mr Carey said but its another to botch the act and Ive botched the act a few times Nevertheless Mr Carey believes he will leave office with a good deal to point to and insisted that if he had chosen to run again he could have succeeded in being reelected Who would believe he asked that a state that couldnt get to market a city that couldnt get to market where we couldnt even get 750 million to keep the city afloat and alive in 1975 in one nights work in one program alone could launch the program for the capital improvement of the subways of 8 billion in 1981 You dont get there by accident Yet the enactment of the transit plan exemplified both what Mr Carey and his supporters consider the best elements of his style of government and what his critics cite as the worst At the urging of the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Richard Ravitch Mr Carey put forward in March 1981 a largescale plan of taxes and other fiscal devices to finance improvements in the subway system declared a transit emergency and challenged the Legislature  which had barely been consulted  to pass the program within 48 hours The Legislature did not act and Mr Carey permitted months to pass with little perceptible action In June the Governor appointed an outside commission to come up with a program angering the Legislature enough to take negotiations into its own hands On the July evening that the Legislature finally brought the measure to the floor approvi ng it near dawn after a round of excruciating political armtwisting Mr Carey was dining in Buffalo with a group of potential campaign contributors The result was that he was depriv ed of credit for the enactment of a program whose outlines were essentially his Denies He Was Bored Incidents like these  and there were several in the Governors second term  contributed to the perception that Mr Carey had lost control o f the Legislature and was bored with his job He responded to the first perception with a shrug  its not in my nature to claim credit he said  and to the second wit h a vehement denial Im not bored he insisted Im engrossed I sit for hours and plot and plan and scheme Sometimes I have to be curbed Some of the faithful around me say Look the ideas are coming out too fast how about cutting it down to one a week  While there is widespread acknowledgment that the Governor was always quick with ideas both Democratic and Republican critics have said repeatedly in recent years that he seemed increasingly distant from their execution Partly for this reason it is likely that Mr Carey will be most remembered for his activities in his first term when he entered office to find both New York City and New York State heading toward fiscal collapse  the result of huge debts and fiscal gimmicks that during the 1960s and early 1970s seemed to be remarkable feats of creative financing that allowed generous new social programs to be enacted A Nightmarish Situation Immersing himself of necessity quite personally in negotiations with the city its banks and its unions Mr Carey gained wide credit in helping to achieve the resolution of a situation he described as nightmarish A few months later he was forced once again to undertake dramatic action to salvage the financial stability of the state and several of its quasiindependent agencies  creations designed to permit the public generosity of the late Gov Nelson A Rockefeller He was able to do so without any major reductions in the services the state provided And by the end of his first term aided by the effect of soaring inflation on the states progressive income tax Mr Carey was able to claim credit for having enacted tax cuts that trimmed 2 billion from the revenues the state otherwise would have collected With the fiscal crisis as something of a scapegoat Mr Carey was also able to adopt a style that relied far less than his recent predecessors on the purchase of legislative support through overt patronage  a decision made easier for him by the lukewarm support he received from Democratic Party bosses during his campaign Cites Lack of Patronage In later years he cited this lack of patronage as one cause for the difficulty he was having in getting his programs through the Legislature  although he has managed in recent months to find highpaying state positions for loyal employees who had left his central staff Whatever the reason relations between the Governors office and the Legislature changed dramatically during Mr Careys tenure During his first term Mr Carey suffered the first successful vote to override a Governors veto in more than a century as well as the first rejection of a gubernatorial appointee in recent memory While Mr Careys style was often confrontational he seldom lost his temper in public  although early in his tenure he was reputed to have subjected aides to occasionally sharp tonguelashings A notable exception to his public calm came in a dispute between him and Maurice H Nadjari the Special State Prosecutor for Political Corruption The Governor tried to have Mr Nadjari dismissed and the prosecutor responded with an allegation that Mr Carey was trying to cover up wrongdoing by highlevel Democratic officials Mr Carey exploded with rage but Mr Nadjari was given six months to finish his work and eventually indicted the state Democratic chairman Patrick J Cunningham The Governor severed his ties with Mr Cunningham although the indictments were subsequently dismissed by the courts Although Mr Carey was sometimes accused by political opponents of taking advantage of state facilities  such as the state air fleet  for personal use his administration remained free of political scandal A Rescue Operation Little in Mr Careys second term could match the drama of what he achieved in his first  What am I supposed to do Save New York City twice he asked  but it is his second term for which the Governor said he would prefer to be remembered That was a rescue operation Mr Carey said referring to the first term but beyond rescue is recovery Anybody can be a lifeguard but what this state needed was a fiscal physiotherapist The Governor reeled off perhaps a dozen achievements around the state that actions during his first term had permitted the state to finance during his second  from the Niagara Falls Convention Center to the Carrier Dome stadium in Syracuse to the protection of the Long Island shoreline  none of which had a major sta tewide impact but each of which was a major development in its community Mr Carey also has pointed out repeatedly that unlike the current Administration in Washington his administration was able to bring its budget into balance without causing major hardships for those groups that do not represent strong political constituencies  the poor the mentally ill and retarded or those in correctional institutions Cites the Press For his declining popularity and the lack of recognition he received for the accomplishments of his second term Mr Carey cited two reasons The first was what he described as his sense of humor and mischief  which led to several extraordinary political gaffes particularly in the past two years It led for example to his offer to drink a glass of toxic chemicals to prove that a state office building contaminated with them was safe for state workers  an act for which he later apologized The second was the press which he said had increasingly focused attention on his style instead of the substance of his actions Mr Carey called himself a victim particularly of the circulation war between The Daily News and The New York Post quoting the publisher Walter Annenberg as telling him See the newspaper war in New York In a newspaper war everyone gets killed and you better watch out The Governor had harsh words for The Posts Page Six which has frequently carried unflattering items about him And he said he did not enjoy total popularity with at least one feature writer for The Daily News apparently an allusion to Jimmy Breslin who has repeatedly savaged the Governor in articles about Society Carey Mr Breslin was one of several former allies from whom Mr Carey became distant during his terms in office The Governor is known as a man who trusts his own instincts first and last seldom seeking advice from outside his very inner circle and more often than not from few others than his longtime secretary Robert J Morgado Mr Morgado the Governor said was the only member of his staff who had known of his decision not to run since he first made it definite last November While the Governor accepted his share of the blame for his lowered popularity in recent months he added that where I suffer most in public esteem happens to be in the largest circulation areas of those two newspapers Toll of a Third Campaign Nevertheless the Governor and his aides portrayed his decision not to seek reelection as the result not of his low popularity but of weighing the benefits to be gained against the toll of a third campaign and term  or perhaps a loss  on his family his marriage and the memory of his accomplishments thus far He repeatedly denied that his low popularity ratings had been an element in his decision asserting that he had turned to his sons on election night in 1978 and whispered Never again Mr Carey asserted that if he achieved what he wanted in this years budget what is there for the Governor to do in a third term Absent a major crisis or future political ambitions on his part Mr Carey said the third term did not represent an opportunity I had to seek or a duty I had to perform The Governor also implied that his recent marriage to Evangeline Gouletas had been a factor in his decision When we were married he said we said wed like to prove that you could have a personal life and a public life in a laterlife marriage and be able to enjoy it Well I couldnt quite prove that Other people close to the Governor said he was also concerned that if he ran and lost Mrs Carey  whose prior marital history and affiliation with American Invsco Corporation a major realestate development firm caused several embarrassing reports in the press  would blame herself a situation that the Governor whose family has always come before his politics was intent on avoiding Successful Primary Bid Mr Carey has had no more to do with regular Democratic Party politics than necessary since the state le aders failed to support himin his succes sful primary against Howard J Samuels in 1974 and saidhe would not get actively involved in choosing a successor But he emphasized that he hoped the field would broaden beyond the the eight now in apparent contention for the Democratic nomination He named perhaps a half dozen Democratic Congressmen from New York as possibilities recalling that eight years ago he too was a virtual unknown statewide Questioned about several of those already exploring the possibility of running Mr Carey gave only Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink with whom he has often spar red an unre served assessment as qualified The others he said would have to show their programs and prove themselves although he added that if his Lieutenant Governor Mario M Cuomo is running on my record Id have to be very commendatory to him Relations between Mr Carey and Mr Cuomo have been icy in the past year Mr Careys relationship with his first Lieutenant Governor Mary Anne Krupsak was even cooler Miss Krupsak withdrew from the Governors ticket in 1978 shortly before he announced for reelection and ran against him unsuccessfully in the primary Few Regrets Mr Carey said he would leave office with few regrets  one he said is that the controversy over the rotation of judges by Chief Judge Lawrence A Cooke of the Court of Appeals had doomed any chance of court reform during his term another is that he ever got himself involved in the 1977 race for Mayor of New York City in which he pledged to commit himself to Mr Cuomo but later abandoned him for Mayor Koch The Governor would not say how he would like to be remembered  As soon as you talk about being remembered you put yourself among those who fear being forgotten he said But in closing he offered this thought Ten years from now I hope the people forget the misery and remember the good times I tried to make no one unhappy I find it hard to think of anybody Ive hurt And if anybody says I have let them know before I leave I didnt mean it
Sunday Observer,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/17/magazine/sunday-observer.html,By Russell Baker Lost Genius PATRICK MCDONNELL Do you ever feel sad about all the geniuses who might exist but dont Of course not and I wouldnt either if antiabortion people didnt keep talking about Beethoven One of their most provocative arguments against abortion is that Beethoven might never have existed if abortion had been available in his mothers day They note that the economic and physical health of the Beethoven family and of Ludwig himself were the sort that bode ill for a wellrounded life and are commonly used to justify abortion today Given easy access to abortion might Mother Beethoven not have ended her pregnancy before Ludwigs birth Possibly so and the possibility is sad to contemplate Think how much drearier the world would be without Beethovens Sixth Symphony and Fourth Piano Concerto Or those fantastic quartets Well fortunately abortion was discouraged in Mother Beethovens day and Ludwig came into existence I am still saddened however because the line of thought opened by the antiabortionists makes me think of all the other geniuses the world has lost without knowing it I am reasonably certain for instance that good as Beethoven was an infinitely greater composer was due to be born in Europe early in the 19th century Reasonably certain you ask How so My answer is that there is always somebody better coming along The first problem is to bring him into existence As we know the composer destined to top Beethoven failed to appear What became of him Its unlikely his mother denied us his genius by a trip to the abortionist As we know from the Beethoven example abortion was relativly rare in the late 18th century and no more commonplace by the early 19th century when our new musical genius was scheduled for birth I suspect the mother either contracted smallpox or was killed during pregnancy when she was caught in the cross fire of a minor skirmish during the Napoleonic wars Of course you cant prove conclusively that this extraordinary genius would have cast Beethovens name in the shadow if musket fire hadnt cut do wn his mother But then if Beethovens mother had had anabortion we couldnt prove that the abortionist deprived the world of the Sixth Symphony either Whats worse about Beethovens case we wouldnt care If Beethoven hadnt existed how many people today would be sitting around saying Isnt it sad that the world doesnt have Beethovens Sixth Symphony That would seem as silly to a lot of people as sitting around saying What a pity that a poor womans death in a minor musket skirmish in 1809 should have deprived us of the magnificent Tuttlekinder Concerto Well theres nothing silly about mourning the fact that the world will never hear the Tuttlekinder Concerto the most moving music never composed The world is a poorer place because genius was silenced in the womb I become especially depressed about all the geniuses who dont exist in our present century We need geniuses badly nowadays and about the best we get are technicians Is this because our geniuses are being abor ted by a society indifferent to its own fate I doubt it Oh maybe weve lost a halfdozen geniuses or so to abortion and adm ittedly thats a terrible loss but I suspect its negligible compared with the hordesweve lost to wars and automobile accidents I have in mind two dozen brilliant European political personalities with the genius to weld Europe from Moscow to the Atlantic into one great peaceful productive political system between 1919 and the present day The names of these geniuses will never be known The first generation of them was killed in its youthful entirety in the trenches of World War I leaving Europe under the management of commonplace politicians incapable of anything but getting on with World War II The second generation who would by now have turned Europe into a dazzling model of civilization failed not only to be born but also to be conceived The fathers essential to their existence had been killed in World War I And so we live in a world denied its rightful geniuses and it is sad how wantonly we squander them and its good to have the antiabortionists reminding us of how cavalierly we ignore the genius shortage I am sorry they cant get beyond Beethoven though and persuade people to mourn for all the great composers writers artists and statesmen who would have made the world so much more beautiful and wise but whose names we will never know because their mothers or potential fathers were terminated suddenly by bullets bombs and bayonets On the other hand thinking too powerfully along these lines leads to moral dilemma Of course abortion is sad when it leads Mother Beethoven to deny us Ludwig But suppose it is Mother Hitler denying us Adolf Genius alas also has its dark side
PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MATTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/us/president-s-news-conference-on-foreign-and-domestic-matters.html,Following is a transcript of President Reagans news conference in Washington yesterday as recorded by The New York Times Following is a transcript of President Reagans news conference in Washington yesterday as recorded by The New York Times MR REAGAN Please I was going to have an opening statement but I decided that what I was going to say I wanted to get a lot of attention so Im going to wait and leak it So we can start with the first question Plight of Jobless Q Mr President since you took office a year ago thereve been  unemployment has shot up to more than nine million people the recession has deepened two Republican Congressmen say that the tax increases that you may propose will hurt the little guy and give a bonanza to the big corporations My question is what are you going to do about the people who are undergoing great hardships now And hows it possible for you to propose deep social  deep cuts in the social programs in view of all this suffering A Well Helen first of all with regard to last year compared to this year I realize theres been an increase in unemployment Its been a continuation of an increase that got underway in the last several months of 1980 There are about  well the unemployment rate average in 81 81 percent It averaged 74 percent in all of 1980 but that is a kind of an unfair comparison because it was increasing very much more in the last six months of 1980 I have the greatest sympathy I think anyone does for those people who are unemployed On the other hand comparing this to the beginning of our term there are a million peop le more working than there were in 1980 and there will be more people actually working not counting the unemployed that might go back to work in 1982 just in connection with our growth But that still isnt an answer for the unemploye d But the people today have a lower interest rate than they had when we started The inflation rate is sizably lower than it was when we took office And so we have in  set a program that has not  and this has not been true before in any of the recessions of the past decade or so  we have in place a program now that is just getting underway that is designed to reduce the unemployment and to resolve these problems that are so bothersome today The first part of our tax program went into effect thats another additional thing The people have a lower rate of taxes than they did have Part of that has been eliminated by the automatic increase passed by the previous Administration in the Social Security payroll tax But there will be another tax cut in July and in this month we have had for the first time the elimination of the marriage penalty in taxes But as these tax rates and these reductions in tax rates begin to take effect then Im quite sure were going to see an upswing in the economy and that is the answer to their problem Now as to the cuts in social reforms most of what we have done in that regard has not been a cut there has not been a cut in the overall spending on human resources Actually there is an increase over the year before and there will be an increase in 83 over 82 and on down the line We have reduced the rate of increase in those programs but much of the cut is aimed at trying to eliminate from the rolls those people who I think are unfairly benefiting from those programs Nothing has happened to change the situation of the person who is totally dependent on the Government for help nor are we going to change those things Q Not monopolizing Mr President can you answer the LoftonKemp charge about the  hurting the little guy A Well I dont think were going to that we are doing that And Im going to have a little talk with them I think that they are basing some of their charge on speculation of things that have been talked about widely so far in the media and they have not heard from us what it is were talking about or what were planning Sanctions on Soviet Q Mr President its been three weeks now since you announced thesanctions against the Soviet Union in connect ion with Poland What effect if any have they had And if they ha vent had any effect what next and when A Well I think they have had an effect although theres no question the situation in Poland is deteriorating They have tried to present it as moderating it isnt The people are still in prison there is no communication with Solidarity or between the military Government and the people and the military law is still in effect We think however that there has been an impression made and we have held back on some things additionally that we can do things that we will consider that can add to the steps that weve already taken Ive had a lengthy communication from the Pope He approves what we have done so far he believes that it has been beneficial and yet were not going to wait forever for improvement in the situation there We have other steps that we can take Yes Bruce Outlook in Middle East Q Mr President now that Secretary Haig is back from the Mideast do you know of any new positive grounds for optimism about reaching achievement on the Palestinian autonomy issue And do you regard as crucial reaching some sort of agreement before April when the Israelis are scheduled to withdraw complete the withdrawal from the Sinai A Well theres no question about that being the toughest problem in the Middle East settlement We wont set a deadline of any kind on when that must be decided The Secretary has been on a factfinding trip and will be there again although no date has been set for that We want to help if we can If we can come up with some ideas that might be helpful in the autonomy talks that is the next step under the Camp David process And so as I say we wont set a deadline but were most hopeful that we can be a help and that they will at least by the Sinai time get down to lets say a kind of a plan for proceeding Sam TaxExempt Stance Q Mr President on Jan 8 the Justice Department announced a decision concerning taxexempt status for certain schools that clearly gave aid and comfort to racial discrimination Then in subsequent da ys you began a series of steps to sort of go back from that My ques tion is what happened Are you responsible for the original deci sion or did your staff put something over on you A Sam no one put anything over on me No Sam the buck stops at my desk Im the originator of the whole thing and Im not going to deny that it wasnt handled as well as it could be But I think that what we actually saw was confusion and it was rather widespread and encouraged about what we had not anticipated the reaction because we were dealing with a procedural matter And it was interpreted by many of you as a policy matter reflecting a change in policy And then therefore when we went forward you said well then this was another change back in policy What we were trying to correct was a procedure that we thought had no basis in law that the Internal Revenue Service had actually formed a social law and was enforcing that social law And we think that thats a bad precedent and its a bad thing to do And so we  there was no basis in the law for what they were doing So what we set out to do was to stop  to change that procedure and stop  the Internal Revenue Service from doing this and then to have Congress implement with law the proper procedure I am opposed at every fiber of my being of discrimination and to have set in law the fact that tax exemptions could be denied to schools and educational institutions that practiced discrimination Now as I say it probably wasnt handled as well as it could because it being in our minds a procedural matter  and in my mind certainly  we didnt anticipate that it was going to be as misinterpreted as it was And we since  what we have accomplished with what we did was weve prevented the IRS from determining national social policy all by itself Itll now be by elected officials the Congress Well continue to prohibit tax exemptions for schools that discrimination and for the first time that will be the law of the land And we helped to reserve the rights and liberties of religious schools as long as they dont discriminate Q But sir if I may in your original Jan 8 decision you didnt didnt ask for legislation you simply said unless Congress acted It wasnt until the firestorm that you then asked for legislation A No because we went right ahead I was having talks with Senators about this Maybe we didnt act as swiftly as we could have  and as I say Im not defending that we proceeded on a course that was as well planned as it might have been And just  so we were mistaken in that regard But dont judge us by our mistakes  Im probably going to make more of them But judge us how well we r ecoverand solve the situation Contacts With Press Q Mr President a few days ago Mr Clark your new National Security Adviser issued a series of guidelines for contact with the press by officials of your Administration where classified information is to be discussed Two questions sir First of all will it be your policy to advocate the use of all legal means including lie detectors to determine who is leaking classified information if classified information is leaked And second do you think it will be possible for Administration officials to conduct a normal discourse of briefings with reporters when nearly everything pertaining to foreign affairs is classified to some degree or other A What were doing is simply abiding by the existing law It is against the law to  for those who are not authorized  to declassify to release classified information And I know that Ive been told repeatedly that what is happening is nothing new that its been done under Administrations But I do think that it reached a new high here of the leaks that were destructive to the foreign policy we were trying to conduct that endangered delicate negotiations that were going on and all were doing is implementing the law It is against the law for anyone to release this information We need to protect national security and our ability to conduct foreign policy And as to any specifics Bill Clark is drawing up some specifics of that kind but they will all be within the law And theyll have to be judged what particular things are done are judged on the individual case It will not interfere with our determination to have an open Administration  present information that properly belongs to the press  but we must stop that leak which as I say several times has really endangered things that we were trying to accomplish And were not doing anything that as I say is not in the law today and we will certainly protect the constitutional rights of our citizens Q Sir if I may follow up would you advocate the use of lie detectors as a Pentagon o fficial has in another similar case and would you car e to give us any of the specifics where the release of that informat ion gave you difficulty with national policy A Well the trouble is if I tried to give you specifics on that then Im leaking and no because if I think that anyone of you could see the situation in which you are dealing on a very sensitive matter with someone and suddenly those people youre dealing with read something in the paper that enrages them and youre put in a position of trying to say it isnt so please believe us And this has happened on a number of occasions Jerry A No no Jerry then Ill get you Attitude Toward Blacks Q Mr President to follow up on Sams question The taxexempt issue is just one of a series that some blacks are saying  series of incidents that some blacks say point to the fact that you ignore the interests and concerns of blacks How do you respond to it A I respond to it with the simple answer that it isnt true And I know that there are some leaders in various organizations and so forth who have said things of this kind But I am for affirmative action I am against quotas I have lived long enough to know a time in this country when quotas were used to discriminate not end discrimination I have already explained myself with regard to the discrimination in education And I think that my record will stand for itself if anyone wants to look at it that I have been on the side of opposition to bigotry and discrimination and prejudice and long before it ever became a kind of national issue under the title of civil rights And my life has been spent on that side Q To follow up Mr President black unemployment for example was 124 percent when you took office its now 17 percent What do you tell blacks in terms of what you plan to do to deal with the problem A Well one of the things thats needed I think was illustrated in the local paper on Sunday I made it a point to count the pages of helpwanted ads in this time of great unemployment there were 24 full pages of classified ads of employers looking for employees What we need is to make more people qualified to go and apply for those jobs and were going to do everything we can in that regard Status of Rickover Q Mr President we hear reports that Admiral Rickover vented his tubes of a bit of radioactive steam the other day when he met with you in the White House Can you tell us sir whether he has rejected y our offer for him to be the White House nucl ear power adviser and whether hes rejected the Navys offer for hi m to stay on beyond Jan31 in the transition period for his successor  A Well I dont know about the latter Hes not interested in being just a White House adviser and I do know that the naval offer was one in which they truly believed that he had great service to still render and that he would have an office in the Secretary of Navy and a staff and that he would be there where he could make a great contribution Now I dont know what his decision has been on that I would hope that he would accept that because he could be of service to his country Although I know this if he doesnt want to serve it would be difficult to impose on him because thats been a long lifetime of sterling service to this nation Q He has turned down the White House job though A Yes He explained to me and I could understand that that that didnt sound very much like what hed be interested in Yes maam PICK UP FIRST ADD REAGAN TEXT View on Abortion Q Mr President as you know this Congress has attached the most restrictive antiabortion language to the Health and Human Services money bill It would ban all abortions for lowincome women except if the mothers life would be endangered by completing the pregnancy and it would make no exceptions for rape or incest My question to you is and I would like to have a followup if one of your daughters were unfortunate enough to be raped and become pregnant as a result would you agree with this law that she should be forced to carry that pregnancy to term A I have been one who believes that abortion is the taking of a human life and I know the difficulty of the question that you ask I also do know that course I wont answer it in that personal term because  but I do know that I once approved the law in California that allowed that as a justification in the line of selfdefense just as a mother has a right in my view to protect her own life at the expense of the life of the unborn child I am very concerned because I have found out since that that was used as a gigantic loophole in the law and it was just  it literally led to abortion on demand on the plea of rape Now I wish I could have a solid answer for you On that basis I would be hesitant to approve abortion on that basis So   Q May I ask you something on a related point There is pending in the Senate a constitutional amendment sponsored by Senator Hatch that would permit Congress and any state to ban abortions for all women rich or poor When Senator Hatch opened his hearings on that he said that his religion prompted him to support that amendment And at the same time as you know there are many other religious faiths that do consider them invasion of privacy Also in view of that devisiveness and in view of the fact that the public opinion polls show that most Americans favor freedom of choice on abortion have you given this any second thought or rethought your position at all A I cant say that I have really looked at or studied this particular proposal I can just say to you that following up on the hearings that were held on the Hill as to when life begins I think that everyone has overlooked the real finding the fact that they could not resolve the issue of when life begins was a finding in and of itself If we dont know then shouldnt we morally opt on the side that it is life If you came upon an immobile body and you yourself could not determine whether it was dead or alive I think that you would decide to consider it alive until somebody could prove it was dead  you wouldnt get a shovel and start covering it up And I think we should do the same thing with regard to abortion Departure of Allen Q Mr President why was it necessary to dismiss Richard Allen and restructure the foreign policy operation at the White House when the Justice Department cleared Mr Allen and two press conferences ago you told us that the foreign policy apparatus here was operating just fine A The changes that have been made with regard to the operation method were already under consideration We did not dismiss Richard Allen and I think he himself knew that it would be difficult for him after all that had happened but hes still a part of the Administration He continues right now helping us Were restoring PFIAB  I use the Washington custom of putting the initials together in a name because its difficult for me to always remember that that means the Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board which I think was a very valu  I got it right  a very valuable thing that was discontinued a few years ago Were restoring that We have appointed a board and have a chairman and he is serving as a consultant at this point which does not mean that thats all that he s going to do But he is a part of the Adm inistration and I know that he was cleared and regret the whole thin g that took place Judy Turnover to States Q Mr President how concerned are you that any move you make to turn over control to the states of such things as welfare and education may result in some inequality for the people who live in those states A I dont really believe it will because I was a Governor of one I know how well states can operate There might have been a time in our history when there were things in states that varied to a great extent but then people moved from those states if they were unhappy with the way government was working Thats one of the great secrets of our freedom  is that were a federation of sovereign states I am convinced that well for one thing that was lacking in those early days was a lack on the part of the Federal Government it is where Constitutional rights are concerned I believe in many of the things the Federal Government has usurped in the last halfcentury and is now doing that they could be better run at the state level But I also believe that the Federal Government has an obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of even the least individual among us wherever he may be if those rights are being denied And to do so at the point of bayonet if necessary Q Mr President to follow what about the people who cant afford to move from state to another And also what do you say to the governors who are going to be receiving perhaps less revenue than they are currently A Were hoping theyre not going to be receiving less revenue What has happened  and from my own experience of having to deal with programs that were mandated by the Federal Government and with help from Federal funds  most of those programs are not totally federally funded theyre a combination But we found that the restritions imposed by the Federal Government the red tape the administrative overhead was such that had we had more leeway more freedom we could have given better service to the people we were trying to help at a much lower cost  Its like t he one incident that I spoke of in New York the other day in my rem arks of a county with an elderly citizens warmfood program And they were spending fiftysome thousand dollars and only 3000 of tha t was going for food The 50000 was going for administrativ e help Theyre now doing it with volunteers Theyre spending 60 00 in food feeding twice as many people and it only costs 6000 not 50some thousand Q What about the people who cant afford to move though from one state to another A Well if their constitutional rights are being violated then we have a duty  the Federal Government  to go in and see that they arent violated Cut in Capital Investment Q A major goal of your economic program was to stimulate capital investment and yet the Commerce Department now reports that capital investment will be down this year Why do you think that businesses have failed to respond to the incentives that you provided and how will that affect your program in the future A I dont think they have failed I know that a great many industries have the plans already for modernization and expansion I think theres a little caution at work and perhaps part of that is waiting to see what the Federal Reserve System is doing because theres been an upsurge for example in the money supply just recently which sends I think the wrong signal to the money markets In other words they want to be more sure that interest rates and inflation are going to continue coming down as they have been And I know that the entire steel industry has a multibilliondollar expansion plan They have personally informed me that they are ready to go forward with this plan And I think were just seeing a little caution they want to make sure before they proceed with them But its  in a number of other industries that the plans are there  ready to go and be implemented Q Mr President to follow up if you are concerned about the Feds handling of the money supply would you agree with those people on Capitol Hill who have called for Mr Volkers resignation A Well I cant respond to that because the Federal Reserve system is autonomous The employees or the members of that commission are term appointees theyre not serving at anyones pleasure I just  theres no way that I can comment on that LieDetector Tests Q Mr President Id like to go back to a question that Bill Plant asked He asked if you endorsed the use of lie detectors on members of the Administration to determine if they had leaked stories Do you think the use of lie detectors is a good idea in that case A I have to say that any of those things  to answer that that has to be the specific case I know in one agency in the Government right now a major agency there are some people voluntarily taking these because they themselves knew that they had association with and knowledge of a tremendous leak that occurred But all of those  Im awaiting the plan that Bill Clark comes up with But I think any of the things that are prescribed by law are there for a reason and it will depend on the individual case Q In addition Mr President theres a recent White House directive that goes well beyond protecting national security secrets which I think we can all understand is important Thats a directive that requires Administration officials to clear interviews with the press with TV and major print interviews with the White House before they accept them And Im wondering if youre at all concerned that that gives the perception of you having a closed Administration or if you think this directive might have a chilling effect on reporters efforts to gather the news A No I dont believe so All were doing is what every Administration before us has done  and we hadnt been doing Its simply a case so that we all know what is going on And also there can come  weve seen the situation when it would have been very I think educational for the people and advantageous for us if two or three particular issues could have been brought before the public and because of not checking with each other we found three separate departments all going at once with their statements So it gives us the opportunity to make sure that all of us are familiar with where theyre going or if we have something that we think would be additional on what theyre going to talk about from their department that we can see they get that Why Inrease Arms Q Mr President we know that in the next few months youre going to be very interested in having more money for defense spending and I wonder if you explain philosophically the b asic cause of this Is it to be able to deter Soviet aggression or as a negotiation technique wit h the Soviet Union And is there a concern that weapons produced may eventually be weapons used A I hope and pray with all my might that the weapons wont be used I also happen to believe that that is the purpose If military defense is well done it doesnt have to be used And weve never gotten in a war because we were too strong But the purpose of this military program  were engaged in rebuilding something that was allowed to deteriorate very badly over recent years We are way behind where we should be now Our economic program regard to budgets and all would be minimal today if we were simply carrying on with a defense establishment that had been properly maintained I might also point out that with all the argument and concern over that in these times of economic stress that were spending a smaller percentage of the gross national product on the military than has been spent in many many years past in peacetime But the purpose is if were to sit down with the enemy potential enemy and talk arms reductions which were doing right now were going to be far more successful if that adversary knows that the alternative is a build up to a commensurate level with him on our side So up until now in previous negotiations they havent had to make any concession because we were unilaterally disarming But now I think its all explained in a cartoon that one of your publications used some time ago and that was Brezhnev speaking to a general in his own army and he said I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it Helen did you  I think Mary got up before you did Helen so Ill take her question Reagans Charitable Gifts Q Mr President in New York last week you called upon the rich to help the poor in this present economic difficulty Are you planning to increase your own contributions to private charity to set an example to the rich people of this country to do more for the poor A Mary  Helen I just want you to know whenever you speak from now on Im shuttin up No Mary Ill tell you you give me a chance to explain something and its been of great concern to me I realize the publicity that has attended upon the tax returns of someone in my position And I realize that some have noticed what seemed to be a small percentage of deductions for worthwhile causes  and that is true And Im afraid it will be true this year because I havent changed my habits But I also happen to be someone who believes in t ithing the giving of a tenth But I have for a number of years done some of that giving in ways that are not taxdeductible with regard to individuals that are being helped And Im afraid that to avoid future questions of this kind maybe beginning this year Im going to have to start publicly doing some things But my conscience is clear as to what I have been giving and it has been for the reason that Ive just told you that the tax law doesnt say you help people not organizations that you can or not by way of an organization that you can deduct it So you can be watching itll be this same situation this year Next year Ill try to be more public with what Im doing I have to go now Thank you
PRESIDENT ACCEPTS BLAME IN DISPUTE ON TAX EXEMPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/20/us/president-accepts-blame-in-dispute-on-tax-exemption.html,President Reagan said today that he was the originator of the move to grant taxexempt status to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race He accepted blame for his Administrations failure to anticipate the outcry caused by the decision Im the originator of the whole thing and Im not going to deny that it wasnt handled as well as it could be Mr Reagan said thisafternoon at his seventh televised news conference At another pointhe said Ma ybe we didnt act as Transcript of news session page A20 quickly as we could have in proposing legislation outlawing taxexempt status for such schools But dont judge us by our mistakes he added Im probably going to make more of them But judge us as  how well we recover and solve the situation Federal Reserve Board Criticized Appearing relaxed and in good humor on the eve of the first anniversary of his inauguration as President Mr Reagan touched on these other domestic policy issues  He criticized the Federal Reserve Board for the recent upsurge in the money supply and took a neutral stand when asked if its cha irmanPaul A Volcker should resign It was his fi rst indirect criticism of Mr Volcker since August when he said the Federal Reserve was being overly restrictive in controlling the g rowth of money supply  He defended the use of polygraph tests on Government officials and restrictions on interviews with reporters as a means of curtailing unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information on foreign policy and national security  He said he had the greatest sympathy for those unemployed because of the current recession but predicted that with his economic program in place Im quite sure were going to see an upswing in the economy  He refused to answer a question about whether he would personally approve an abortion if a member of his family was a rape victim but he said he would be hesitant to allow the use of Government funds for abortions under such circumstances Revenue Service Authority Mr Reagan vigorously defended the view that the Internal Revenue Service had no authority to act unilaterally in 1970 to deny taxexempt status to private schools that practice discrimination There was no basis in law for what they were doing he said referring to the 11yearold practice that his Administration rescinded Jan 8 Civil rights groups stress that the service acted only after being ordered to do so by Federal courts Only Congress could authorize the denial of taxexempt status in such cases Mr Reagan asserted adding that he was now proposing legislation because I am opposed with every fiber of my being to discrimination Wearing a dark blue suit and blueandred tie the President began the news conference with a lighthearted explanation about why he would have no opening statement I decided that what I was going to say I wanted to get a lot of attention he said so Im going to wait and leak it Many of the ensuing questions dealt with the matter of taxexemptions for private schools that discriminate racially a controversy that his aides have been struggling to contain for several days With a broad smile Mr Reagan denied a questioners suggestion that the decision to permit taxexemptions for such schools had been made without his full participation Decision Misunderstood No one put anything over on me Mr Reagan said adding that the decision had been misunderstood in ways we had not anticipated What we were trying to correct was a procedure that we thought had no basis in law that the Internal Revenue Service had actually formed a social law and was enforcing that social law Mr Reagan said And we think that thats a bad precedent and is a bad thing to do And so there was no basis in the law for what they were doing In making this assertion Mr Reagan was disputing the view of civil rights organizations and others who note that the Internal Revenue Service originally denied taxexempt status to certain schools only after being ordered to do so by Federal courts The United States Supreme Court summarily affirmed in 1971 a lower court ruling that tax laws prohibit exemptions to schools violating the national public policy against discrimination Two Cases in Carolinas Federal appeals courts have reaffirmed this conclusion in each of the four cases decided since then including the cases involving Bob Jones University in Greensville SC and Goldsboro Christian Schools in Goldsboro NC whose appeal for taxexempt status is now before th e Supreme Court It was the case of Bob Jones University and Goldsboro Christian Schools that the Administration had asked be declared moot on Jan 8 on the ground that the revenue service had no authority to deny them taxexemptions The position that the service acted lawfully in the first place also received support today from the United States Civil Rights Commission The commission an independent bipartisan group called on Mr Reagan today to enforce the law and exercise his ample authority to deny tax exemptions to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race Two Republicans and two Democrats on the commission were at a meeting Monday night in which the statement was approved Salvage Operation Since the original announcement 10 days ago by the Justice and Treasury Departments on the taxexempt issue the White House has cond ucted what aides say is a salvage opera tion prompted by a fear that Mr Reagan was being unfairly perce ived as racist Originally for example the Administration said there were no plans to submit legislation to outlaw taxexemptions for private schools that discriminate racially Then last week the White House announced that in fact such legislation would be presented Today Mr Reagan was asked if it was true that the decision to submit legislation was prompted by the outcry over the original decision No he replied because we went right ahead and I was having talks with senators about this
HOSTILITY MARKS VIEW ON JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/21/us/hostility-marks-view-on-judicial-precedents.html,In asserting Tuesday that there was no basis in law for denying tax exemptions to segregationist private schools President Reagan displayed a lack of deference to judicial precedent that has antecedents throughout American history but seems to be a particular hallmark of his Administration The judicial precedents including one that was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1971 all conclude that the tax laws do not permit the granting of tax exemptions to institutions that practice racial segregation Mr Reagans failure to take account of these precedents not only at Tuesdays news conference but in earlier comments was a variation on his Administrations pattern of questioning court decisions on such issues as abortion busing affirmative action quotas and the rights of criminal defendants In part this reflects a tension between the executive branch and the judiciary rooted in the constitutional separation of powers and which dates back to 1803 when Chief Justice John Marshall first struck down an act of Congress as unconstitutional It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is Chief Justice Marshall asserted assuming for the Federal courts a supremacy in interpreting the Constitution and ambiguous acts of Congress that some Presidents have sought to circumvent but none has directly defied Hostility Toward Judiciary The Reagan Administration says that the Supreme Court has not settled the tax exemption issue definitively and therefore that it is free to adopt its own interpretation of the law notwithstanding the contrary conclusions of lower Federal courts It has also used procedural devices to prevent the Supreme Court from settling the issue The tax exemption matter also reflects the Administrations hostility toward a judiciary that Attorney General William French Smith has accused of having made constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions into the legislative domain The reason for this hostility is that the most conservative President in modern times finds his political goals frustrated at many turns by the rulings of Federal courts that have in the past two decades prohibited statesponsored prayer in public schools ordered busing of children to desegregate schools declared that women have constitutional rights to have abortions upheld use of racial and sexual quotas to remedy past discrimination in employment struck down dozens of state death penalty laws and placed stringent procedural restraints on the police and prosecutors This hostility is mirrored by that of Mr Reagans allies on the right in Congress who have sought to strip the Supreme Court of power to decide cases involving busing abortion and school prayer The Administration has taken no position on the constitutionality of these proposals while expressing sympathy with their objectives Limited Jurisdiction Urged Attorney General Smith has blasted judicial activism on issues such as abortion and has proclaimed his intention not to seek remedies including busing that the Supreme Court has ruled are constitutionally required to desegregate schools And the Administration has energetically sought to prevent the courts from ruling on the legality of Administration actions by urging them to limit their jurisdiction and by seeking abolition of direct Federal financing of legal aid for the poor Although Presidents including Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln Franklin D Roosevelt and Richard M Nixon have assailed Supreme Court decisions that stood in the way of political goals no Administration in 40 years has matched Mr Reagans in the harshness of its attacks And none has been more reluctant to defer to Chief Justice Marshalls oftquoted assertion that it is the province of the judiciary to say what the law is On Tuesday for example Mr Reagan ignored five judicial decisions holding that the tax laws do not permit exe mp tions for racially discriminatory schools About the Internal Re venue Service he said Weve prevented the IRS from determining national social policy all by itself The reference was to his dec ision to revoke an 11yearold policy begun during the Nixon Ad ministration and uniformly upheld by the courts of denying ta x exemptions to schools that discriminate on the basis of race The Originator He said he was the originator of the decision to revoke the policy a move sought by Southern conservatives in Congress who support the private segregationist schools that have sprung up in the wake of courtordered desegregation of public schools Larry Speakes the White House deputy press secretary acknowledged today that Mr Reagan told Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan some weeks ago that he wanted a change in the policy under which the IRS has unilaterally denied taxexempt status to schools that discriminate Mr Speakes said the Treasury Secretary passed the Presidents comments along to the officials involved Other Administration officials had said that the policy had been recommended by Treasury and Justice officials at the urging of Senator Strom Thurmond and Deputy Attorney General Edward C Schmults over the objections of top IRS officials including Commissioner Roscoe L Egger Jr They said it had later been approved by the White House Treasury and Justice Department officials announced Jan 8 that the Administration would move to grant tax exemptions to more than 100 private schools whose exemptions had been revoked for racial discrimination by prior Administrations and to more schools that have never had exemptions They said the reason was that Congress not tax collectors should decide whether such institutions qualify for exemptions adding that the Administration had no plans to propose new legislation on the subject The announcement provoked a storm of criticism and charges that the Government was subsidizing racism from civil rights leaders and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress Four days later Mr Reagan asserted that he was not a racist and said he would ask Congress to outlaw tax exemptions for segregationist schools in effect to overturn his own new policy The Law of the Land Mr Reagan said Tuesday that his objective all along had been to get Congress to enact a law against tax exemptions for schools that practice discrimination so that for the first time that will be the law of the land Contrary to Mr Reagans statements the Supreme Court and every Federal appeals court that has considered the tax exemption issue has concluded that Congress has already outlawed tax exemptions for institutions that discriminate on the basis of race although it has not stated its intention in so many words The policy revoked by Mr Reagan was adopted by the Nixon Administration in 1970 after a lower Federal court ordered it to stop granting exemptions to segregated private schools in Mississippi The Supreme Court in 1971 summarily affirmed the lower courts ruling that the tax laws required denial of exemptions to such schools and that it might be be unconstitutional to grant exemptions Federal appeals courts have come to that conclusion in four other cases In three of the cases including two now before the Supreme Court appeals courts rejected lawsuits by private schools seeking tax exemptions and upheld the policy of denying exemptions to racially discriminatory institutions as mandated by the tax laws and civil rights laws In the fourth the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the right of a class of black parentsto sue the Go vernment to compel more vigorous enforcement of that policy which Mr Reagan said Tuesday had no basis in law Rather than ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its 1971 ruling the Administration urged it on Jan 8 to dismiss a pending case in which South Carolinas Bob Jones University and another racially discriminatory school are appealing denials of tax exemptions The ground given was that the Administration planned to grant the exemptions In another case the Administration asked the Court to rule that black parents have no standing to challenge decisions to grant tax exemptions to schools that do not admit blacks It implied in its brief that the courts may have no jurisdiction to determine the legality of executive branch decisions to grant such exemptions If the Court accepted this argument the Administration would be free to grant exemptions to private schools accused of racial discrimination without worrying about whether it was legal to do so or not

FOES OF ABORTION MEET WITH REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/us/foes-of-abortion-meet-with-reagan.html,On the ninth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion demonstrators marched here today to support a legislative campaign to reverse that ruling Antiabortion leaders met with President Reagan who reiterated his longstanding personal opposition to abortion But they said that the President had not promised to give the abortion issue a high priority or to use his political muscle to push an antiabortion bill through Congress We did not ask for that commitment nor did we get it said JC Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee The antiabortion leaders conceded that Mr Reagan was continuing to focus his attention on the economic matters that have dominated the first year of his Presidency In addition they said sharp divisions within the antiabortion camp itself were hindering efforts to gather support in the White House and on Capitol Hill It simply hasnt shaken down said Mr Willke Theres a lot of thinking a nd soulsearching and praying and division out there For all its problems the antiabortion movement seems stronger today than at any time since the Supreme Court handed down its landmark ruli ng in the case of Roe v Wade in 1973 This strength wasdemonstrated by the long line of marchers estimated by the local police at 25 000 who paraded past the White House waving antiabortion banners and chanting slogans such as Life life life Last month a Senate subcommittee approved a constitutional amendment that would invalidate the 1973 decision and the full Judiciary Committee will probably send it to the Senate floor sometime this spring Proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah the amendment would declare that the right to abortion is not protected by the Constitution as the Justices held in 1973 and would empower Congress and individual states to pass laws restricting abortions Those who favor abortion rights consider the Hatch amendment a very real threat in the words of Marguerite BeckRex spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League Accordingly the league announced today a 500000 advertising campaign aimed at generating public opposition to the Hatch bill and public support for candidates the league supports in next falls election Its really important for us to sound the alarm to call our supporters to arms said Miss BeckRex We know theres a prochoice majority out there but we have to get them involved Since the Supreme Court decision she added opponents of abortion have felt more intensely about the issue than many voters who favor legal abortion and as a result opponents have had a stronger effect on the political process The aim of the new advertising campaign is to convince lawmakers that they will pay a political price if they support restrictions on abortion 75 in Poll Oppose Amendment Exactly what the public thinks about abortion is a key element in this political struggle In an Associated PressNBC poll conducted this week 75 percent of those surveyed opposed an amendment such as Senator Hatchs that would give Congress the authority to prohibit abortions Only 19 percent favored such an amendment and 6 percent were not sure Legalized abortion fares best with the public when the abortion question is cast in legal terms as in this survey Miss BeckRex said in describing the new advertising campaign We tested many themes and we found that people dont like emotional appeals What they really feel is that this is a personal issue and they dont want governmen t to interfere The antiabortion side generally agrees that voters have a natural reluctance to support a constitutional amendment or any other intrusion into their personal affairs As a result their public appeals stress the moral implications of abortion not the legal issues A fullpage advertisement today in The Washington Post for instance showed a photograph of a dead fetus and the following caption She is one of thousands of babies aborted each year in the late months of pregnancy Contrary to various polls asserted Ed McAteer president of the Religious Roundtable we know that the majority of people in this country when confronted with what abortion really is are opposed to abortion People are truly conflicted added Joanne Howes legislative representative for Planned Parenthood No one wants to have an abortion but they dont want the law to control other peoples lives This conflict is reflected in the Senate where the vote is expected to be close According to a count by Miss Howes 30 to 40 lawmakers are firmly committed either for or against a constitutional amendment With twothirds of the Senate needed to pass an amendment the outcome rests with what Miss Howes calls the mushy middle of uncommitted votes One big question is whether the antiabortion forces can resolve their differences and agree on a common strategy For years these activists have favored an amendment that would simply ban virtually all abortions but they have gradually come to realize that such a ban has little chance of passage The Hatch proposal which gives Congress and the state legislatures more flexibility in setting specific guidelines is favored by a growing number of abortion foes But the Hatch bill is seen as a compromise and a sellout by some elements in the antiabortion forces Moreover Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina is competing with Senator Hatch for leadership of the antiabortion movement He favors his own bill which would simply define life as beginning at conception Senator Hatch views the Helms approach as unconstitutional but it would effectively overturn the Supreme Court decision without the complications involved in winning ratification of a constitutional amendment by the necessary number of states Mr Reagans commitment remains a question too Will he really twist arms like he did in the Awacs fight asked Miss Howes Or will he just make perfunctory remarks and meet with the leaders once a year That wont move too many Senators

'FROM GLAMOUR TO GRIT',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/weekinreview/from-glamour-to-grit.html,WASHINGTON HOW thin is the ice President Reagan is skating on That is the question being asked as he begins a second year in office anxious to continue cutting the influence of the Federal Government but to manage politics and economics in a way that avoids major manage politics and economics in a way that avoids major Republican losses in the 1982 elections Despite the frigid winter the ice is getting thinner His percent in national surveys Unemployment has reached record levels for an election year and three Americans in ten expect it to hit their families this year according to the New York TimesCBS News Poll Conservatives are nagging that he has become too much a pragmatist The Republican unity that formed a precondition of his 1981 successes is strained But that ice will still support him Those approval ratings are falling only gradually Three Americans in five say they think his economic program will eventually succeed an optimistic group that included half of those who feared unemployment in their family The Presidents ability to avoid political damage from his own errors like those that punctuated Tuesdays press conference seems as good as ever The Administration has seriously consulted at least friendly governors about the welfare changes he wants to propose and the Republicans like the extraparty conservatives are likely to find that they have nowhere else to go The Coming Tests The tests will start coming soon A State of the Union Message that will probably call for more major changes in Federalstate responsibilities is one test some embattled Republican governors say they have so far been given the responsibility they want but not the money to make it work The next budget itself will provide a tougher battleground as elections soon to come not elections past concentrate Congressional attentions and apprehensions The next set of bad unemployment figures also may seriously test the allegiance of his supporters Mr Reagan however loose his grip on employment statistics appears to have a firm appreciation of his tactical situation As he told one of first anniversary celebrations a dinnerdance for big Republican donors last week The days of sensational quick victories are mostly behind us Now we move from the glamour of initial commitment to the grit of the long haul Some of the grit in Administration gears is all but inevitable a result of problems postponed and bubbling to the surface In 1981 much was made of how Democratic defectors in the House got Mr Reagans bills passed They did but only because the Republicans stayed monolithic in their support of Mr Reagan Constituent pressures particularly in Northeastern and Middle Western areas hit by doubledigit unemployment may force some House Republicans off the reservation In the Senate hearings on the Voting Rights Act begin Wednesday to offer the first occasion for division on social issues abortion lurks not far behind Those items reflect the fact that Congress has agendas of its own too The Senate for example is committed to setting the fate of Senator Harrison A Williams of New Jersey early next month before it does anything else And already some leading House Republicans all of whom face elections in November are opposing deficitcutting excise taxes while Senate Republicans of whom only a fifth are up this fall generally back them But the uncertainty about just what it is Mr Reagan will seek in Tuesdays State of the Union Message and later makes specific legislative s trategymaking pointless right now leaders in both bodies agree In a politically divided Congress Mr Reagan at least gets to propo se the agenda though perhaps not to control it as much as last year In the most general way House Democrats such as Representativ e Thomas S Foley their whip talk of being ready to cooperate wit h the White House if only it will cooperate with them But they also hope the recession will enable them to pick off Northern Repu blicans on key votes Senate Republicans suspect that any effort to pass new excise taxes will be used by House Democrats as a vehicle to repeal the third year of the Reagan tax cut bill Some other pr oblems seem gratuitously selfinflicted Mr Reagans shuffling abo ut on tax deductibility for segregated private schools has displease d not only their supporters but also civil rights advocates It was also undeniably sloppy Following months of indecision on the Voting Rights Act it probably contributed to singledigit levels of black approval for the President Counting on Magnetism This is only the most dramatic example of how the Administration has neglected a task its advisers set for it a year ago  reaching out to voters who had been against Mr Reagan or only weakly committed to him The dropoff in Republican party allegiance that is beginning to appear after a postelection surge is most evident among voters 25 to 34 years old who Republicans counted on for the realignment they wanted to cement Will Republicans retain the 40 percent of United Automobile Workers that the unions leadership believed voted for Mr Reagan now that even more of them are out of work Against these problems Mr Reagan and his allies count on his own magnetism James A Baker 3d the Presidents chief of staff asserted that he has the greatest reservoir of good will toward him of any President since Dwight Eisenhower Robert M Teeter of Market Opinion Research in Detroit said Reagans all right His personal standing is a floor underneath questions about the economy Even Representative Thomas S Foley the House Democratic whip said he did not expect Congressmen to attack him much out of a combination of Mr Reagans personal appeal and their political care The polls can be read that way Time Magazine for example found last month that 85 percent of the public thought of him as likeable But in this area as in so many elements of public opinion about the Administration right now the answers conflict The Times CBS poll found that only 22 percent of the public thought Mr Reagan cared a great deal about the needs and problems of people like themselves Mr Carter four years earlier got 38 percent to say he did The 48 percent who said they were afraid he might get the nation into a war were at least a measure of serious unease Patrick H Caddell once Mr Carters polltaker thinks Mr Reagans personality is overrated as a longrun asset He cites the caring numbers as evidence of Mr Reagans complete inability to suggest any empathy or compassion He said the class lines created between the rich who liked Mr Reagan and the poor who did not were a serious risk a magnet of hostilit y Moreover he said failures on budget deficits and interest rate s could be as devastating for Republicans as high unemploym ent was for the Democrats in 1980 if a party failed in what its loyalists thought ofas the bare minimum of its principles it suf fered Mr Caddell thought Mr Reagans boasts of cutting inflat ion were less valuable than Republicans had hoped There is a sense on both sides that the next two or three months may prove critical Mr Reagan succeeded brilliantly in 1980 in making changes that would outlast even a string of failures this year But in 1981 he was succeeding Mr Carter This time he has a hard act to follow
"CONSERVATIVES AT PRINCETON GET NEW, TABLOID VOICE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/nyregion/conservatives-at-princeton-get-new-tabloid-voice.html,PRINCETON IT IS nearly a decade since campus liberals ended their outcry over the Vietnam War but the voice of political activism at Princeton University goes on This time the voice is that of a new student newspaper with a decidedly conservative tone Were part of a growing cons ervative movement at campuses across the nation said John Goodwin a Princeton senior and publisher of the tabloid Named The Madison Report it honors President James Madison Princeton Class of 1771 whose beliefs in limited government and a constructionist interpretation of the Constitution are said to go hand in hand with conservative philosophies today The first issue in December included an editorial opposing the use of endowment funds to pay for student abortions and an opinion piece supporting President Reagans serious workable economic policy A news article reported that the university in response to the newspapers inquiries was reconsidering whether the campus Womens Center could support an Equal Rights Amendment task force and still be eligible for university financing Many of the political theories which have dominated college campuses for the last 10 years have failed when put into practice another editorial said The Madison Report it announced will search for alternatives to the Kennedy liberalism that is still pervasive at Princeton and other Ivy League schools We want to bring conservatives out of the closet Mr Goodwin said The editor Roger Brooks a sophomore said six students had volunteered to join his staff of 18 after they had seen the first issue which was eight pages Mr Brooks said he planned to increase the size to 12 pages and to publish biweekly after the January examination and vacation period Articles will be divided about half and half between campus and national issues he said I think its very clear that there are a lot more conservative students at Princeton now than five years ago Mr Brooks said The professors are still heavily liberal but a lot of the students are beginning to question that Mr Goodwin said he had observed a similar split Theres always been a divergen ce between students and administrators he said In the past it seems like the students were perenially on the Left But now the tabl es have turned and it seems that the administration demonstrates en trenched liberalism while the students have a position on the Rig ht The first issue copies of which were given to all students and faculty members cost 600 to produce Mr Brooks reported He said that the outlay had been covered by a 2000 grant from the Wilbur Foundation in California a small kind of family foundation that supports academic undertakings and that he had learned about from a visiting professor from California In addition a dozen local merchants bought ads The papers editors say they plan to sell mail subscriptions to parents and alumni while continuing free distribution on campus In the long run were going to be financed by ads and subscriptions Mr Brooks said In the shorter run were looking for other grants because its hard to sell ads until youve put out issues and businesses know that youre a serious undertaking The upstart tabloid is already being taken seriously by the universitys centuryold newspaper The Daily Princetonian Im thrilled to see another publication coming out said Barton Gellman The Princetonians publisher Healthy competition gives you a sense of vigor Mr Goodwin said that poor representation of student views in The Princetonian was part of the motivation for his undertaking There is a liberal slant in their news articles The Madison Reports publisher charged adding I think students are pretty much fed up with their bias In response Mr Gellman acknowledged that its fair to describe our editorial policy as more often than not leftist or moderateleftist but he also maintained We really are scrupulously fair and try very hard to avoid injecting our opinions into news copy Mr Goodwin pointed to what he considered another symptom of the liberal orthodoxy at Princeton Speakers brought to the campus through college financing he said have been heavily weighted toward liberals and radicals To redress the balance of opinion The Madison Report will challenge campus liberal organizations Mr Goodwin asserted We are afraid that the Third World Center is actually harming interracial harmony by its excessive emphasis on black unity the papers first editorial suggested We also doubt that the Womens Center actually represents or helps most women on campus However Debbie Lewis head of the Equal Rights Amendment task force of the Womens Center feels that her group suffered unfairly from the new papers conservative lash Th eir art icle insinuates that the task force is using university fu nds and thats not true she said All the money used by the t ask force has been raised by the task force After perusing the papers first issue Miss Lewis gave this assessment A lot of it is so conservative that its almost funny Its unfortunate that some people really do believe these things A sampling of about 50 undergraduates in the library and Student Center showed some to be indifferent but most welcomed the paper Im a liberal but Im glad its here because its good to have as many different opinions as possible accessible to students said Clara Severiens a junior And Charles Monk a senior said You cant have too many newspapers Neither Mr Goodwin nor Mr Brooks plans to pursue journalism as a career Im more interested in government and this is an outlet Mr Brooks said Mr Goodwins other interests include running a sports program at a local elementary school and supervising athletics for the universitys Ivy Club the reputedly wealthy and conservative eating club of which he is a member After completing an independently designed major in Biotechnology and Science Policy Mr Goodwin hopes to go to Harvard Stanford or Chicago Business School and either before or after that Ill be going into the biological engineering field Mr Goodwin whose hometown is Mission Hills Kans was not drawn East by the universitys putative traditionalism It has that reputation he acknowledged but added Princeton is a very diverse community It can no longer be stamped as a conservative bastion like it was in the 50s when everyone here was the product of a middle or upperclass wasp family
BAR GROUP TO DEBATE LAW SCHOOL ISSUE AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/us/bar-group-to-debate-law-school-issue-again.html,As 2000 lawyers convening at the American Bar Associations midyear meeting here debate a potpourri of issues ranging from proposals to narrow the Freedom of Information Act to preventive detention of some criminal suspects awaiting trial the hottest center of controversy again appears to be a small Christian fundamentalist law school in Oklahoma The associations policymaking House of Delegates is scheduled to debate Monday whether to reverse its decision to allow accrediting of law schools that select students and faculty members on the basis of religious belief as does the one at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa The debate will focus on whether the universitys constitutional right to freedom of religion should override the bar associations general opposition to religious discrimination an issue that has divided some of the leading members of the bar and has produced passionate appeals to constitutional principle and American tradition by each side Last August the House of Delegates faced with a lawsuit brought by Oral Roberts University that threatened the associations dominant role in supervising the nations law schools voted 147 to 127 to modify its rules against religious discrimination The vote came after a preliminary injunction by Federal District Judge James B Moran of Chicago who said it would be unconstitutional for the bar association to penalize a religiously oriented law school for restricting admission to people who share its religious beliefs Most states refuse to allow graduates of law schools not accredited by the bar association to practice law The univers itys OW Coburn School of Law which subsequently won provisional a ccreditation requires students to sign a code of honor affir ming their Christian belief and commitment The law school debate is not however the preoccupation of most of the lawyers here They plan to attend seminars to hear speeches by Chief Justice Warren E Burger on Sunday and Attorney General William French Smith on Monday to see old friends and in some cases to hustle up a little business Among the more than 30 proposals to be debated by the 380member House of Delegates besides accrediting law schools that practice religious discrimination are these  A resolution to support legislation that would narrow the Freedom of Information Act making it harder for news organizations business competitors and others to obtain financial commercial and business information provided by companies to Federal agencies  A proposal by the associations Individual Rights and Responsibilities Section to endorse amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring racial sexual or religious discrimination by any private club that derives a substantial portion of its income from business sources Addressing another issue facing the legal profession and the nation David R Brink the bar associations president told the National Conference of Bar Presidents today that the assault on the power of the Federal courts by some conservatives in Congress posed a legislative threat to our nation that may lead to the most serious constitutional crisis since our great Civil War Mr Brink said the associations 290000 members should join as partners and companions in arms in opposing more than 30 bills before Congress that would strip the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts of power to order desegregation through busing and to decide cases involving abortion and prayer in publ ic schools In a speech Friday Mr Brinks predecessor William Reece Smith urged members to continue their battle against President Reagans effort to abolish direct Federal financing for legal aid to the poor and to increase their pro bono voluntary work to make up for cuts in the programs budget
ABORTION FOES AND DIOCESE SPLIT ON TACTICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/nyregion/abortion-foes-and-diocese-split-on-tactics.html,THE Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre has begun a new antiabortion campaign but some of the movements most dedicated Long Island activists are denouncing it as divisive and unprincipled The split between the activists and the diocese parallels the split nationally between such activists and the Conference of Catholic Bishops The local campaign in fact is being run in conformance with a directive of the bishops who voted not long ago to throw the moral and political force of the American Catholic Church behind efforts to pass the proposed Hatch amendment to the Constitution This is the amendment that would nullify the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and allow each state to pass its own abortion legislation Catholics attending mass at the Islands 129 parishes last Sunday were asked to sign cards indicating their support for the amendment and other antiabortion legislation The cards urged their elected representatives to do the same This is the most divisive tactic that anyone could promote said Charles Williamson chairman of the Long Island Coalition for Life which voted recently to oppose the amendment Once you give up your principles youre dead and that is what some of these people are doing he said referring to those who support the Hatch amendment Mr Williamson who said he had been an antiabortion activist since 1962 said that the only acceptable amendment was one that would extend the protection of the laws to unborn fetuses from the time of their conception Efforts to pass such an amendment have foundered in Congress in a debate about when life begins Recognizing this the bishops threw their support to the Hatch amendment and on Dec 12 the National Right to Life organization gave the amendment its support by a delegate vote of 3024 The movement is split nearly 5050 Mr Williamson said and the thing we have to impress upon the Congress is that the grass roots is opposed to Hatch Mr Williamson and others who share his views oppose the Hatch amendment calling for state legislation on abortion because they believe it would be very difficult to get all 50 states to outlaw abortion And even if only one permitted abortion they would still consider that unacceptable The Long Island Coalition for Life includes eight duespaying gr oups on the Island and in Queens Mr Williamson said The Island ha s long been a stronghold of antiabortion sentiment and is the homefo r example of the former Right to Life Presidential candidate El len McCormick The Right to Life Party has succeeded to the fourth li ne on the ballot surpassing the Liberals in New York State The Rev Paul Driscoll coordinator of antiabortion efforts for the Rockville Centre Diocese contended in an interview that Mr Williamson was part of a small minority of activists who opposed the Hatch amendment Ive been meeting with a great number of groups and 90 percent of them are supporting the efforts of the bishops in behalf of the Hatch amendment he said He added that the Long Island Coalition had refused to meet with him to allow him to explain the diocesan support for the measure Richard Doerflinger coordinator of prolife activities for the United States Catholic Conference the lay arm of the Bishops Conference said that there was concern that some antiabortionists would refuse to sign the cards He added however that counteracting this might be an increase in support from people who have opposed extending legal personhood to the unborn child Mr Doerflinger added that this was the first time that the Bishops Conference had come out in support of a particular amendment He said the names gathered from the cards which he said would eventually be distributed to parishes all over the country  would be used to compile lists of supporters who could be called upon to write or telephone members of Congress at critical times in the political life of the proposed amendment In the metropolitan area cards were also distributed at parishes within the Archdiocese of New York which includes Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island Westchester and some upstate counties These cards however were in an old format according to Audrey Kelly human life coordinator for the archdiocese and did not mention the Hatch amendme nt Once we have the cards the signers will be contacted and educated as to what is going on and be asked to write to Congress on the Hatch amendment because that is what is going through now Mrs Kelly said She insisted that the Hatch amendment represented only a first step and that once this was passed the movement would seek a second amendment legally defining the fetus as a human being protected by all the laws Linda Zumpano chairman of the Celebrate Life Committee on Long Island expressed a similar view We know that Hatch is not a solution to the entire problem she said but after Hatch is passed the issue wont be over We have many long years ahead of us before we will say weve got enough
"Stage View; TWO PARTS GIMMICKRY, ONE PART DISCRETION",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/theater/stage-view-two-parts-gimmickry-one-part-discretion.html,Sometimes I think discretion is the better part of playwriting In the first play on the new triple bill at the Circle Rep in Sheridan Square an overweight frump tries to hide behind a refrigerator door that does not conceal her while her daughter rips off a platinum wig strides to the edge of the stage apron and orders the house electrician to hit her with an amber spotlight In the third of the evenings adventures a waif who looks like a gnome and talks like a refugee from an animated cartoon becomes so frustrated by her failed attempts to seduce a shy boy that she leaps into a steamer trunk and pulls the lid down after her But in the evenings centerpiece John Bish ops Confluences nothing the least bit bizarre happens A fort yish fellow who is waiting for his girlfriend to join him in a c ity park stretches out in the sun for a snooze and is awakened by th e appearance of a bearded older chap in a wheelchair The two m en talk and the talk isthe play Whatever we get out of it is going to come from the words they exchange the things they make us see wi thout really budging an inch And Mr Bishops Confluences also being used as the overall title for the occasion is easily the nights champ In its reserve its eversopatient reliance on impl ication it becomes infinitely more vivid than its companionplay s that do things Oh Mr Bishops play does something all right it would scarcely belong on a stage if it didnt but it arrives at its irretrievable event so subtly so offhandedly with such easy grace that you scarcely notice the unannounced underground shock that will alter a couple of lives Jimmie Ray Weeks is the still sle nder but decidedly balding chap whos biding his time while the younger girl he lives with rehearses for a nearby summerstock engagement Hes spent some years playing pro ball he knew when to quit though and is now manufacturing advertising d isplays He recognizes the onelegged man paring an apple and sta ring at the point where three rivers join to flow less turbulently as one Edward Seamons bluntly philosophical cripple was once Hall of Fame stuff In fact Mr Weeks  then a boy of eight had seen hi m play his last game had even been near him when he made his last trip to the dugout Hed been riveted by the look in the retiring mans eyes all the hatred at physical failure all the envy of the k ids coming up And the resignation Do it quick and simple and le ave your laundry behind Mr Seamon sums up now The play gradually acquires a pattern there is an art it suggests in choosing the right time to get out But the pattern isnt billboarded even though billboarding is Mr Weekss business Its an interior one coming to life in words and space as the past is recalled and indelibly described The body remembers the muscles remember as Mr Seamon says and his summoning up of a ballpark in Pittsburgh or in Cleveland of a snowbank turning blue right here at the joining of rivers of how it felt to be someone other than the castoff you are now is unfailingly graphic Mr Weeks too makes you believe in the onetime existence of a precisely shaped shadow he saw the shadow of the stadium inching across the infield during a late September afternoon Mr Bishops words become eyes to see with and  eventually  to make meanings of in this gently conceived handsomely written facing up to the farewells life regularly imposes Beth Henleys Am I Blue an early work 1972 by the author of Crimes of the Heart has been used to top off the Circle Rep evening probably because it is a comedy and comes equipped with a good bit of manic energy Looked at in perspective and taken for the collegiate exercise it is the broad buzzing bittersweet piece makes its announcement plain as plain can be Miss Henley is talented Miss Henley is going to become a playwright Indeed the shape of the nearcartoon and the shifts from gaudy extravagance to sobering sentiment are in surprisingly firm hands If Id only managed to believe that Miss Henleys dwarflike girl and gangling boy would actually spend an entire evening not to say night together Id be happy to do several backflips for you I didnt exactly believe I kept thinking that fellow would have the good sense to git the play is of the Southern school much much sooner But if we pass that I must say I became more rather than less interested in the tatterdemalion reject that June Stein plays so well as the giddy nonsense gallops on Miss Stein picks up an 18yearold college loner in a bar by snatching his raincoat and putting it over her head He is getting himself drunk as he frequently points out and he is in possession of a visiting card to the local whorehouse His fraternity brothers have given him the card as a comingofage present in case he ever does come of age The girl whose permanent talkingjag exactly complements his prolonged and slightly dazed silences entices him back to the rattrap she calls her apartment a litter of stuffed animals bundled newspapers pneumatic floor cushions and fringed lampshades leaves room for no more than two beds and a large box of breakfast cereal Fearful of losing the lads interest Jeff McCracken is reasonably appealing in a part that is clearly going to leave him speechless Miss Stein who seems about two inches high and navigates the place like a hummingbird urgently makes paper hats with her teeth puts Slinkies I believe those coiledwire things are called Slinkies on top of her massed curls so that she looks like a deranged Betsey Trotwood seems to eat her own necklace from time to time and puts pins into voodoo dolls with such ferocity that I found myself wincing some five rows away The actress also handles a telephone call from her drunken father a call that leaves her quietly weeping most efficiently As with Crimes of the Heart I found myself digging in my heels at certain of the authors comic extravagances Here after Miss Stein has offered the boy sex and been told that she might become pregnantshe pops back with Pregnant I could go to Tokyo for an abortion Ive never been to the Orient That last se ntence doesnt belong toa genuine character not even this addled one  its a tagon gag andshould be resisted But overall you can see that even when Miss Henley was first writing about crazies at Sou thern Methodist U the makings were there Theyre still there they just want a little morehumanizing Under no circumstances could anyone call Lanford Wilsons Thymus Vulgaris which opens the threehour bill discreet Now that he is recognized as one of our most effective contemporary dramatists Mr Wilson is no doubt entitled to his bouts of idle playfulness But playfulness is one thing the apparent loss of all sense of purpose and proportion is quite another Thymus Vulgaris written just recently is a joke that isnt on anything Unless it is on the kind of candid acknowledgement of theatrical contrivance that made such a charming opening for Talleys Folly I n t he latter case calling attention to the stages unreality had a point Talleys Folly was incurably happily romantic Hav ing Judd Hirsch advise the audience in advance that the moonshine was nt real gave the mood some complexity we were cautioned not to suppose that the pretty glimmer on the water told the whole sto ry Here however the technique is overelaborated and then left wit hout function The whore in platinum curls and bridal gauze who comes to visit her slatternly mother while an offstage tape plays Gershwin promptly turns front and calls to the rear of the auditorium Could we lose the music Mama when she stops hiding and begins talking stares at the audience and announces she is afraid of it When a highway patrolman in boots and dark glasses turns up he is stunned by the faces out front so much so that he must leave to rehearse himself before reappearing Reappearing he is assured by mama that we dont want to blow your big scene Not long after the daughter calls for the amber spot mentioned earlier and sits on the forestage to soliloquize Unhappily this is gimmickry for its own sake random unapplied tedious We do try hard to follow what may be a story is there really a man waiting to marry the daughter and if there is does the girl think marriage worth it But were not only denied an answer were denied any interim emotional substance now The three figures on stage are only costumesizes not characters And when the daughter muses aloud I feel like an untapped person we can only and most heartily agree This time Mr Wilson has no real illusion going for him which of course means that his disillusioning tactics have nothing to work on Circle Rep has done all three pieces carefully Inasmuch as their respective authors are all writers of promise andor accomplishment the session as a whole should be worth it to the truly curious  most especially to those curious about the progress of Mr Bishop The Trip Back Down Besides the cookies on sale at intermission are excellent
"FEINT, THRUST AND PARRY IS PAPANDREOU'S STYLE SO FAR",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/weekinreview/feint-thrust-and-parry-is-papandreous-style-so-far.html,A political consensus relatively unusual in Greece seems to have emerged about the first 100 days of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreous Government It has abandoned many radical plans and retreated to Western Europeanstyle Social Democratic government behind a screen of Socialist rhetoric Although Mr Papandreou has repeatedly stepped on Northern European and American toes he has backed off from threats to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Common Market At home Mr Papandreou has consoled leftwing supporters with social and political reforms while leaving business interests relatively unscathed Conservative opponents were quick to criticize what former Defense Minister Evangelos Averoff called the Governments contradictory policies on critical domestic and foreign issues and its inability to fulfill its preelection promises Accusing Mr Papandreou of having perfected the tactic of glorifying retreat Constantine Mitsotakis a former Foreign Minister said that Papandreou is occasionally compelled to play the lion to give the impression of fulfilling his previous foreign policy threats but in effect he changes nothing Playing the lion has included refusal to join in NATO warnings of sanctions to punish Soviet involvement in Poland embracing Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and opening a Greek embassy in Havana Government officials said they were demonstrating discontent with American handling of Greek foreign policy interests particularly Cyprus and other disputes with neighboring Turkey a fellow NATO member They hope these tactics will win concessions in negotiations this winter on the fate of United States bases in Greece Athens wants a new defense and economic agreement that will establish a balance of military power with Turkey and include safeguards against Greek fears of attack by Ankara The agreement Athens officials say would enable them to increase spending on ambitious social welfare programs In another controversial move Greece last week agreed to resume servicing Soviet naval supply vessels When the previous Conservative Government inaugurated this service in 1979 Washington pointedly reminded Athens of its NATO obligations ultimately Soviet naval customers were turned away Last week the State Department expressed its regret particularly at this time at the Greek decision adding that it detracts from the security of the region Mr Papandreous nationally proud and independent foreign policy has silenced leftwing critics in his party and in the proMoscow Greek Communist Party It has also helped divert attention from the Governments domestic economic program which has disappointed many leftwingers Indeed the Socialists have provided generous increases for workers and pensioners in the lowerincome brackets as well as indexpegged wages and th e 40hour week But there have also been incentives and reassuran ces for businessmen to encourage investments Threats of nationaliza tion and socialization have not materialized priv ate enterprise remains the backbone of the economy On the social front the Government has moved swiftly It has started action to lower the voting age to 18 abolish capital punishment improve prison conditions legalize abortion promote equality of the sexes and establish civil marriage At a stormy protest meeting last week the countrys Greek Orthodox hierarchy denounced civil marriage as prostitution and adultery and warning that couples married outside the church would automatically remove themselves from its rolls The Government has also stirred old political embers by granting recognition to the Communistled antiNazi resistance of World War II by abolishing official commemoration of rightist vic tories in the194649 civil war and by accelerating the return of nearly 40000 Greeks who fl ed to Eastern Europe after the Communist defeat in 1949Mr Papandreo us critics argue that such measures are largely psychological and costfree and are alternatives to farreaching social change  The Government has drawn sharper partisan criticism for its extensive purges of the civil service statecontrolled radio and television networks and the labor movement Conservatives have warned that such moves and the staffing of state machinery with Socialist Party stalwarts are designed ultimately to establish a oneparty state But many Greeks recall that the Conservatives often did much the same or worse during their seven years in power Regardless of disappointments during its early months the Socialist Government appears securely in place for the remaining four years of its term Mr Papandreou has won the cooperation of the military by changing the leadership granting generous economic benefits to officers and by foreign policy chauvinism Discontent in the church is discounted and the Conservative and Communist opposition in Parliament have relatively few seats President Constantine Caramanlis the Conservative leader who restored civilian government in Greece in 1974 after seven years of military rule retains substantial powers under the Constitution But as yet Mr Caramanlis has not found reason to intervene in the political process
A LOOK AT THE MORAL MAJORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/24/nyregion/a-look-at-the-moral-majority.html,WHEN first setting eyes on the Thomas Road Baptist Church the Lynchburg Va home of the controversial Rev Jerry Falwell and headquarters of the Moral Majority an outoftowner cannot help but be impressed Sitting astride the crest of one of the citys numerous hills the massive edifice with its glistening white c o lumns and spire seems to tower in lofty majesty above its merely mo rtal surroundings I first went to Lynchburg in 1976 as a student attending tiny Lynchburg College There on the eve of his leap into national prominence I learned of Mr Falwell and his peculiar brand of rightwing video religion Later after I moved off campus to a house just a Bibles thump away from Mr Falwells I began to take a very real interest in the national phenomenon that my new neighbor had become As a neighbor a college student and a transplanted New Jerseyan with a healthy reserve of that breeds renowned cynicism I feel that I am in a unique position to make some observations on Mr Falwell and his moral minions One of the first things that I noticed about Mr Falwell was his ability to reduce me to either hysterical laughter or stuttering disbelief This is generally my reaction when I hear someone cite Bible passages as specific proof that God advocates the building of the B1 bomber and that any and all who do not agree will spend eternity in Hell repenting their lack of patriotism On a somewhat more mundane level was the time on Mr Falwells nationally televised Old Time Gospel Hour when he gave a sermon that was nothing more than a pitch for money so that a friend could buy a mobile home and spend his retirement traveling around the country Im not sure that Jesus God or even religion in general were ever mentioned although the sermons subject was charity of a sort Mr Falwells celebrated attack on Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution which gained favor with such wellknown scientific authorities as Ronald Reagan was especially interesting to me as a member of the student community Biology not being my favorite subject I welcomed Mr Falwells Creationist crusade After all Creationism is a lot easier to understand than evolution and you only have to buy one textbook Spending as much time as I did in Lynchburg I was bound to run across a number of members of Mr Falwells congregation as well as other students attending his own Liberty Baptist College They were in general a very friendly sort whose main characteristic seemed to be that they spent more time smiling than thinking Liberty Baptist College by the way is the only institution of higher learning I know of that is surrounded by a chainlink and barbedwire fence and whose only road into campus is guarded by armed sentries Hardly what I would call the ideal academic environment Perhaps my most vivid personal memory of Mr Falwells army was on one of those Wednesday nights when I got caught in the human traffic jam that always accompanies the end of his midweek sermon Pouring out of the front door of the church and onto Thomas Road was a tidal wave of Christian soldiers Anyone who has ever seen the movie The Swarm  in which billions of mutant bees attack a town covering buil dings cars people pets and everything else in sight should have n o trouble picturing the scene The churchgoers making their way to the parking lots across the street would simply bound onto the avenue ahead of moving vehicles secure in the knowledge that God was looking out for them This was after all Thomas Road Their road Gods highway As a veteran of these circumstances I had long since given up being angry at finding myself trapped by this mob virtually within sight of my house Blowing the cars horn elicited either ubiquitous smiles turned in my direction or a wave from one of the many pretty blonde girls as if my angry action was some sort of salutation The only thing to do while waiting for the flood to recede was to roll down the car windows and turn up the volume on the tape deck blaring the latest from Bruce Springsteen in the hope of offending anyone in the crowd who was still capable of being offended I stopped laughing at these people when I realized just how many of them were willing to stop thinking for themselves and let Jerry Falwell do it for them It seemed incredible to me that that many people nodded their heads and shouted Amen whenever Mr Falwell put the blame for everything  from teenage pregnancies to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan  on rock n roll or some equally unlikely cause I turned downright hostile toward the Moral Majority I no longer saw it as a benign sideshow in the best Elmer Gantry tradition but rather as the greatest threat to personal freedom and liberal ideals that this country had seen since Joe McCarthy I overreacted From the perspective that being back in New Jersey gives me I have come to realize that no one in Lynchburg could ever make a clear and objective judgment of Mr Falwell and his movement They are simply too close and their actions too personal Reflecting from a distance of 300 miles has led me to realize just where the Moral Majority came from and why it will neve r be the success or threat that people think Mr Falwell and his Moral Majority were simply quicker than most to realize that this country was heading back to the Right on one of its periodic fluctuations between ultraliberalism and ultraconservatism Mr Falwell happened to jump on the pendulum at the right moment he certainly did not start it moving nor have much affect on its course beyond speeding it along a little The antiwar movement student radicalism and liberal reforms of the 1960s marked the pendulums most leftward arc The recessions and gasoline crises of the 70s were signs that things would be swinging back to the Right very soon Americas general disgust with Jimmy Carters incompetence its frustration with Iran and a newfound belligerence once Vietnam was far enough in the past to be forgotten by most people all culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan The pendulum had swung back Jerry Falwell simply had a good seat up front But he wasnt driving he was just along for the ride The Moral Majority provided a convenient umbrella under which huddled all manner of fringe groups from the most virulent John Birchers to the most righteous antiabortionists Attacks on the Moral Majority by liberals served only to strengthen its hand The best thing that Mr Falwells opponents can do is to lie low and give him enough rope for he surely will hang himself His ridiculous oratory and rigid moral positions will see to that The media always on the lookout for the colorful in an election year provided Mr Falwell with coverage far out of proportion to his actual importance This of course encouraged him to do things like claim responsibility for the Reagan landslide victory a notion that is clearly nonsense The vast majority of Americans are middleoftheroaders Just as they have rejected extremism in the pursuit of liberty they are bound to reject extremism in the pursuit of morality Any hope that Mr Falwell ever had of gaining a solid national base lay in cultivating this majority of moderate middleclass Christians He never had a chance Mr Falwell is now and always will be a regional phenomenon Hes just one more Bible bully in an area of the country where they are a tradition A recent poll in Virginia indicated that he may actually be the most unpopular public figure in his own home state This is not to say that there is no shred of legitimacy in some of the Moral Majoritys positions Their arguments against abortion although rather narrowminded and blind to some of the wider repercussions do form a legitimate basis for discussion They may be right and they may be wrong but it is proper to arguethe case in a religious context However wh en they start to claim divine inspiration for a new armsrace censors hip or the right to threaten any liberal politicians with eternal damnation  to say nothing of defeat at the polls  theyhave stepped somewhat beyond the bounds for a group of selfproclaime d moralists The great majority of Americans have always shown an admirable ability to see through a sham You cant fool all of the people all of the time is as true now as ever The wider the exposure that Mr Falwell and the tactics employed by his Moral Majority receive the more likely he is to alienate whatever national support he ever had So with all that off my chest I think Ill just sit back have a beer thumb through the latest Playboy and stop worrying about the Moral Majority They never have been and never will be as moral or as much of a majority as they think
AVOIDABLE BIRTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/25/opinion/avoidable-births.html,I was reared a Roman Catholic and I am intimately familiar with the religious doctrine that preaches protection for the fetus regardless of consequences for woman or child I have seen its impact on families and women I have been employed in the social and health field in New York City since 1947 and know the lengths women will go to avoid bearing a child they cannot care for I know the consequences of illegal clandestine abortion and of compulsory childbearing That experience compels me to oppose Senator Orrin Hatchs Human Life Federalism Amendment along with the other proposed amendments because they will remove constitutional protection of women and make abortion subject to the vagari es of state legislaturesand the Congress Prior to 1970 6500 women each year were admitted to public hospitals in New York City for incomplete or botched abortions About 25 woman a year died Thousands of children were born to parents unable and often unwilling to care for them Many white youngsters found adoptive homes but black babies and infants with medical problems were forced into institutions Childbearing among teens was at a record level and hundreds of children of teen parents died in infancy But in 1970 in New York and around the same time in a large number of other states those realities changed Abortion was made legal and safe The record of the past 10 years shows that legal abortion virtually eliminates death and complications from abortion that babies who are born are healthier that fewer teens become parents It demonstrates that there has been a dramatic decline in infant and maternal mortality Vast sums have been saved in public expenditures for welfare and related services One of the most striking corollaries of legal abortion has been the increased use of contraception throughout the state Of the 40000 patients served annually by Planned Parenthood of New York City about 10000 use abortion services Some are very young women  a few as young as 12 pregnant because of ignorance Others are women in their late 30s and 40s too old in their judgment to safely and capably bear children Most of our abortion patients have assiduously practiced family planning and failed Or they have abandoned their method  the pill or the IUD  out of fear of complications The underlying message of the past 10 years is a message of determination  the determination that they will bear only those children that they can care for love support and nurture A new value on childbearing is starting to emerge For the first time for rich and poor alike its possible for birth to be a considered a deliberate action with the value placed on each child as an individual Increasingly children are not thought of as property or mere working hands for the family They are not just seen as parents social security not as punishment for sex or the penalty for being a woman and not just as a random accident Each child is now seen as a new unique member of the human family Overwhelmingly people prefer to prevent pregnancy Ninety percent of American women at risk of unwanted pregnancy are taking serious steps to avoid it But our most effective method the oral contraceptive is distrusted by many women Only onethird of Planned Parenthood of New Yorks clients now choose the pill compared to 75 percent a half dozen years ago For young women under 25 who intend to have children later in life many physicians will not prescribe the intrauterine device because of serious concern about infection and consequent sterility Seventeen out of every 100 diaphragm users get pregnant in the first year using that method Among Planned Parenthood of New Yorks own patients more than 10 percent of diaphragm users fail to prevent pregnancy Up to 10 percent of condom users also experience failure and 15 percent to 25 percent of the users of natural family planning methods report failures There are 585 million women between the ages of 15 and 50 in this country Most are at risk of pregnancy for some time every year The youngest among them face 25 to 35 years of avoiding pregnancy  300 to 400 monthl y challenges  so that they can become pregnant the onetwo or three times during their lives when they want to bear a child Based on statistics one can predict that virtually every American woma n turning 15 this year will have at least one unwanted pregnancy bef ore menopause I urge the Senate to respond to the demonstrated desire of men and women to avoid unwanted unintended childbearing by enabling them to prevent pregnancy more successfully rather than by trying to outlaw abortion The proposals before the Senate will not stop abortion They will simply drive it underground

BAR URGED TO JOIN FIGHT ON POLITICS IN THE COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/us/bar-urged-to-join-fight-on-politics-in-the-courts.html,Attorney General William French Smith today asked several hundred lawyers to join him in urging the courts to stop political policymaking which he said undermines popular support for our legal system and threatens the legal profession as well as the courts In a speech assailing what he called journalistic confusion and mischaracterizations of my previous remarks on judicial restraint Mr Smith said that his repeated criticisms in recent months of judicial activism on such issues as abortion busing and affirmative action were a matter not of politics but of constitutional principle The courts themselves engage in politics if they exceed their constitutional role and intrude upon the policymaking responsibilities of the political branches Mr Smith told the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association which is convening here The promotion of judicial restraint is thus an effort to secure the independence of the judiciary not undermine it he said adding that judicial activism had aggravated the historic suspicion toward the legal profession Overstepping Authority Mr Smith said that now as at previous times in American history to which he referred the Federal courts have overstepped their constitutional authority and removed questions of policy from resolutions by the political branches Invariably bad policy has resulted he said as have ser iousattacks on th e independence and legitimacy of the courts by people who see major ity rule being thwarted by the legal system itself Mr Smith made no mention however of a push by conservatives in Congress to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction to decide cases involving desegregation through busing abortion and school prayer Many association leaders view this push as the most serious attack on the independence of the Federal courts in decades Mr Smith implied today that political court decisions on such issues posed what he called grave dangers to the Federal courts by inviting political attacks on them But he has repeatedly refused to say whether he thinks legislati ve efforts to strip the courts of their jurisdiction over constitutional issues were a constitutional or desirable response to what he called judic ial usurpation of the popular authority that the Constitution can f ind in the elected branches Critical of Reporting Mr Smith sprinkled his speech with barbs about inaccurate reporting of his actions as Attorney General and with more oblique criticisms of the role of lawyers in promoting judicial activism I can personally attest Mr Smith said to the accuracy of what is called Knolls Law of Media Accuracy Everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true except for the rare story of which you happen to have firsthand knowledge  The inclination of lawyers as a group to turn every social issue into a legal question requiring judicial resolution can only exacerbate the publics suspicion of the legal profession he said at one point At the same time he said that our adversary system is one of the finest developments in legal history Mr Smiths speech today was the third since October criticizing judicial activism which President Reagan has also assailed especially in the case of Supreme Court constitutional rulings that conflict with the Administrations opposition to abortion and desegregation through busing and which frustrate other political objectives of the Administration Groundswell of Conservatism Mr Smith said today that he had been unfairly criticized in the American Bar Association Journal and elsewhere for seeking to politicize the courts after a speech in October in which he had suggested that the courts should heed the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election He said he opposed judicial activism by conservative as well as by liberal judges noting that conservative Supreme Court Justices who struck down New Deal social legislation ultimately provoked the courtpacking assault upon the nine old men of the Supreme Court by President Roosevelt in 1937

no question I would stop smoking said Milton Eldridge a cabdriver who has chainsmoked while driving through Washingtons streets for the last 40 years What about the health warning that appears on every pack of cigarettes I dont pay attention to it and Im not sure it is meant for me he said Mr Eldridges remarks encapsulate the reasons why the Federal Trade Commission reported last year that the warning is ineffective and why several Congressmen recently introduced legislation to make the message more explicit But Mr Eldridges remarks also echo the tobacco industrys argument that smokers know the hazards involved and take the risk anyway For example the Tobacco Institute which represents the major manufacturers contends that the 10yearold warning has alerted virtually everyone about what it terms the smoking and health controversy The industrys position is that there is no proof that smoking causes any disease and that there are only statistical associations linking smoking and a variety of illnesses including seven types of cancer heart dise ase emphysemachronic bronchitis miscarriages stillbirths  birth defects and reduced birth weights But after a fiveyear investigation of cigarette advertising practices and consumer behavior as reflected in many national polls the Federal agency charged by Congress to review cigarette advertising concluded in its report last year that people did know in a general sort of way that smoking is not a good idea But according to the polls people did not know what are reported as the grim specifics  24 percent of heavy smokers did not know that smoking is dangerous  40 percent did not know that smoking causes most cases of lung cancer  60 percent did not know that smoking causes most cases of emphysema  50 percent did not know that smoking causes many heart attacks  50 percent of teenagers did not know that smoking is addictive  41 percent of smokers did not know that smoking will shorten their expected lifespan The Tobacco Institute disputes the commissions interpretation of the polls contending among other things that a respondent who says he does not believe smoking causes premature death is not ignorant of the allegations that it does But the commission report concluded that after nearly a decade the current warning has been overexposed and has simply worn out Fewer than 3 percent of adults ever read the warning and the warning is often implicitly contradicted by the advertisements themselves it says Advertisements it adds are frequently filled with rugged vigorous attractive healthylooking people living energetic lives full of success and athletic achieve ment free from any health hazards Last month legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress that closely follows the Federal Trade Commissions recommendation to replace the general warning on cigarette packages and advertising with six specific cautions about lung cancer emphysema birth defects and heart disease One warning at a time would be displayed and then rotated every three months in a continuous cycle with the other warnings A consumer lobbying organization the Health Research Group has also recommended that a skull and crossbones be added to the warnings Although the tobacco lobby has powerful allies in Congress Representative Henry A Waxman a Democrat from California and the sponsor of one bill believes the measure may be approved I understand the Administration is going to support the bill he said adding that the Government health and social programs bear several billion dollars of the cost of treating smokingrelated diseases This week Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services appeared to lend his influence to the cause by saying in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission that he was committed to effective action to reduce cigaretterelated disease and death But neither legislative proposal addresses the content of the cigarette advertising which the commission report said often undermines the warnings usefulness One cigarette advertisment noted in the report suggests that smoking is part of growing up When your taste grows up says a young lumberjack Winston outtastes them all Robert Weymueller director of government relations at the American Lung Association said The biggest concern to us are the smokers who arent there yet the teenagers who are experimenting Although smoking has declined sharply among adult men and declined slightly among adult women more teenagers especially girls are smoking today than ever Mr Weymueller said Antismoking programs used to be geared to high school students but now the association has developed a curriculum for kindergarten children he added The Tobacco Institute in its rebuttal to the commissions report contends that cigarette advertising is solely designed to sell a particular brand of cigarette to smokers not to convince nonsmokers to take up smoking These warnings have been proposed in bills pending in Congress for cigarette packages and advertising they would be used individually in threemonth rotation periods Warning Cigarette smoking is a major cause of heart disease For information on the specific dangers of cigarette smoking write to the Surgeon General United States Public Health Service Washington DC 20201 Warning Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of emphysema and lung cancer Smokers No matter how long you have smoked quitting now greatly reduces the risks to your health Warning Cigarette smoking by pregnant women may result in birth defects or spontaneous abortion Warning Cigarette smoking may cause d eath from heart disease cancer or emphysema Warning The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking by pregnant women may result in miscarriage premature births or child weight deficiencies

NEW ENTHUSIASM SURPRISES FEMINISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/31/nyregion/new-enthusiasm-surprises-feminists.html,WOMEN in Connecticut are signing up in large numbers to work for what has become a lastditch effort to save the proposed equal rights amendment Whether organizing the ERASupport rally set for a few weeks from now in Old Greenwich taking part in the doortodoor canvass currently under way in New Haven adding thei r names to a supporters list being compiled on weekends i n the Westf ar ms shopping mall in Farmington or volunteering to go into the unratifiedstates as missionaries their enthusiasm has taken man y feminist leaders by surprise The surge of interest seems to be the result of what many see as a backsliding on womens rights in the last year as well as rising opposition to the equal rights amendment in the wake of a more general political shift to the right Weve only got until the end of June and so they see that time is running out said Greer T Bialy state coordinator for the National Organization for Women which has seen its Connecticut membership rise from 2700 to 3500 in the last year Women also seem worried that we may be losing some of the gains we made in the past suggested Claire Safran president of the newly formed midFairfield chapter of NOW These she said include a relaxation of regulations governing affirmative action new challenges to abortion rights and what she described as a general attitude against the equal rights amendment in the Reagan Administration They see that laws that get passed can too easily be erased she said So they realize that only if we are equal in the Constitution are we truly protected Expecting only 30 women to attend the inaugural meeting of the chapter in November she noted that more than 100 showed up Most local chapters of the major womens organizations such as the National Organization for Women the League of Women Voters and the American Association of University Women report outpourings of offers of time and money not only from their regular members but from women who were never affiliated with any group before Leaders explain that in the past there had been a certain level of apathy in Connecticut concerning the equal rights amendment because Connecticut ratified it back in 1973 and also amended the State Constitution to provide full equality for women in 1974 Thus there was less of a sense of urgency and need to become personally involved they said But lately they said news from other areas of the country indicating increased opposition to the amendment has galvanized many local women into action They have been hearing a lot of disturbing stories from other states said Deanna Lyons president of the 2200member state division of the American Association of University Women Support say the leaders has come from virtually every age group and economic circumstance Offers of help have been received said Mrs Bialy from older women in the suburbs concerned for their daughters younger professional women realizing the need to protect their recent gains and even students concerned about their future careers Such concern among executive women in Fairfield County many of whom had never been involved in activities on behalf of the amendment became the force behind the forthcoming rally sponsored by a coalition of 17 local womens groups The rally is to be at the Greenwich Civic Center on Feb 21 and will feature Betty Friedan as the keynote speaker Like many of us I realize that I had been personally occupied building my own career said Patricia Eller pastpresident of Women in Management who was one of the individuals who conceived of the rally We benefited from the work done by the early feminists Many of us owed our positions to their efforts It was time to do something in return The coalition organizing the Greenwich rally found that women calling in for tickets would ask if there was anything else they could do to help JoAnn Sullivan a 39yearold corporate insurance executive in Danbury said she was offering to help because she was responding to a fear that the traditional prejudices she said she used to meet in the workplace could quickly become acceptable once again She was especially worried that this might happen if the equal rights amendment did not go through and other equalopportunity laws followed suit I remember the old days said Miss Sullivan who has been in business for 20 years and who said she had never joined a group before We would always be told that the men needed the raises instead of us because they had wives and children to support It didnt matter that we were all doing the same work And that could quickly happen again because I think theres still a lot of prejudice under the surface Many men would love to see the women back in the home This outpouring of support has permitted the Connecticut League of Women Voters for instance to collect 5300 signatures in the last six months toward their national petition drive favoring the equal rights amendment They have also found that they are now receiving constant donations from the rank and file of their membership said Gene Bennion a state board member with the League of Women Voters The Danbury chapter of NOW has been able to send nine  mi ssionaries  to work in and for the unratified states One went to Utah two to Virginia two to Florida and four to the NOW headquarters in Washington The new midFairfield chapter of NOW has sent four more one to Oklahoma and three to Florida They also got an enthusiastic response from the actress Joanne Woodward a Westportresident who a greed to be the host at a wineandcheese fundraisingbenefit to be h eld in March Three weeks ago the Greater Hartford chapter of NOW won a court fight to be permitted to set up a desk in the Westfarms shopping mall in Farmington at which interested women could sign petitions or offer their names as helpers The various local chapters of the American Association of University Women have been busy selling notepaper illustrated with sketches of notable women as well as holding their own individual fundraising functions Lynn Taborsak a state leader of NOW said she had a surprisingly easy time gaining assistance for a special 17town fundraising drive started last weekend which plans to raise 30000 towards NOWs national media campaign Potential donors in these communities she said have been invited to meetings in private homes Everyone seems to feel the urgency of the time limitation she said They suddenly seem alarmed that something so basic could actually be rejected Or as Charlotte W Hoffman a publicrelations executive from Norwalk explained Even if we are shot down I want to be able to say I tried I wrote that check I joined the group I went to a meeting I made that phone call I dont want to just read about defeat in the paper and know I did nothing about it

THE RIGHT MEDICINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/31/books/the-right-medicine.html,A THEORY OF MEDICAL ETHICS By Robert M Veatch 387 pp New York Basic Books 2095 IN the spri ng of 1972 with American campuses still feeling the aftershocks o f demonstrations against the atrocities in Vietnam another smaller protest went almost unremarked A substantial numberof the graduating class of Harvard Medical School refused to take the Oath of Hippocrates that ancient affirmation full of apparentlynoble commitments which is at once the physicians promise to be good and the traditional solemn and ultimate rite of passage into the professio nal fold You do solemnly swear each man by whatever he holds most sacred that you will be loyal to the profession of medicine and just and generous to its members The new doctors explained their action in various ways The oath they said was arrogant and elitist Nowhere did it mention the rights of patients Nowhere did it acknowledge responsibilities to society Nowhere did it deal with issues of justice equity liberty or autonomy It happened that the commencement speaker that year was the wise and distinguished psychoanalyst Erik Erikson who responded warmly to the dissenting students An oath he said might testify to a fine old tradition and still be inadequate to helping doctors deal with the social and ethical tasks they daily face the squalor of poverty the corrupting influences of wealth and power the senselessness of accident the tyranny of pain the rage of disability and the finite impersonality of death An oath might impose a discipline of ethics he added but to be ethical means to know why one affirms a set of values A decade later Robert M Veatch returns to some of these issues in A Theory of Medical Ethics Whose ethics are they anyway Who shall decide what choices are right or wrong in the sphere of medicine How can a single system of medical ethics be applied to the broadest range of problems  not just abortion euthanasia transplants or psychosurgery but also the allocation of scarce medical resources the distribution of medical care or the risks and benefits of new technologies Above all what should be the philosophical and social roots of medical ethics And why should we affirm a particular set of values in medical matters Its not that we havent all thought and talked about these problems in the past 10 years During that time the unresolved conflicts of bioethics have entered the awareness of doctors professional societies the courts the legislatures the churches  and the public at every level Tot Pleads Dont Turn Off My Mommys Life Machine the tabloids frontpage headline reads Almost every medical school offers a course in bioethics Almost every teaching hospital has regular bioethics rounds on which interns and residents can discuss current problems and cases New journals casebooks commissions conferences and court decisions abound Dr Veatch himself  first at ColumbiaUniversity then at the Hastings Center and now at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University  has been a major contributor to this growth But in all that effort he now believes we spent too much time struggling to apply the existing professional ethical codes and not just the Hippocratic Oath to specific issues and not enough time developing one coherent philosophy a systematic set of principles that could serve as a basis for ethical codes in medical matters From the start of the book Dr Veatch makes clear at great length and in great detail that it is larger medical matters that comprise his subject and not just the practice of medicine by doctors He disposes of the Hippocratic Oath the American Medical Associations Principles of Medical Ethics the World Medical Associations Geneva Declaration and all similar doctorgenerated doctorcentered codes They are he argues not philosophies but series of unsystematic unreflective traditions folk ethics that tell us only what a particular group of physicians at a particular time and place in history believed was ethical Whats worse they dont work Hopelessly culturebound full of unrecognized internal contradictions narrow and at their very roots alien to the ethical traditions and political beliefs that are central to our society these codes largely ignore patients rights autonomy and dignity and societal responsibilities As Dr Veatch points out if a doctor should really do only what he or she thinks will benefit an individual patient  the core of the Hippocratic Oath  then all medical research on healthy subjects even with their informed consent is categorically immoral regardless of the potential benefit to millions of others But worst of all most of the existing medical codes are professionally ethnocentric doctorfocused when the vast majority of medical decisions in fact have always been made and continue to be made by ordinary people like the patients who decide whether ornot to seek treatment what medical risks to take in their lives and in their treatment whether or not to comply with a physicians regimen According to Dr Veatch other decision makers include the mothers and fathers of infants the sons and daughters of the afflicted elderly to say nothing of the hospital administrators government health planners nurses and physician assistants And though he believes that the overwhelming majority of physicians are eminently trustworthy he also believes that turning physicians loose on society to do what they think may benefit their patients can lead to programs that are morally outrageous But who should define benefit Certainly not doctors alone One has only to remember at the extreme the crude lobotomies on prisoners and mental patients the Tuskegee syphilis studies the doctors in Chilean prisons who checked their patients to see if they could safely withstand more torture Dr Veatch concludes The only solution is to abandon the idea that an ethic for medicine can be based on a professionally articulated code Medical ethics can no longer be seen as a set of principles or commitments generated from within a profession and transmitted to new members during their socialization into it So far so good although some physicians long conditioned to believe that their own moral sincerity is all that counts will not think so In place of the professional codes Dr Veatch wants to generate a covenant theory of medical ethics  a complex set of understandings among professionals patients and society in general derived from the social contract that binds us all and built upon layers of mutual loyalty fidelity respect and support He wants a negotiation among equals in which the first step is a prolonged orderly thoughtful and open discussion of the basic philosophical principles on which agreem ent m ust be reached before any medical ethics can be established Bravely at the end Dr Veatch offers a first draft of such a covenant But in the process he must cope with the burden of most serious writing in bioethics which has one foot planted firmly in real cases and the other just as firmly mired in formal philosophical systems The cases Dr Veatch presents are real vivid compelling A young mother doomed by cancer entirely alone the only resource for her pitiably deformed daughter wants to kill her child A physician has devastating  but confidential  information about one of his patients whom another of his patients blissfully ignorant plans to marry A young man with an almost certainly fatal leukemia must decide whether to risk an experimental and toxic treatment that might save him or kill him slowly and miserably The philosophy in contrast is more than most general readers may want to tackle Stumbling from epistemology to consequentialism crawling past the doubleeffect principle in Catholic moral theology limping through the lexical ordering of basic principles will stop many readers though its worth a try  a long hard try In fairness to Dr Veatch I am willing to concede that this kind of difficult philosophical language precisely reflects the nature of bioethical discussion going on in hospital wards and appropriations committee conferences Sometimes the very problem or conflict itself is hard to recognize And it is even harder to question ones own principles and embark on a long painful process of reasoning that will as often as not end in confusion with the critical decision still to be made and the patients time running out The road to ethical coherence may be mined with paradox and paved with polysyllables but that is not the real difficulty It is as Dr Veatch asserts that for too long physicians have walked that road in isolation blind to the arrogance of their implicit assumption that they are the only relevant travelers Medical ethical problems will inevitably multiply technology alone will see to that If we the public are truly to participate in the working out of a new medical social contract then perhaps we will need another book in which the cases the choices the underlying principles and the systems of reasoning are all made equally clear  a book I suspect that will take another decade to write

DETAILS OF 'NEW FEDERALISM' PLAN MAY BE SLOW IN REACHING; CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/04/us/details-of-new-federalism-plan-may-be-slow-in-reaching-congress.html,It will be some months before the Administration sends Congress its specific propos als for President Reagans new federalism program White Ho use officials told Congressional Republicans today In his State of the Union Message last week the President proposed a sweeping redefinition of state and Federal responsibilities for domestic programs He outlined a plan to give the states jurisdiction over more than 40 programs administered by the Federal Government In addition the states were to take full responsibility for the food stamp and welfare programs while Washington took over Medicaid the program of medical assistance for the poor However legislation to put the proposals into effect is not expected to reach Congress for quite a while according to an aide to Republican leaders in Congress Delay in Enactment Likely The delay virtually assures that the Reagan program could not be enacted in this session since Congress is expected to adjourn in October to enable members seeking reelection to campaign Even if Congress returns after the November elections to deal with economic problems consideration of the measures is considered remote A White House official explained however that the Administration never foresaw enactment this year A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said that David A Stockman the budget director is expected to send the legislation to Capitol Hill in 40 days But the Administration plans to discuss the new federalism package with state governors who would be asked to take over many programs This process could take some months A snag in the negotiations according to a White House official is the swap of Medicaid for food stamps and welfare Therefore a White House official said the Administration proposed to make the program effective in 1984 so as to give Congress two years to digest and enact the legislation Energy Department Is Target In a related matter the White House has advised Republican Congressional leaders that plans to dismantle the Department of Energy will be offered The elimination of both the Energy and Education Departments was pledged by Mr Reagan in his election campaign He restated the intentions in the State of the Union address White House officials were also said to be uncertain about whether to seek accelerated deregulation of natural gas Another matter on the Administration agenda is an increase in the Federal debt limit expected to be submitted in March The debt limit extended to 1000 billion last year was enacted with the grudging support of moderate and conservative Republicans who had never before voted for such an increase Congressional Republicans acknowledge that passing a second such increase could be just as difficult The Administration has sent word that it will not interfere in Congressional consideration of what are called the social issues such as abortion school prayer and school busing The Republican leaders in Congress had put off such issues last year But they expect them to come up shortly under the pressure of conservative Republicans
SENATE VOTES CURB ON JUDGES' POWER TO REQUIRE BUSING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/05/us/senate-votes-curb-on-judges-power-to-require-busing.html,The Senate today approved a proposal that could virtually eliminate busing as a tool for racial integration of the public schools The proposal drew strong support from both parties and passed by a vote of 58 to 38 a sign that busing had become highly unpopular in many communities The measure would bar the Federal courts from ordering busing plans that transport schoolchildren more than five miles from home or take longer than 15 minutes It would also allow the Justice Department to ask the courts to overturn existing busing plans that exceed these limits The overwhelming social science evidence argued Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana is that busing has failed across America and increased racial isolation Plan Called Unconstitutional Opponents conceded that busing was not popular but attacked the amendment as an exercise in unconstitutionality on the ground that if people suffered from racial discrimination the courts must be free to remedy that wrong Senator Carl Levin Democrat of Michigan noted that more than 20 similar bills now before Congress would restrict the rights of the Federal courts to rule on a wide range of controversial matters Im not somebody who believes that busing is the only answer but I am someone who believes in the Constitution Mr Levin said This sets a precedent If we say the Supreme Court cant enforce the Constitution on busing tomorrrow well say it cant enforce the Constitution on free speech or on some other area Helms an d Johnston Provis ions The measure an amendment attached to a bill authorizing funds for the Justice Department consists of two parts the curb on the courts sponsored by Senator Johnston and a provision sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would prohibit the Justice Department from spending funds to pursue discrimination cases that could lead to courtordered busing Language similar to the Helms provision is contained in the Housepassed version of the bill but the issue is virtually moot at the moment since the Reagan Administration has promised on its own not to pursue such cases The Johnston proposal the most farreaching attack on busing ever to pass a chamber of Congress has no comparable provision in the House bill The next step is a final vote on the bill as a whole Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut who has delayed the antibusing proposal for more than seven months threatened to continue a filibuster and said that he had 300 amendments ready for introduction The Senate leadership will probably try to end the filibuster next week by invoking cloture a parliamentary device to shut off debate that requires the support of 60 Senators That move will probably succeed since 60 senators have already voted twice to end filibusters at earlier stages in the legislative battle When and if the bill passes the Senate it will have to go to a conference with the House Key House members strongly oppose the Johnston rider and would undoubtedly try to keep the legislation bottled up in conference Todays vote marked the beginning of a push by the Republican leadership in the Senate to dispense with the socalled social issues such as school busing school prayer and abortion before Congress again focuses on the economic issues that dominated Capitol Hill last year We intend to try to settle them as quickly as possible said Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska the Republican whip But Senator Weicker said Id be glad to choke the pipeline with their social issues Thats what Im going to do Retreat From Civil Rights Mr Weicker alleged that the Senate vote today was part of a broader effort joined by the Reagan Administration to turn back decades of progress in such areas as voting rights and racial integration Theres a total rout a retreat from the whole issue of civil rights charged the Connecticut lawmaker who is engaged in a tough fight for re election Antibusing sentiment is strong in Senator Johnstons home stateand he noted today that 6yearold children in Baton Rouge travel 90 minutes each way under a courtordered plan Thats idiotic he said Mr Johnston said that he favored school integration and opposed busing because it drove middleclass families of all races out of the public schools He called busing a leech on the educational system and added What good is a remedy if it doesnt work  Senator Weicker charged that opposing busing was great for getting votes but urged his colleagues to consider the constitutional implications Show your face and not your butt to the world he shouted Votes From New York Area Among the other Senators from New York New Jersey and Connecticut also voting against the amendment were Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey Christopher J Dodd Democrat of Connecticut and Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York voted in favor of the amendment Senator Harrison A Williams Jr Democrat of New Jersey did not vote he is in a New York hospital After busing the next social issue slated for Senate consideration is a proposal to prohibit the use of Justice Department funds to pursue school prayer cases

The Constitution as Cudgel,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/06/opinion/the-constitution-as-cudgel.html,Lobbyists who claim to represent the interests of taxpayers have persuaded 31 state legislatures to use the Constitution as a tactical weapon They want to convene a new constitutional convention to pass an amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget or at least to use the threat of such a convention to force Congress to pass it instead Normally amendments are proposed by Congress for ratification by the states But the Constitution also provides for an amendment convention called by twothirds of the states Alaska recently became the 31st state to join the call If three more join Congress would have to respond somehow Supporters of the drive are lobbying hardest in Missouri Washington and Kentucky Its a foolish and potentially dangerous effort for reasons of both substance and procedure Consider the Reagan Administrations difficulty with its forthcoming budget The President truly believes in a balanced budget Yet even for him that is now a distant goal He has discovered that Social Security is untouchable that high interest rates raise the costs of Government along with everything else and that recession cuts sharply into Federal revenues At best he offers the hope that the 1983 deficit can be held below 100 billion If the Constitution now required a balanced budget Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending And that in the middle of a recession would take money from consumers and limit Government spending thus only making the recession worse This loss of economic flexibility is reason enough to oppose the amendment But to press it though a constitutional convention raises questions of even greater magnitude There has never been such a convention no one knows how it would work How would delegates be chosen Could the President veto the bill by which Congress summons the convention demanded by the states Could the courts settle disputes over these questions or review the conventions procedures and proposals Most important could the convention be held to the single issue of a balanced budget Or could it seize the opportunity to offer amendments on everything from abortion to prayer in the schools to the death penalty No one is sure Promoters of the convention say they dont necessarily want it held They hope the prospect will press Congress to compose an amendment of its own Thats possible the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved one and the House may consider a similar measure But then why not confine the whole political effort to lobbying in Congress The convention compaign amounts to a reckless launch of an unguided missile To prevent it the nation must now rely on the good sense of legislators in Missouri Washington and Kentucky
SENATE PUTS THOSE SOCIAL ISSUES ON THE FRONT BURNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/weekinreview/senate-puts-those-social-issues-on-the-front-burner.html,THE economy and the Federal budget are highpriority matters on Capitol Hill these days but conservative lawmakers remain determined to press for enactment of their social issues agenda Last week the Senate ignoring arguments that the measure was unconstitutional approved the most stringent antibusing legislation ever enacted by either chamber an amendment that would take away the power of Federal courts to order students to be bused more than five miles or 15 minutes from their homes The amendment affixed to an authorization bill by a 58to38 vote would also bar the Justice Department from asking judges to use busing as a means of achieving desegregation The ultimate fate of the amendment isnt clear Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr a liberal Republican from Connecticut promised to try killing it with a filibuster Senator Jesse Helms a conservative Republican from North Carolina speculated that after the busing vote this session of the 97th Congress will take final action on controversial matters such as abortion and school prayer If it doesnt he said Well have to start over next January when the 98th Congress is sworn in Last week The Week in Review invited two Republican Senators who disagree on most social issues  Charles McC Mathias Jr a liberal from Maryland and William L Armstrong a Colorado conservative  to consider the f ate of social legislation this year Following are excerpts of their discussion with Steven V R oberts and Martin Tolchin reporters in the Washington Bureau o f The New York Times and Michael Wright an editor of The Review Question Whats the outlook for social issues in this session of Congress Mr Armstrong In the Senate the 1982 session is likely to focus on budgetary matters But its my impression that Howard Baker the Senate majority leader not only does not intend to put social issues on the back burner but has suggested that they be brought up early in the session and its now a question of working out the details and scheduling I think he has expressed appreciation to the proponents of these social issues for giving the Presidents economic program a chance to be acted on last year and in effect has said Okay this is your turn I think youll see very little of the guerrilla tactics that have characterized these debates in the past There will probably be a lengthy and controversial debate on abortion school busing and prayer The probability is that no definitive action will be taken although the Voting Rights Act will be extended in one form or another Mr Mathias I would add a caveat People who are not intimately familiar with the ways of Government and Capitol Hill may not fully appreciate how much chance or circumstance affects public decisions And it may be that somewhere along the line this spring the proponents of one of these issues will see too tempting a situation and will try to press for an advantage That could destroy the balance that Senator Baker has created and could really throw the system out of whack Busing and abortion and school prayer are subjects the American people really havent come to any final conclusions on These are issues that have been stretched out for a generation and polls indicate there still is no overwhelming consensus on any one of them Q Proposed restrictions on busing keep bubbling up Is that an issue whose time has come Mr Armstrong I think clearly busing is a failure in every respect even in terms of the initial objectives of people who favored it A nd I think those who supported it at the outset have now looked ba ck and said this isnt working and there are other and better remedi es to the problem of school integration Mr Mathias From the very beginning people said that the only ones who would really like busing are those who sold school buses And I think thats true No parents want their children to have long tiring bus trips before they start the school day It never was anything more than an experiment in trying to bring about the desegregation of education Q Do you think it worked Mr Mathias Well I have only one problem with Bill Armstrongs comment that there are other and better alternatives  Im not sure there are Mr Armstrong Oh sure there are How about the magnet schools for example If you want to see a system that is solving this problem come out to Denver Colo which is under a court order for busing And which by the way I think may at some point relatively soon be relieved of that obligation by the court Mr Mathias Or you can go to Columbia Md a town that is so designed that there dont have to be any school buses But thats a very rare and exotic kind of answer to this problem And when you get down into the center cities of the older metropolitan areas of America there just are not very many good alternatives And thats the problem Q For some time we have had ongoing filibusters in effect on school prayer and busing Are moderatetoliberal Republicans to continue resisting whether you call it a filibuster or not Mr Mathias Those were issues that came out of the Appropriations Committee of which Senator Weicker is a member so he naturally took the lead The real question is will people attempt to use the appropriations process as a means for bringing about substantive change in the law And if they do it really is your duty to resist I think many Senators feel very strongly that its not just the issue at stake  whether its school prayer busing or abortion or anything else There is a procedural aspect to this that has to be resisted and that is to use the appropriations process to change the law Q Did you feel the same way about using the appropriations process to attempt to end American involvement in the Vietnam War Mr Mathias No and Ill tell you exactly why That was a question of the level of funding for an operation That was the only question before the Congress When you get to a question of whether the courts will have a range of jurisdiction or whether the courts will ha ve a range of judicial remedies that really is a matter that ought to be resolved in the Judiciary Committee and debated on the floor only after the experts in that committee have a chance to consider t he question of the spectrum of court power and authority To try to compress complex constitutional questions into the funding of the Federal courts or the funding of the Justice Department and res tricting its ability to get to the court is to me a perversion of the system Mr Armstrong In my judgment if somebody has an issue that they want to raise and the rules permit it to be raised through use of an appropriations bill I dont criticize them for doing so If somebody wants to filibuster to prevent an amendment from passing youll never hear me criticize that either The rules exist in order to establish a framework under which decisions may be made and theres nothing inherently right or wrong about any particular procedure I do think it lends credibility to a proposed amendment for example if it has been the subject of hearings and study in the committee that has jurisdiction over it But that doesnt make it wrong to raise it on an appropriations bill  particularly where a limitation on funding is the issue such as the limitation on funding for abortion Clearly that is in every sense a proper amendment on an appropriations bill Q What about the extension of the Voting Rights Act The key issue that has emerged in Senate hearings is how to define what is and is not a discriminatory act Do you judge it by its effects or by its intent That is an increasingly emotional and angry point of discussion between Senate liberals and Senate conservatives How would you like to see the law defined Mr Armstrong It appears to me that it is very difficult to justify the way the law has been applied in some jurisdictions and let me cite my own state of Colorado as an example Some counties fall under the supervision of the Federal courts even though there has been no proven instance of anybodys voting rights ever being abridged It seems to me that if you apply an effect test you open the door to a lot of unnecessary interference with local governments And so my tendency is to support the intent test rather than a wholesale application of some sort of predetermined effects test There may be even another possibility that Im not aware of but if it comes down to the choice between the present law and some kind of broader net I would tend to stick with the present law Mr Mathias Im an old city attorney No municipal lawyer worth his salary is going to allow his board of aldermen or his mayor or his town council to get into a situation where their intent to discriminate can be proved in court Therefore I go back to the original Congressional intent which I voted for in 1965 That is that we should have whenever there is a wrong being perpetrated it should be remedied without a lot of legal mumbojumbo about who intended to do what If there is a body of citizens whose rights are threatened then we ought to protect them Its just as simple as that Q How do you feel about antiabortion efforts Is that a legitimate attempt to change a court interpretation or change a court decision Mr Mathias As long as it doesnt try to tamper with court jurisdiction as long as it doesnt try to look for some backdoor way to get a constitutional amendment that cant be achieved out in the open then I think its perfectly legitimate for people to offer bills and amendments to pursue their point of view My main reservation about such efforts is that they are coming at a time when there are other serious urgent and critical problems facing the country Maybe its even a waste of time to devote so much attention to abortion when we may not dispose of it this year Mr Armstrong The same could have been said about slavery in 1860 Even after we fought a war over it the bitterness and controvery lasted for years And even a hundred years later a residue of bitterness is present in our society That doesnt mean it was wrong to go ahead and try to resolve the problem I wouldnt want to be understood as saying that we ought to wait until theres unanimous agreement on abortion or  Mr Mathias Which you never will have Mr Armstrong Which well never have Mr Mathias But on most of those issues if the polls are of any value at all you have a preponderance of people taking one side or another And its clear that there is enough agitation about them that they arent going to be resolved The people really havent made up their minds Blackstone said that the law should be the highest expression of the ethic of a people And I think we really havent resolved what our ethic is in any of these questions Mr Armstrong I happen to feel that abortion is wrong that its simply a practice which should not be encouraged or permitted and I wo uld counsel someone to that effect Yet I h ave never said and I dont say today that the best way to handle the matter is through anamendment to the United States Constitution Nor do I necessarily saythat the way to do it is by imposing limits o n the jurisdiction of the court It may be that there is a statutor y approach short of either of those remedies which would resolve the question if not to the satisfaction of everybody at least by ta king the minimum number of steps that are necessary to get to a decis ion Now having said all that I believe its pretty clear that public opinion does not at the present time support my point of view that by a very wide margin the polls show that the public endorses the notion of abortion But again if this is a basic human right  if it is for example analagous to slavery  the question isnt what public opinion polls say Its a question for each of us to decide as an issue of what we believe to be right

TV View; A SERIOUS SUBJECT FLAWED BY COMPROMISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/arts/tv-view-a-serious-subject-flawed-by-compromise.html,When television entertainment claims to be getting serious duck fast There are notable exceptions carefully crafted and nurtured productions such as Friendly Fire or prestigious adaptations of stage productions But too often when the television studios and networks tackle serious subjects like rape or child pornography the smell of titillation permeates all their protestations about social responsibility Or on another level there is the project that professes to tackle a controversial subject but ends up merely exploiting it Which brings us to Pray TV the madefortelevision movie shown on ABC last Monday Heralded for months as the networks forceful reply to those television evangelists who have been loudly critical of televisions content especially anything having to do with sex Pray TV had been assembled by an impressive group of established names Lane Slate wrote the script Robert Markowitz did the directing and Peter S Greenberg was producer But word of troubles leaked out even before the film made it to the small screen Mr Slate charged that nervous network executives had hacked away at his script to the point where less than half of the original remained intact ABC he charged had changed the beginning and the ending and had deleted whole scenes Mr Slate felt that his work had been hopelessly sanitized On the other side prominent fundamentalist ministers including the Rev Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority and the Rev Donald Wildmon of the Coalition for Better Television  were publicly wondering if the films portrait of a successful video evangelist would not represent a misuse of television ABC obviously must have known that the project would be watched carefully by all interested parties Nevertheless the network moved forward with seeming determination only to drag Pray TV into a series of fatal c ompromises The finished movie offered nothing more than the illu sion of a meaningful confrontation A preoccupation withbalance b ecame an excuse for timidity What was clearly meant to be some sort of statement however guarded turned out to be a puzzling exer cise in filling air time The entertainment padding leftthe project l ooking a lumpy mess The entire rather long initial portion of the film was devoted to a typical installment from The Freddy Stone Hour a production of the Divinity Broadcasting Company The Rev Freddy as he was affectionately referred to was seen being made up for the cameras listening to the warmup tunes of the Divinity Singers and walking out on stage before an applauding studio audience Is Jesus the only way to God somebody asked him evidently curious as to where that left Buddhists and other nonChristians The Rev Freddy went quickly to the Bible for his answer I am t he way the truth and the light No man cometh unto God but by me  He quickly added that if you havent found Jesus call that numbe r at the bottom of your screen This was a promising start actuall y especially with Ned Beatty transforming the Rev Freddy into an i mmediately recognizable figure of saintliness and slickness of wary shrewdness and mirthlesshumor Also sitting in the studio audience as it happened was young Tom McPherson John Ritter just out of divinity school and overflowing with ideals Urged on by the Rev Freddy Tom appealed on camera for funds for missionary work in Brazil scoring so nicely with the both the studio and home audiences that he subsequently received a job offer from Divinity Broadcasting which he readily accepted Tom then became the troubled conscience of the piece increasingly questioning the efficacy of the Rev Freddys electronic church in ministering on a personal level Tom was a serious theologian His hero he confessed was Billy Graham But the Rev Freddy was meant to be  what Going behind the scenes of his religion business the movie showed a complex with offices filled with books and crucifixbuttons for the paying faithful satellites for getting the Stone message to faraway places a staff of smoothly pious workers and banks of moneycounting machines that were tabulating as much as 3 million a month in contributions to the cause The Rev Freddy had a personal helicopter to help get him to cities where the audience ratings were sagging and in need of a personalappearance booster shot He became involved in a political campaign supporting a littleknown local retailer who happened to support all the traditional conservative causes from profamily to antiabortion Throughout Pray TV was exceedingly careful not to be critical of the Rev Freddy except by indirection Contrasted with the unbelievably saintly Tom Freddys worldliness became somewhat questionable But Freddy was always allowed to present his side of the equation with cool indeed admirable conviction If Tom complained about using antennas instead of missionaries to spread the Gospel the Rev Freddy would purse his lips into a patronizing smile and explain that God uses me to speak His word and that television is a wonderful opportunity Even in the end when Tom decided to establish his ministry outside Divinity Broadcasting the Rev Freddy was given a thoroughly graceful exit Youre an incredible man with incredible gifts Tom conceded to the beaming evangelist who then offered another quotation from the Bible The Gospel must first be preached among all nations The battle between the networks and their religious critics was fought to a comforting draw Perhaps in a sense thats as it should be As was pointed out in an article on this page last Sunday the audiences for evangelical television are far below the 100 million to 130 million that have been claimed by some practitioners Indeed ratings services put the combined audiences for the 10 most popular syndicated religion shows at under 13 million viewers ABCs Pray TV might have legitimately explored this aspect of the phenomenon It might have done a lot of things But in promising a fearless expose and in delivering a soggy compromise the movie failed miserably

TURKEY PLANNING LEGAL ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/world/turkey-planning-legal-abortions.html,Turkey is once again taking the lead on womens rights in the Islamic world with preparations for a new law to legalize abortion and permit voluntary sterilization Similar abortion legislation proposed four years ago stirred heated parliamentary debate and was blocked by the small rightwing and Islamic parties Now the military rulers who took power in September 1980 to restore law and order have decided to approve legislation that they consider good for the country This would include the abortion bill according to sources close to the leadership The generals action is in line with the policies of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk the founder of modern Turkey who ardently believed in the equality of the sexes and half a century ago gave Turkish women social and political rights beyond those of any other Moslem country Some protests are expected when the law is approved by the military regime because religious sectors are known to be opposed to abortion With Parliament closed by the regime the military rulers can approach the most delicate issues Most Said to Favor Abortion Most Turks favor legalizing abortion in this country where the practice has become common and is often performed under precarious conditions according to social workers Every year some 500000 Turks have abortions and about 10000 die from complications according to public figures Social workers say that only about 25 percent of the women can afford to have an abortion performed by a gynecologist in a private office a procedure that costs between 50 and 70 Poor women generally resort to selfinduced abortions at home The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare recently presented the new abortion bill to the Prime Minister but then withdrew it to correct certain ommissions the Minister of Health Kaya Kilicturgay was quoted as saying It appeared that the authorities were trying to find a way to counter opposition It Should Be More Liberal When the new abortion law is passed it should be more liberal than that of any other Moslem country and even many European states Dr Ziya Durmus the director of the Ankara Maternity Hospital and a founder of Turkeys family planning association said the other day Dr Durmus pointed out that Tunisia was the first Islamic country to legalize abortion but they are permitted only after a woman has had four children The new law passed by the Kuwaiti Parliament is similar to the law in force in Turkey Under the Turkish penal code women who have abortions and doctors who perform them are subject to one to four years imprisonment The only exceptions are if a womans life is endangered by the pregnancy or if the normal development of the fetus becomes impossible The new Turkish legislation will permit abortions to be performed up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy with only one restriction that both the man and woman agree official sources said It will also permit men and women to be sterilized if they so desire Position of Islam on Abortion Some religious circles are said to object to the draft bill but are not expected to present any generalized opposition The Director General of Religious Affairs Tayyar Altikulac presented a report several months ago to the Health Ministry giving the position of Islam on abortion If there is no lawfully religious excuse abortion or inducing abortion is viewed as murder and Islamic jurisprudence provides for penal sanctions according to the religious affairs report The generally accepted lawfully religious excuse was said to be the health of the woman If giving birth is known to endanger a womans life according to religious sectors abortion is permissible no matter how far into the pregnancy Turkeys main conservative or social de mocratic parties were not opposed to le galizing abortion in the past Nevertheless as on many issues the s maller rightwing and Islamic fundamentalist parties were able to obstruct the approval of a new abortion law Family Planning Is Urged The military authorities have come out publicly in favor of family planning Gen Kenan Evren declared last summer that one of the reasons behind Turkeys unemployment problem was the high rate of population increase He pointed out that the population growth in this country of 45 million was 25 percent a year and urged Turks to slow down  Medical quarters and social scientists have generally pressed for a legalization of abortion for the past 10 years Now however they stress that it is not enough to legalize abortion but that it is also necessary to provide better services to put the new law into effect particularly in rural areas The new law is adequate but there will be technical difficulties because we dont have enough gynecologists to take care of the patients Dr Durmus said Turkan Aksu chairman of the Turkish Mothers Association stressed that there was a lack of competent personnel to handle abortions in the rural areas She also said that more emphasis should be paid to sex education for men and urged that men who do not want to have children be sterilized A seminar entitled Major Issues on the Status of Women in Turkey held last year by the Turkish Social Science Association urged a change in the abortion legislation It recommended that the penal code be amended to legalize abortion on socioeconomic and psychological grounds
MRS. LUCE GOES TO WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/style/mrs-luce-goes-to-washington.html,A number of friends thought shed be upset livid or litigious There it was on magazine stands across the country a cover banner reading Clare Boothe Luce From Courtesan to Career Woman Mrs Luce was indeed unhappy at the line in the February issue of Harpers promoting an excerpt from Wilfrid Sheeds new book on her If it had only read Clare Boothe Luce from career woman to courtesan  she lamented At my age that would have made me sound more interesting Mrs Luce i s 78 years old now with no thought of resting on her laurels or b rambles as the case may be She is a member of the recently reac tivated Presidents Foreign Intelligence Advisory Boardappointed las t November with an office and secretary in the State Department S he is furnishing a cooperative apartment in the Shoreham West  her telephone rings constantly and she plans to spend a good deal o f time here its a city of human proportions She has in the past been a lot of other things  editor playwright investor Congresswoman Ambassador wife of Henry R Luce who was a founder of Time Inc and friend of the rich and famous  but never a courtesan And she said her blues eyes glinting mischievously the chances werent too good what with the dearth of men around A Beauty in Her Youth A great beauty in her youth a physical attribute that often detracted from her accomplishments Mrs Luce is still a juxtaposition of delicate blond fragility a mind that tries on ideas for size like clothes and a decisive nononsense manner She has retained her wit she has named her ulcers Qaddafi and Begin and her public selfassurance is formidable She is what is generally labeled as conservative but touches of the feminist who in 1920 marched and lobbied with Alice Paul an early equal rights advocate poke through occasionally She admits shes a pessimist  the difference between a pessimist and an optimist is that a pessimist has more knowledge of what is going on  but she sees little change in the attitude of women during her lifetime Women simply dont have the passion for power that men do she said The only change in my lifetime is that women no longer want to be objects of male power slaves because the object of power is to reduce people to slaves to push them around Women are interested in achievement excellence ambition but not in raw power which doesnt mean that they arent interested in civic affairs or good government The daughter of a woman she described as a real feminist my mother was deserted by my father Mrs Luce herself was a suffragist She holds out no hope however for passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment Women are the most powerful single interest group and if they want something all they have to do is organize she said They dont want it that badly Its had it She isnt actively unhappy about this turn of events but neither is she completely satisfied about the status of women She believes that single and working women have achieved an equal break but that the same break does not apply to married women Women make an enormous contribution to marriage and they get no pay she said They should be recognized by Social Security and although Im all for states rights there should be standardized state commonproperty and divorce laws The economic contributions made by wives should be acknowledged in the law on the basis of se rvices performed and how long they have be en performed During her speaking engagements Mrs Luce was often embarrassed she said when a woman described herself as only a housewife I think to myself that if I had to do what that women does Id ask the President for a Freedom Medal or something she said There should be prenuptial contracts it was done for centuries in Europe why not here She slid over the subject of abortion What will be more popular than abortion will be euthanasia she said observing that families were having fewer children and that life expectancy had increased Its one thing for six children to support one parent but another for one child to support parents and grandparents she said She added a little sadly Theres no record in history of a nation continuing to grow in power and prestige with a declining birth rate People walk in and take you over Mrs Luce was no happier about the conduct of foreign affairs We talk our heads off about the diversity of ethnic groups in America and the importance of ethnic groups trying to maintain some of their own culture but this tolerance to diversity at home is not shown in foreign relations she said Everyone has to be like us We are practically every day of our lives insulting some nation Mrs Luce has spent a good deal of time since her husbands death in 1967 at her home in Honolulu fulfilling speaking engagements and traveling with women friends Enjoyable she said but with some reservations The real thing you miss is someone to hassle the baggage she said You can get all the men tal stimulation you want with books plays and mus ic but you miss a strong right arm someone to take youout at night someone you can really talk to That is why she believes that women who have freed themselves from children and marriage have lost a great deal of the meaning of life I have always felt that it wasnt so much what went on in the hay but the pillow talk that was so fascinating she said Its someone to talk to at night to compare notes someone to fight with and fuss over Marriage is rather a splendid institution Not all women want children she continued But it is natural and the truth is its rather wonderful I didnt realize until my daughter died her only child Ann Brokaw was killed in a car accident at the age of 19 how many plans I had made for my grandchildren without even knowing I had She said she had few regrets about her life other than I honestly wish I had stuck with my own gift writing I wasnt great at it but I wasnt too bad Mrs Luce wrote a number of books and plays among them The Women I always regretted that I shifted to politics she said You can do nothing truly creative in politics by yourself Youre working with a team all the time At least when you write a play its your own and youve done your thing I think if I had stuck to that I would have had a more fruitful happier and more satisfying life but who knows Enjoyed Diplomacy She did however enjoy diplomacy her stint as Ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1957 Women take naturally to it she said The great trick in diplomacy is to make some unwitting man think your idea is his idea and women have been doing that all their lives Her happiest time What is happy she asked But the time I enjoyed most was the six years after I had divorced George Brokaw and before I married Henry Luce The whole world opened for me I got my first job I became editor of Vanity Fair I had the satisfaction of accomplishing something I wrote a couple of books and plays and I met almost every important creative figure who came to New York That was fun and joy and inspirational Still and all she said I think Ive been the most fortunate person alive I was born at the right time and in the right country
A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF FEMALE SUFFERING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/books/a-complete-catalogue-of-female-suffering.html,BRAIDED LIVES By Marge Piercy 441 pp New York Summit Books 1550 THE rise of feminism over the last 15 years has been accompanied by a proliferation of feminist novels  frankly didactic Bildungsromans whose subject is the education of a heroine and of the reader too into the painful realities of womans place Some of these novels are complex and inventive  Nina Schneiders The Woman Who Lived in a Prologue Fay Weldons Down Among the Women Joanna Russs sciencefiction classic The Female Man Others are as pat as pamphlets All however share a moral urgency a zest for the role of tutor that seem more characteristic of the 19th century than our own As much as Uncle Toms Cabin or for that matter Oliver Twist these novels are meant to awaken their readers to injustice and move them toward personal and political change Its not for nothing that Erica Jong called one of her novels How to Save Your Own Life Fifteen years is a long time though  long enough youd think for everyone not enrolled in a Total Woman seminar to have gotten the message As I cracked open Marge Piercys fat new novel which is about growing up female in the 50s I must say I wondered if she could possibly have anything to say that has not already been said  and said and said  before Does she Well yes and no If you remember  or fantasize  the 50s as an era of innocent pleasures and social harmony think again For Jill Stuart our narrator and her friends the 50s mean McCarthyism an intellectual climate of stodgy conservatism sex without birth control and a vicious though covert struggle for power between the sexes Jill is impulsive rebellious smart an outsider from the start a halfJewish tomboy who hangs out with the local toughs in her workingclass Detroit neighborhood writes poetry and worries that her sex play with her girl friends means that she is an L A scholarship to college is her chance to escape the life of female drudgery that has already claimed her best friend Callie pregnant and married off to a garage mechanic by 16 Jills parents think such a life is good enough for their daughter  the father out of indifference he had wanted a son the mother out of resentment at her own balked life that has come in middle age to border on lunacy At the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor Jill discovers literature politics and the rich female life of the dormitory Her closest friend is her blonde beautiful boycrazy cousin Donna but there are others sarcastic Julie sad harddrinking Theo Alberta Mann the longhaired folk singer whose parents are Communists Jill and her friends are the campus bohemians  they read Sartre drink Chianti and scorn the pink plastic girls who wont sleep with their boyfriends Their hunger for experience however leads them smack up against the repressive sexual mores  and reality  of the day One moment they are declaiming the need for total honesty with men and vowing that they will never end up possessive and dependent like their mothers The next they are worrying that they will do something castrating to their boyfriends in whom they wouldnt dream of confiding their frequent pregnancy scares Free love sneers Jills mother who sees men as powerful but stupid deities to be placated and deceived And she is on to something Jills pretentious Existentialistpoet boyfriend Mike does dump Jill when her parents try to force him to marry her just as Mrs Stuart said he would When Jill discovers she is pregnant it is her mother who draws on her store of folk remedies and produces finally one that works although it nearly kills her daughter in the process Love is not free for Donna either who a few years later finds herself pregnant after being raped by a townie she picks up on a whim Where does a scholarship student get 350 for an illegal abortion Not from her boyfriend who must never know that his golden girl has been sullied Jill by now involved with a townie herself takes part in a burglary to raise the cash Jill will recover from Mikes traumatic desertion and continue to look for a love that does not entail her subjection  with rich sinister Peter with her townie thief with warm intelligent Howie We know from page one that Jills quest is eventually successful  she will become the wellknown poet and feminist activist who lives happily on Cape Cod with her lover and writes these memoirs Not everyone fares so well One friend will die of an illegal abortion Another will become a civilrights worker and be murdered by racists in the South Julie will marry dopey Carl and subside into domesticity Others however will blossom in the political ferment of the 60s Alberta will become a feminist lawyer The womens movement will rescue Theo from her madness Stephanie will open a hippie boutique As Jill says We were all a little crazy in the 50s but weve been getting clearer and clea rer ever since Hear hear Its always refreshing to have someone speak up for the 60s and Im sure Im not the only veteran of those years who takes a certain pleasure in books that point out how bad the bad old days that preceded them really were Much of Piercys material will be familiar even platitudinous to readers of say The Bell Jar The Womens Room or even Ms magazine But the accent is placed in a new and bracing way Too many heroines of feminist novels are privileged fragile innocents A discouraging professor a patronizing boyfriend a pushy parent are enough to make them resign their ambitions and sleepwalk into obedient housekeeping for a husband the reader can see from the start is a creep Piercys women are fighters Jill is as eager to explore sexuality as any young man she listens to Mike and her professors disparage her poetry and keeps right on writing she breaks laws Donna also actively seeks sexual pleasure and even when married persists however furtively in asserting her will Even Jills ignorant witchy mother has her weapons the oldfashioned female ones of hysteria and subterfuge Piercy burns with anger and conviction and much of the time its catching We are as outraged as she by the doctors who refuse to fit Jill with a diaphragm because she is unmarried by the abortions without anesthetic or followup care by vital young women producing earnest selfcastigating Freudian analyses of their failure to adjust I wish Piercy had been content to let a part stand for the whole But as though afraid we will overlook some facet of female misery if she doesnt drum it into our heads she methodically makes poor Jill  Company victims of every possible social cruelty and male treachery usually more than once Besides her two abortions and the rape Donna is seduced as a teenager by her sisters husband betrayed by a married man who tells her hes getting a divorce addicted to tranquilizers by her psychiatrist and beaten by her husband who also purposely makes the tiny hole in her diaphragm that results in the pregnancy that dooms her Th eo is committed to an institution once by the psychiatrist who raped her and again aft er she is expelled from college for sleeping with another girl who some pages earlier tried to kill herself Even Jill who is tougher than her friends is sexually attacked by her boyfriend at age 14 forced to make love by Mike when she doesnt want to sodo mized against her will by Peter And so on All right all right I wanted to shout I get the point Because Piercy is an intensely dramatic writer none of this is scene by scene incredible Cumulatively though it does wear one down Were there no loving fathers in the 50s No honorable boyfriends No professors who encouraged their female students There were times when I suspected that the author was unwilling to edit autobiographical material  But Theo really was raped by her psychiatrist  and times when I thought she simply felt she owed it to women to recite the complete catalogue of female suffering Whatever her reasons they give Braided Lives a lurid predictability like a kind of feminist National Enquirer and a tone too of patronizing the reader While it never quite loses its energy and forward motion Braided Lives is less compelling than Piercys last novel Vida her fastpaced tale of a Weatherwoman on the run with its fascinating portrait of life underground Vida made a lot of the same points about womens lives so did Piercys earlier novel Small Changes which even contains another husband who sabotages his wifes birth control but which also provides the most accurate and evocative picture I know of leftist and countercultural Cambridge Mass in the early 70s That Braided Lives is as interesting as it is is a tribute to Piercys strengths She is blunt she is heavyhanded  shes certainly no prose stylist  and yet by virtue of her sheer force of conviction plus a flair for scene writing she writes thoughtprovoking persuasive novels fiction that is both political and aimed at a popular audience but that is never just a polemic or just a potboiler Braided Lives wont win any literary prizes but it will make its readers pay more attention to the current attack on legal abortion and make them more eager to defend the imperiled gains of the womens movement For a novelist whose aim is didactic thats no small compliment
The Court Strippers,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/08/opinion/the-court-strippers.html,Some senators want to rewrite the old maxim that for every wrong theres a remedy The current rightwing version is that for every right that the Federal courts recognize there should be a law that strips the courts of the power to enforce it In one bill after another Congressmen want to tell Federal courts to stay out of important controversial cases Its an easy way to tame an overactive judiciary say voices on the right But if they were true conservatives they would recognize these courtstripping bills for what they really are cheap attacks on the Constitution On the Senate floor now the attack is on busing via an appropriations rider that forbids busing even when it is the only remedy for purposeful school segregation Later there will be a bill directing Federal courts to reopen old school cases and abandon milder desegregation remedies unless minorities can prove their cases all over again Then theres a bill to define abortion as murder and deny Federal courts and the Supreme Court the power to say the contrary Another bill would forbid Federal court interference with voluntary public school prayer as defined by those who want to skirt Supreme Court rulings All these are offered as perfectly proper courtregulating measures All are of dubious constitutionality All are dangerous Is that merely partisan opinion Its shared by distinguished lawyers of all political coloration The American Bar Association president David Brink fears the courtstripping bills will create the most serious constitutional crisis since our great Civil War The chief justices of all 50 states call the idea a hazardous experiment with the nations judicial system Retired Justice Potter Stewart said last year that he was glad he wouldnt have to review such laws and I hope this Court will never have to wrestle with such questions because I hope that no such legislation will be enacted Robert Bork a critic of many Supreme Court decisions has made clear his belief that courtstripping is no way to deal with unpopular rulings his conservative credentials are such that President Reagan has named him to the United States Court of Appeals in Washington One of the few notable lawyers missing from this company is Attorney General William French Smith The danger of these courtstripping bills is appreciated at every level of the Justice Department but the top one He seems to fear the wrath of the new right more than the destruction of old rights The courtbaiting senators are right when they say the Constitution allows Congress to change Federal court jurisdiction and regulate the Supreme Courts review powers But that is a lot different from insisting that Congress can selectively wipe out constitutional rights by cutting citizens off from Federal courts Its sad that other senators like Lowell Weicker of Connecticut should have to filibuster to make the point bills like the antibusing measures are umpirekilling tricks their anticonstitutional purpose only thinly disguised But its not too late for Congress to wake up and recognize what it is being asked to do It should defend the courts not assault them

PLAN CASTS DOUBTS ON ABORTION AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/08/style/plan-casts-doubts-on-abortion-aid.html,Among the many issues raised by President Reagans new federalism is the future of Medicaidfinanced abortions Supporters of the right of choice on abortion say they fear that sweeping realignment of governmental responsibility for health and social services could spell the end of the Medicaid abortion program which has already been sharply reduced Opponents of abortion contend that the plan would serve as a helpful step on route to the abolition of abortion If enacted into law by Congress the new federalism which was set forth in the recent State of the Union Message would transfer full responsibility for financing Medicaid to the Federal Government and would turn over to the states control over Aid to Families With Dependent Children food stamps and 43 other federally funded programs While the financing of abortions for poor women has never been the central purpose of Medicaid it has been one of the programs most bitterly contested components generating conflicts in Congress state legislatures and the courts At issue now is the future of abortion in 14 states and the District of Columbia that currently finance the procedures for Medicaideligible women Medicaid is the Federal and state program of health care for the needy In 1980 the Supreme Court ruled that Congress was under no obligation to fund abortions for the poor except in cases in which pregnancy was a threat to the womans life The Federal Government has since been paying for about 3000 abortions a year Five States Under Court Order Nine states  Alaska Colorado Hawaii Maryland Michigan New York North Carolina Oregon and Washington  and the District of Columbia decided to fund abortions with state Medicaid funds Five others  California Connecticut Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania  continued to do so under court order The 14 states are said to account for 75 percent of women eligible for Medicaid so that many of those who seek Government help have been able to get it For the fiscal year 1977  the last year before the Hyde Amendment which prohibits the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortions except those intended to save a womans life  went into effect the Medicaid program paid for 294600 abortions In fiscal 1979 the last year for which statistics are available the number was 209272 Discussion centers on how if the Medicaid financing is taken over entirely by the Federal Government states would continue to pay for and administer Medicaid abortion programs In New York which over the last few years has paid for 46000 abortions a provision of the Social Services Law mandates Medicaid reimbursement for surgery which if delayed would make the surgical procedure more complicated  an indirect re ference to abortion according to the deputy majority leader of th e State Assembly Alan G Hevesi Democrat of Forest Hills If Congress puts the swap concept into law it will put states out of the Medicaid business and will nullify that law said Assemblyman Hevesi who drafted much of the abortion rights legislation in the state If New York created its own program for financing abortions for the poor the Assemblyman predicted that the Legislature would not be likely to approve the plan A somewhat different principle is at stake in those states providing fun ds under court order In most cases they were directed to do so to c onform with state constitutions and because it could be construed as discriminatory to one segment of the Medicaideligible population if funds for a particular procedure were withheld The Obligation Question But if there is no program to begin with then the issue of discrimination becomes irrelevant said Rhonda Copelan a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who argued in both the Federal District and Supreme Courts for maintenance of comprehensive Medicaid coverage The question then becomes Absent the underlying program does the state still have an obligation to fund Medicaid abortions Federal officials are still uncertain how the plan would work A group to study it has been appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S Schweiker and recommendations will probably go to Congress in March according to a department spokesman Lacking specific information leaders of prochoice and prolife organizations lawyers and governmental officials are speculating about the impact of the plan Jeannie Rosoff president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute the research and policy affiliate of Planned Parenthood said Since states would no longer have any responsibility for the provision of health services to the poor and would have to set up something unique to fund abortions it is unlikely that they would do so This could be potentially devastating Miss Copelan said It strengthens the hand of those opposed to Medicaid funding and strengthens those favoring a complete elimination of abortion Right to Life View Dr Jack Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said We believe that this would redound to our advantage and save babies lives Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois for whom the amendment virtually eliminating Federal Medicaid funds for abortion is named predicted that few states would choose to establish their own programs Anything that lessens the availability of abortion is good and anything that protects preborn human life is good he said The debate over the impact of the Presidents plan which is widely expected to face strong opposition may be rendered moot if Congress approves an amendment to be discussed this week by the Senate Judiciary Committee The amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah would allow Congress and the states to prohibit abortion and declares that the right to have an abortion is not protected by the United States Constitution as the Supreme Court has ruled
POWER SHIFT SEEN IN STATE DISTRICTING; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/10/nyregion/power-shift-seen-in-state-districting-news-analysis.html,No matter how the Legislature redraws the states po litical boundaries the new district lines will radically alter theba lance of power in the Legislature between New York City and the re st of the state And regardless of how the partisan political bickering ends the decision of the Legislature  or of the courts if the Legislature cannot decide  will set the terrain of political battle in the state for the next decade The basic shift in political power away from New York City was made clear in the 1980 census results which showed substantial declines in the citys population relative to the rest of the state But that decline could be magnified by the way in which the Legislature reapportions itself The changes in the Republicancontrolled State Senate could be especially profound Currently there are six Republican Senators from New York City and a seventh whose district includes part of the city Vital Role of 7 Senators The seven Senators play an important role in the Senate Republican majority because without their votes the Senates Republicans could not control their house Under the reapportionment plan put forward by the Republicans however Republicans outside New York city could muster the 31 votes needed to pass a bill and run the Senate without a single vote from the city Advo cates of the citys interests here fear this could substantially weaken their bargaining position In the Assembly in the meantime the city will suffer a loss of four or five of its 65 seats while upstate areas will gain new representation In addition the New York City contingent in Albany is likely to lose some of its white members and gain a larger black and Hispanic minority The people who will gain power in the Assembly are city blacks and upstaters said Assemblyman Melvin H Miller a Brooklyn Democrat deeply involved in reapportionment FarReaching Consequences These developments underline the extent to which the arcane process of reapportionment  can have broad consequences across a wide range of policy matters Already some legislators facing the possibility of running for reelection in substantially changed districts are reassessing their views on a number of issues including such emotional questions as abortion and the death penalty Others will have to familiarize themselves with neighborhoods that are radically different from those they now represent For example Senator Martin Connor a Brooklyn Democrat may have to run in a district that includes Staten Island a part of the world quite unlike his current constituency of Brooklyn Heights and lower Manhattan All over the country redrawing political districts to conform with the population shifts described in the 1980 census has set off fractious partisan battling The fight in New York has been especially difficult because each party controls a house of the Legislature  giving each party a chance to foil the others plans Arguments of the Parties The Republicans have resisted the Democrats plan because they believe the Democrats want to make the Republicans absorb as much of the citys lost Assembly representation as possible The Republicans argue that they could lose all but two of their seven Assemblymen from New York City I go into this with the idea of extracting fair representation for minorities said Donald Zimmerman the Republicans reapportionment specialist and in New York City one of those minorities is Republicans The Democrats say that the more important change is in the Senate where Republicans hope to build a 37to24 margin over the Democrats With 31 of those Senators coming from outside the city the swing role now played by the citys Republicans could become far less important Some of the citys Republican Senators publicly dispute the view that their influence will decline Its impossible to run the Senate on a bare 31vote majority said Senator Frank Padavan of Queens He added that it would be foolhardy for any Republican majority leader to ignore the city entirely Andersons Record Cited Moreover Democrats and Republicans both contend that the Senates current majority leader Senator Warren M Anderson of Bighamton has a history of supporting the city on a number of issues and that he is not likely to change quickly But privately city Republicans worry that even if Senator And ersoncontinues to favor certain measures to help t he city he would have more difficulty in selling them to a party ca ucus that was even more heavily dominated by upstaters than it is now  And a future leader might be less inclined to help the city with out the pressure of city Republicans Even in the Assembly where the Democratic majority will still count on electing well over half its members from city districts the upstate voice will be louder Democrats already say frequently and proudly that theirs is a statewide party a piece of rhetoric designed to help upstate and suburban Democrats win elections The term is just another way of saying that the Democrats are something other than a New York City party The inexorable pressure of population movements is likely to make that claim an even more important political battle cry in the 1980s
A POLITICAL ACTION UNIT OF THE LEFT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/10/us/a-political-action-unit-of-the-left.html,The Democratic left looking to the Republican right as a role model is about to try its hand at negative campaigning a prospect that has this citys Democratic establishment a little edgy The Progressive Political Action Committee which goes by the acronym Propac and borrows heavily from its Republican counterpart the National Conservative Political Action Committee or Ncpac is in a tendonslashing kneecapping mood as it prepares for the 1982 Congressional elections Working from highrent offices on L Street the recently organized group is plan ning strategy and sending out fundraising appeals for an assault on a hit list of conservative Republican senators To some people of both parties such independent politically unaccountable groups are the campaign equivalent of motorcyle gangs even when they stay within the law they are not a welcome sight Leaders of Propac however contend that negative campaigning is a fact of life and that Democrats if necessary should sacrifice virtue to give the Republican right tit for tat Targets Set for 82 and 84 Propac targets for 1982 are Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico in 1982 For 1984 and every election thereafter if necessary it has its eye on Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina calling him the most dangerous man in American public life A sample of what is to come can be gleaned from some of the newspaper ads the committee has prepared and begun to place around the country To keep government and Jesse Helms out of your bedroom you must first get Jesse Helms out of the Senate says one ad that shows Mr Helms dressed in a Keystone cops uniform standing over a couples bed with a flashlight The ad goes on to accuse the Senator of pushing legislation that would allow the Government to dictate the most private family planning decisions of a husband and wife Regular Democrats who complained bitterly about the negative ad campaigns Ncpac used against liberal Democratic senators in 1980 are not sure what to make of Propac One concern is that its activities would make it difficult for Democrats to assail the Republican right for its negative personal attacks on candidates Utah Chairman Objects Michael T Miller the Democratic chairman in Utah has demanded that Propac stay out of his state warning that its brand of campaigning could backfire and jeopardize the partys chance of defeating Senator Hatch Liberal Democrats in Congress and in the celebrity world have refused to sign Propacs fundraising letters that attack individual senators in some cases sending checks with their regrets And the Democratic National Committee appears to be trying to look the other way Victor Kamber a founder of Propac and its treasurer said that Democrats have been more critical of his political action committee so far than have Republicans something he had been warned to expect We knew it would be this way but we made up our minds to take the heat said Mr Kamber who heads a public affairs co ncern that primarily represents labor unions Mr Kamber whose office walls are decorated with art from the labor and civil rights struggles said that PROPAC was born out of a sense of frustration among young liberal Democrats There was this feeling that we had to do something even though nobody was quite sure what he said Propac may fall on its face or it may make it Its too early to tell But at least its an effort to do something to counter the right wing At this point Propac is nothing formidable It has a tiny staff and a list of about 10000 contributors The committees executive director is Harriett Matthews who previously headed the political action committee of the National Abortion Rights Action League Propac is basically Harriet and myself and a handful of other people whose names nobody would know said Mr Kamber who has worked for the AFLCIO and who supported a movement to draft Senator Edward M Kennedy for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1980 Unlike Ncpac with its multimilliondollar budget Propac does not expect to be able to throw much money into its campaign Mr Kamber said the organization has about 200000 at this point and will try to spend it in close races where 40000 in ads might make a difference OutofState Contributions One such race he said is in Utah where Senator Hatch is seeking a second term Even though the states Democratic Party executive committee has told Propac not to meddle Mr Kamber said the committee had not yet decided whether to heed the request He said that Senator Hatch had defeated Frank Moss the Democratic incumbent in 1976 by making an issue out of contributions to Mr Mosss campaign by outofstate labor organizations If Mr Hatch and Ncpac think there is something wrong with raising money out of state then lets talk about the quarter of a million dollars Mr Hatch has raised from outofstate business and oil interests said Mr Kamber Propacs newspaper ad against Mr Hatch puts it this way When Orrin Hatch cries Wolf big business sends money Mr Kamber said the toughest ad against a candidate i s one aimed at Sena tor Schmitt It says that only one bill sponsored by MrSchmitt in hi s first term has passed a law to compensate a small number of peo ple who bought subleases on an Indian reservation from a bankrupt la nd development company Jack Schmitt may not get much done in the Senate but he sure looks good doing it declares the headline Unlike Ncpac said Mr Kamber Propac will not use lies distortions and fearmongering And he added not all of its political activities will involve negative campaigningWere going to be positive on the issues he said Well run different campaigns in different districts depending on the political situation Terry Dolan the executive director of Ncpac was said by his office to be traveling today and could not be reached for comment but he and Mr Kamber have had a number of cordial meetings Democrats said Mr Kamber can learn from the Republican rights use of technology targeting and campaign tactics as practiced by Mr Dolan and by Richard Viguerie the directmail fundraiser of the right While others get angry at Viguerie and Dolan Im just jealous he said They have the fire in the belly to produce results for their cause Im a great sponge and Im learning all I can from them
Required Reading; The Right to Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/us/required-reading-the-right-to-vote.html,Vilma S Martinez President and General Counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund testifying at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution about the Voting Rights Act Jan 27 1982 Hispanics have had the protections of the Voting Rights Act for only seven years  a short time in which to remedy generations of purposeful exclusion In that short period of time we have begun to enter the mainstream of American poliitical life not without obstacles but with the protective shield of the Voting Rights Act Now is not the time to diminish these protections and retreat from the national commitment to minority voting rights While welcoming President Reagans recent endorsement of bilingual elections as important as the bilingual provisions are to Hispanics they do not represent the extent of the voting discrimination we face President Reagans support of the bilingual provisions stops far short of addressing the breadth of the problem When this Congress suspended the use of literacy tests in 1965 it did not send out a message advocating illiteracy It was not suggested that any person be satisfied with not knowing how to read or write Similarly bilingual election materials do not limit the primacy of the English language They stimulate interest and participation in a system in which voters feel they have a voice Smith on Lawyers Attorney General William French Smith speaking to the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association in Chicago Jan 25 1982 For the past year as Attorney General of the United States I have gained new insight into the role of lawyers in our society  and the publics understanding of that role The Attorney General like all lawyers represents clients and is the advocate for their interests in the courts In addition however the Attorney General owes another allegiance  as do all lawyers an allegiance to our Constitution and legal system to the effective operation of the legal system and to its preservation and improvement Over the past year I have often been struck and sometimes bemused by the confusion evinced in the press over those two roles I can personally attest to the accuracy of what is called Knolls Law of Media Accuracy Everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true except for the rare story of which you happen to have firsthand knowledge Civil Servants Status David Cohen President of the Social Developement Corporation in remarks before the Philadelphia Fellowship Commission Feb 3 1982 It is no secret that by any standard morale among civil servants in Washington is low How could it be otherwise when the last four Presidents talked about the Civil Service with the same abandon children use when they play kick the can It is bad enough when knocking Government workers is part of an election campaign It is unforgivable when it is a staple cheap shot of elected and appointed officials who would rather use civil servants as punching bags and not as problem solvers If we want the different sectors to cooperate with one another and deal with a range of domestic issues then we must stop making stereotypical and illinformed comments about Government workers They are part of the solution and given what they know they have much to contribute Goldwater on Courts Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona in a speech yesterday on the Senate floor concerning various measures before Congress that would limit the jurisdiction of the Federal courts The pending legisation and related measures which include provisions to curb all or a portion of judicial jurisdiction over social issues  such as busing abortion and prayer raise serious questions of a constitutional and historic nature Whatever our viewpoints may be on the various social issues as a matter of policy there are fundamental principles involving the separation of powers doctrine and independence of the courts that must be balanced against our feelings about busing or whatever the immediate subject is There is no question but that the framers once r ejected granting Congress the power to limit Federal trial cou rt jurisdiction of casesarising under the Constitution which include s most cases addressing social matters On Aug 27 1787 in the fina l weeks of the Constitutional Convention the delegates disa greed to language reading In all the other cases before ment ioned the judicial powershall be exercised in such manner as the legi slature shall direct The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is another matter Article III Section 2 provides that the Court shall have appellate jurisdiction with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make Even here it is arguable whether Congress can allow general review power by the Supreme Court in specific classes of cases and then chip out narrow areas of these subjects solely for reasons of social policy A related question is whether Congress can accomplish by means of its power over appellate review actions affecting constitutional rights which it could not achieve directly The legal questions about the power of Congress to control the jurisdiction of US courts could be debated endlessly Putting aside these legal and technical questions we must go on to another question which is whether or not it is wise and enduring policy to say that the Federal courts are forbidden to use certain kinds of remedies in cases properly brought before them or are denied jurisdiction to consider this or that social issue The separation of powers concept runs through each and every provision of the Constitution Alexander Hamilton writes in the Federalist Paper No 78 that There is no liberty if the power of judging be not separate from the legislative and executive powers Hamilton continued by writing that The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution Which he defined as a Constitution which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority The Bill of Rights for example provides exactly such limits on the Congress What we are talking about today is not just a subject relating to a controversial issue that confronts school children and their parents at this moment of our history The real question runs far deeper and affects the essence of our basic constitutional doctrines
POPE TO NIGERIANS: DEFEND THE FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/world/pope-to-nigerians-defend-the-family.html,Pope John Paul II said mass today for hundreds of thousands of Nigerian Catholics at the outskirts of this city which was a battleground that changed hands many times during the countrys civil war The crowd mostly Ibo tribesmen from this province in eastern Nigeria that briefly seceded to form the independent nation of Biafra overflowed with enthusiasm when the Pope on the first full day of his African journey landed in a helicopter The people chanted danced and waved paper papal flags of yellow and white and Nigerian ones in green and white The bitter civil war that put down the secession is forgotten former Biafrans said and no one referred to it The crowd rushed at the police lines to get nearer to the visitor who wearing a red broadbrimmed hat waved and smiled broadly from the back of a jeeplike vehicle But the people fell quiet when the Pope called on them to silently confess their sins to begin the mass In his homily the first of four he delivered today here and in Enugu once the capital of strongly Roman Catholic Biafra he set the theme of all his messages of the day Defends Traditional Values He admonished his audiences to defend traditional religious ethical and social values against the onrush of modernity in a developing country enjoying a huge inflow of petroleum revenues His homily at the morning mass here was a celebration of the family and a condemnation of the modern influences that the Pope believes threaten the institution He listed them as divorce contraception and abortion and he described them as the modern enemies of the family the disturbing degradation of some fundamental values He condemned polygamy which is practiced e ven among Catholics in Africa The Pope warned Nigerians that only by stre ngthening family structures will they avoid having a society that runs the risk of becoming more and more depersonalized and sta ndardized and thereforeinhuman and dehumanizing  In a country whose populationgrowth rate believed to be above 3 percent is wreaking havoc with development plans he praised the ProLife Organization for advancing responsible parenthood in accordance with the teachings of the church He urged youths to speak out against the ills of their society and listed without identifying them as such some phenomena of Nigerian life They were bribery and corruption the embezzlement of government or company funds extravagant and unproductive spending the parade of wealth neglect of the poor and the friendless nepotism tribalism political antagonism denial of the rights of the poor abortion contraception The Pope urged young people to take part in political life But later in the day addressing priests and seminary srtudents in Enugu he said priests must not participate Party politics is not for you he declared

TEEN-AGERS' ABORTIONS INCREASING ON L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/nyregion/teenagers-abortions-increasing-on-li.html,A TEST confirmed that she was pregnant Troubled and guilty about the predicament she faced resulting from a relationship with her first and only boyfriend she asked a rabbi if by having an abortion she would be committing a sin His answer was not comforting But after weighing the options considering whether to risk the disapproval of her parents and society by dropping out of college without work skills to bear and raise a child alone the 18yearold freshman had the pregnancy terminated at a Long Island abortion clinic Her problem was similar to those faced by her counterparts across the Island and the country where nationwide of the 15 million abortions performed annually  a number up from 13 million in 1977  it is estimated that onethird are performed on teenagers According to statistics compiled by the Nassau County Health Department the number of legal abortions performed countywide has been climbing steadily since 1971 11 years ago New York State legalized abortion three years before the United States Supreme Court ruled that abortion was legal when 5827 abortions were performed in the county That number rose to 7389 in 1980 In 1980  out of the total number of 7389  5100 abortions were performed on single women including 1722 teenagers The New York State Department of Health reported that in 1978 more than 63000 girls aged 10 to 19 in the state became pregnant Further data reported by the Nassau County Health Department show that in 1980 some 45 abortions were performed on females under 15 and 83 on 15yearolds with the numbers rising to 548 for the 18yearold group and 554 for the 19yearol d group in the county Rose Brown the executive director of Planned Parenthood in Nassau County sees a steady rise in the number of teenagers seeking contraception advice and pregnancy diagnosis and counseling Teenagers are having more abortions Mrs Brown said They are one group that uses less effective means of contraception and they are also a group that perceives itself as less ready to have a child Although we do see some 14  15 and 16yearolds the largest group is the older teenagers Asked if these teenagers were using abortion as a means of contraception Mrs Brown said she did not believe so Some adolescents dont know about contraception or they know but dont know where the information is available she said Also they have a lot of misinformation about the reproductive cycle and are frightened of contraceptives such as the pill Some are afraid to include their parents in discussions on the subject Last year Planned Parenthood a national nonprofit organization with 188 affiliates counseled 1200 women on Long Island about options available to them regarding unwanted pregnancies to have the pregnancy and keep the baby to have the baby and give it up for adoption or to terminate the pregnancy We are nonjudgmental and have no stake in what they choose  all options are equally legal Mrs Brown said Dr Ronald Shenker the head of the division of adolescent medicine at Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center in New H yde Park believes that in the last five years teenage pregnancy has increasedat a steady rate There are no single answers he said as to why so many young women are finding themselves pregnant I think the situation is indigenous to the teenage population For some it is a lack of knowledge but for the majority I believe it is a teenage feeling that it cant happen to me It is an omnipotence that many feel Other vulnerable and lonely young women Dr Shenker suggested want to get pregnant so that for the first time in their lives they have something of their own When pregnant youngsters come to the hospitals adolescent clinic Dr Shenker said they are referred to the teenage pregnancy program at the Queens Hospital Center in Jamaica an affiliation of Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center There under a federally financed program the hospital staff provides medical and psychiatric care to young mothers and their families Services include obstetrical and gynecological attention care for the newborn socialwork counseling and school and jobplacement assistance Long Island Jewish Hospital does not perform routine abortions The hospital does not terminate pregnancy unless the patient is at high risk and has had an amniocentesis procedure that indicates the need for abortion because of anticipated medical problems In our teenage counseling program we try to involve parents  the entire family support system Dr Shenker said Discussing the ignorance factor sometimes associated with unwanted teenage pregnancies he said that recently a teenager visited the adolescent clinic for a totally unrelated problem  we discovered she was seven months pregnant We are attempting to get this kid to tell her mother For those women who do decide to terminate a pregnancy Planned Parenthood which does not recommend medical facilities but does make spot checks of clinics uses the following criteria to determine if an abortion clinic is put on its referral list 1 The facility should be staffed with boardcertified obstetricians and gynecologists 2 A backup arrangement should be available with a nearby hospital for possible emergencies 3 Physicians and personnel must practice good techniques and use proper equipment 4 The facility has to meet criteria for safety and cleanliness According to Dr Moshe Hachamovitch a gynecologist who with four associates operates the Long Island Gynecological Group with offices in Hempstead and Lindenhurst one explanation for the apparent rising number of teenagers pregnancies is that in the past there were not many providers of this service on Long Island so patients went to Manhattan Possibly he believes the numbers are the same today but the locale has shifted to the Long Island area Dr Hachamovitch an assistant professor of gynecology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine spoke of the difficulty of opening an office on the Island in the mid1970s attributing it to what he termed part of a political conservatism on Long Island that made it hard to get landlords to rent buildings The landlords he said would think twice hem and haw and finally say We have other tenants interested in the space  It was not until 1979 Dr Hachamovitch said that he finally f ound an atmosphere receptive to his opening an office  The Long Island Gynecological Group sees a few thousand patients annually These patients are often teenagers and are generally not married The price of an abortion here is 150 If we increased the fee the teenage patient could not afford it Dr Hachamovitch said The average person I serve does not carry a credit card At a similar facility Womens Choice in Hicksville Susan Schecter the executive director said that the offices there is one in Centereach offer routine gynecological and counseling services related to birth control The patient seems to be getting younger Mrs Schecter said Within the last few months we are seeing a greater number of 16  17 and 18yearolds The patient profile in Hicksville is generally middleclass and unmarried The fee is 155 The Hicksville facility is rented and according to Mrs Schecter who also spoke of a conservative political climate the office is not allowed to advertise its exact address She added that every Saturday we are picketed by members of the antiabortion movement At one time she said the picketing became so aggressive that a doorman was stationed at the entranceway Mrs Schecter contends that the Womens Choice facility does not exist just to earn money but is performing a needed lowcost service with the stress on contraception information no t abortion S he added We dont say to patients When are you having your a bortion We ask What do you feel you want to do  While it is accepted by medical authorities that firsttrimester abortions are generally safe and simple procedures the increase in teenage pregnancies comes at a time when the influence of the antiabortion movement on the Island is rising Leaders of the movement are discussing what the best strategies would be to gain passage of a constitutional amendment against abortion A Senate judiciary subcommittee recently gave unanimous approval to a proposed constitutional amendment that would permit both the states and Congress to regulate or ban abortion The proposed states rights amendment sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah was the second piece of antiabortion legislation approved by a judiciary subcommittee The first supported by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina defining life as starting at conception giving a fetus constitutional rights appears to have the support of the majority of people in the antiabortion movement Charles Williamson a businessman from Bellmore the chairman of the Long Island Coalition for Life an organization that he believes represents 50000 families in Nassau Suffolk Brooklyn and Queens said that members of the coalition recently passed a resolution opposing the Hatch amendment which they believe does not go far enough In conscience we cannot support a little bit of abortion Mr Williamson said We have been fighting this too long We want to make it not legal to kill an unborn child The law of the land is quite clear according to Dr Joseph J Rovinsky the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island JewishHillside Medical CenterOnce you are born he said you have different rights than before you are born Commenting on those in the antiabortion movement Dr Rovinsky who is professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the School of Medicine at the State University at Stony Brook said They have a laudable attitude most of us do not like abortion We do not find it a delightful procedure We would prefer contraception but I think they fail to take into consideration the welfare of the patient who is already here In this world he continued people dont always do what is best for them and it is a question of should they suffer I am interested in protecting the patient not in punishing Speaking of an era when abortion was outlawed Dr Rovinsky said that there was probably a death a month in this area alone resulting from illegal abortions He said he did not think that prevention of legal abortions would necessarily drive things back to that state but he did believe that involving the teenage group with the lawenforcement authorities would only make things worse for them It is Dr Rovinskys view that if legislation prohibiting abortion should come to pass those who could afford to pay and were smart enough to show up at a physicians office early would find doctors who would perform abortions safely in the privacy of their offices Illegality he said would only drive up the price  if a doctor is taking the risk he will ask for more money Unfortunately he said teenagers do not have the money and are not astute enough to come in early So they are the ones who could b e pushed into lifethreatening situati ons
"DESPITE DIVISIONS AND CRISES, ITALY AVOIDS DISASTER",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/world/despite-divisions-and-crises-italy-avoids-disaster.html,After a century of national unity Italy is still two countries The north with its industries and technology is part of Europe  the southern tip of the Ruhr a Milanese industrialist said only half facetiously The largely rural south is part of the underdeveloped Mediterranean third world Naples and Palermo evoke Alexandria not Hamburg or Le Havre The northsouth issue is the oldest and most fundamental of Italys unresolved problems These problems are so numerous and of such variety that foreigners though not Italians often fear the ultimate catastrophe  the collapse of the countrys institutions or the breaking apart of its social fabric A cartoon in a leading French magazine some time ago showed the Italian boot spinning madly around Europe in imminent danger of being torn loose and flung either south into the third world east into the Soviet orbit or perhaps s imply into the void of outer space But the worst has never happened and probably never will  in spite of the pressures of terrorism recurrent political scandals strikes natural disasters and other afflictions Antiterrorism Effort Gains The battle against terrorism for instance seemed hopeless for a long time But last month thousands of separate police operations led to the freeing of Brig Gen James L Dozier after 42 days of captivity at the hands of the Red Brigades the countrys most powerful terrorist organization Last year 19 people were killed by political terrorists in all of Italy In the southern city of Naples last year nearly 200 people were killed in clashes between criminal gangs The south roughly defined by a line running from south of Rome to the northeastern edge of the Abruzzi region on the Adriatic includes about twofifths of Italys area and nearly half its population But it produces only onesixth of the countrys industrial goods and its unemployment is twice the national rate Between 1950 and 1970 more than four million southerners left the region about half of them for northern Italy and the rest as emigrants to northern Europe or America In the last 30 years some 50 billion has been spent for the development of the south The superhighways there are as wide as in the north but emptier There are good roads even to the remotest villages Electricity and water have been brought to most hamlets Here and there northern industrialists have built plants with government aid Aid Is Subject of Dispute Inevitably the assistance program for the south became a subject of dispute Charges of corruption are widespread Some critics say Rome has dispensed its aid as a colonial power would from the outside and the top without recognizing that emigration has robbed the region of those who could have made the investment productive Catastrophes sometimes unite a nation but this was not the case with the great earthquake that devastated most of the mountain area east of Naples 15 months ago Southerners are still bitter over the slowness of the rescue operations which they say caused hundreds of people to die unnecessarily It would have been different if the quake had struck in the north they say And in the north a visitor often hears remarks against southerners bordering on racism Some 150000 people in Naples are still homeless or living in condemned houses on the verge of collapse More than 100 schools are occupied by squatters In the suburb of Bagnoli 750 people have been living for five years in a ratinfested abandoned hotel They are among the 35000 people who were homeless in the city even before the earthquake and they say they are the real victims of the quake because all the government money that might have been spent on them is going to the new victims Unemployed Even Worse Off A quarter of the population of Naples was listed as unemployed before the quake but many of them had some income Now these people are even worse off Many of the home industries producing shoes and other goods in the narrow streets of the old city have been wiped out The contrast with the north is startling In Parma the staid northern city famous for its ham and cheese and opera house an official proudly reels off the cities with the highest average income and the lowest unemployment rate in the country They are all in the north A young music student from the south taking his first walk around Parma marvels at not seeing any poor people and at the rows of old Englishlooking stores selling cashmeres tweeds and jewelry Why is everybody here so much richer than we are he explodes They Look Down Their Noses His father explains another difference between north and south If I tried to bribe the city clerk here he would almost certainly call the policeman standing at the door so I dont try he said In Turin the city of the Fiat automobile company where half the population now consists of southerners a driver says that even though he has lived and worked in the north for 30 years he still calls Palermo in Sicily his home Of the Torinesi he says They look down their noses and dont talk to anyone A Torinese complains that the southerners have changed the city even its eating habits We used to feed broad beans to the animals now we buy them at the grocer and eat them he said Many of the problems of Italy transcend regional differences Living Well Amid Troubles One of Italys puzzling contradictions is that the economy is going through the worst crisis in a generation but many millions of Ita lians  probably even a majority  have ne ver lived better The rate of inflation was over 20 percent last year though it has declined recently Unemployment is 84 percent and still growing But the restaurants are full of people eating well and expensively The superb highways are full of cars despite a succession of steep increases in the price of gas Parts of the state sector which accounts for 40 percent of the gross national product are reported to be near bankruptcy But many small industries are thriving quietly adapting to the fluctuating prices changing tastes and technological innovations on the world market These businesses are often misleadingly  lumped together as the submerged economy because some avoid union contracts taxes and other state restrictions Giovanni Spadolini the first Prime Minister in 36 years who is not a Christian Democrat has said that his biggest problem is to cure the illness of false affluence By that he means the high spending by individuals and the state combined with low productivity and steeply rising costs in the factories Terrorism the Worst Scourge Despite the endemic problems of the economy and the division of the nation the worst scourge has been terrorism A year ago Gen Umberto Cappuzzo then commander of the Carabinieri the paramilitary police said the worst of the terrorism was over operationally speaking But soon afterward Pope John Paul II was wounded by a gunman and this year General Dozier an American assigned to NATO was abducted But General Cappuzzo may have been more right than wrong General Dozier was the first captive of the Red Brigades to be freed by security forces since 1975 The police who for years had found it impossible to infiltrate the terrorist organizations have now accumulated a store of valuable information from captured prisoners Politically the terrorists have failed to achieve their goals The civil war they had announced did not take place and the armed party they wanted to create has not taken shape The terrorists  both those of the extreme left and the extreme right  no longer appear to have an appreciable political following Active Mostly in North The terrorists have been active almost exclusively in the north The Red Brigades have their roots in the student movement of the late 1960s For instance Renato Curcio the dominant figure among the founders came from a middleclass Roman Catholic background in the north and moved from campus radicalism to revolutionary action and ultimately to violence after living among striking farm workers in the south The terrorists of the extreme right also came from northern cities In the south there has been only one major local terrorist organization the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei which operated from Naples for a few years in the early 70s One reason for its failure was that the rackets and the Mafia were too solidly entrenched and would not tolerate a third underground The Red Brigades occasionally ventured into Naples but never for long Perhaps the biggest single mistake of the Red Brigades was the kidnapping and killing in 1978 of Aldo Moro a respected politician who had been Prime Minister five times The Italian Establishment  the Government political parties the press  was slow to react but gradually it mobilized against the terrorists At the start of the Moro affair many Italians saw the terrorists as a modern version of Robin Hood but afterward public sympathy for them sharply declined Now the rescue of General Dozier is widely regarded as a national victory Policemen not normally admired in this country have become heroes and in Padua where General Dozier was freed a crowd was ready to lynch his kidnappers Students Become Apolitical The mood among Italian students has also changed over the last decade The overwhelming majority of them seem to have withdrawn from active politics We dont even talk about politics one student said There have been no political marches in years other than last falls parades against nuclear weapons that were a European phenomenon In Rome and Parma students and professors say the only two organizations really active on the two campuses are Catholic lay groups run by young priests who wear civilian clothes operate dining halls and sometimes say mass The League of Young Communists the youth branch of the Communist Party had 120000 members four years ago last year it had 60000 having lost 20000 each year Students cite indifference and disillusionment as the reasons for young peoples flight from politics Universities Overcrowded The universities are as overcrowded as ever  In Rome there are 130000 students in buildings built half a ce ntury ago for 25000 Threequarters of Italys more than two milli on unemployed are in their 20s or teens and many of them have ne ver had a job Italians as a whole normally highly politicized seem to have lost much of their interest in party politics and are more cynical than ever about most of their politicians This has hurt the dominant Christian Democrats For the first time in years the political center is gaining ground Bettino Craxi the Socialist leader wants to succeed Mr Spadolini as prime minister But he also wants to build around his party a national third force that would change the countrys political lineup by presenting a viable centrist alternative to the Christian Democrats and the Communists for the first time since the war Christian Democrats Suffer The Christian Democrats have suffered a sharp loss of public esteem They have been governing the country alone or at the head of shifting alliances since the end of World War II and some of their leading figures have been involved in a score or so of political and financial scandals Now the partys era of power may be nearing its end The Communists have been paralyzed and traumatized by the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the situation in Poland After an agonizing internal debate they have now practically repudiated their ideological link with Moscow Moscow has accused them of blasphemy and last month virtually excommunicated them The break may have major political consequences in Italy The Communists are apt to lose some of their voters the old rankandfile members for whom Moscow remained the source of all wisdom But the party is likely to pick up new more liberated voters Church Loses Influence The Roman Catholic Church long a pivotal power in Italy has lost much of its political influence in recent years and this too is hurting the Christian Democrats who have always been close to the church The Polish Pope John Paul II with his worldwide concerns has shown little interest in and no flair for Italian politics The Christian Democratic leaders who were the personal friends of past Popes have not been received by him John Paul intervened publicly in Italian politics only once and then it was a disaster During a referendum campaign last spring he repeatedly urged Italians to vote for repeal of the countrys liberal abortion law The voters including most practicing Catholics ignored his advice and voted overwhelmingly to retain the law Clergymen and Christian Democrats say that the Pope had been warned this was a hopeless fight and that it was wrong to engage the prestige of the church and the party
"NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN,MARK II",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/us/north-carolina-republicanmark-ii.html,One of the first things you notice about Senator John P Easts office is the big picture of Jesse Helms The photo shows Senator Helms flanked by Senator East and two other men and it is the only political picture on the wall That is unusual by Capitol Hill decorating standards But then the relationship between Senator Helms and Senator East who are both North Carolina Republicans is unusual It was taken the day after I was elected Mr East said of the picture the other day Thats Tom Ellis with us Hes chairman of Senator Helmss Congressional Club After one year in the Senate Mr Easts political identity has remained inextricably entwined with that of Senator Helms the powerful Southern conservative who picked him for his Senate seat On Capitol Hill Mr East who is confined to a wheelchair because of polio is even known jokingly as Helms on Wheels Its Clever He Says Its clever Mr East said of the nickname Im a great admirer of Senator Helms To the extent they wish to compare me to him Im complimented It was Senator Helms who encouraged John East in 1980 a relatively unknown college professor from eastern North Carolina to run for the Senate It was the Helms Congressional Club that got Mr East elected It was the Helms abortion bill that gave Mr East a wellpublicized topic for his first set of subcommittee hearings Mr Helms often discusses policy with his protege whose Senate votes not surprisingly usually mirror his On more than one controversial issue Mr Helms and his disciple have labored in isolation When Caspar W Weinberger was nominated for Secretary of Defense the two men were the only Senate opponents prompting one North Carolina newspaper to publish a cartoon picturing Senator Helms with a No stamp in his hand and Senator East with a Ditto stamp He Is Not Worried But if Mr East is worried about being viewed as Charlie McCarthy to Mr Helmss Edgar Bergen he is not letting on I feel over time that I shall develop my own identity he said the other day sitting behind his desk Neither a smile nor a chuckle cracked Mr Easts severe demeanor as he spoke gazing out the window If one were to look for sharp demarcations of policy he continued thats not going to happen We might disagree on tactics but not on the general ends and goals Have he and Senator Helms ever had any disagreements Im not aware of any Yet their styles are sharply differfent Mr Helms is a savvy political pro well versed in the ways of Capitol Hill Mr East is more cerebral and less experienced In the pursuit of his own agenda he has stepped on some sensitive Senatorial toes Publicly no one wants to be quoted criticizing the junior Senator from North Carolina But privately some Senators and staff members have characterized Mr East and a few other new right freshmen as at times rigid and uncompromising Mr East says that is nonsense I look upon myself as being a part of the change in government that was brought about in November 1980 he said Im not here to see bill X Y or Z passed You are part of a whole One has to understand that and be modest in ones assessment Youre going to lose your perspective in my judgment if you focus on a specific proposal Yet Senator East found himself in trouble in one of his first judicial acts last spring when as chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on separation of powers he scheduled hearings on Senator Helmss antiabortion bill which he strongly supports The problem the original witness list included only people who agreed with Senator East Senator Max Baucus of Montana the ranking minority member was so upset with that and other elements of Senator Easts handling of the hearings that he distributed a threepage press release criticizing Mr Easts performance Senator East later relented and scheduled additional hearings with an evenly balanced witness list But another important colleague Senator Orrin Hatch Republican of Utah privately criticized Mr East sharply Although Senator Hatch agreed with the Mr Easts goals in principle he questioned the constitutionality of both the Helms abortion bill and the East antibusing bill on which Senator East held hearings later in the year Senator East further ruffled feathers last year by commenting at a news conference in North Carolina on the problems of two of his Congressional colleagues Asked about questions raised by Senator Thomas F Eagleton and Representative Frederick W Richmond about Federal tobacco price supports which Senator East favors he noted that Senator Eagleton Democrat of Missouri dropped out of the 1972 Presidential race because it turned out he had mental problems Uproar Follows This An uproar ensued and Mr East wrote a twopage letter explaining to Mr Eagleton that he had been quoted out of context Of Mr Richmond Mr East said at the same news conference I think when a man is under a court order because of dropped charges on a criminal prosecution it tells you something possibly about the character of the individual Mr Richmond Democrat of Brooklyn was arrested in 1978 and charged with soliciting sexual relations with a man and a 16yearold youth Mr Richmond admitted that the incidents had occurred and the charge was dismissed after he agreed to get professional treatment While Mr East has stirred controversy in the Senate on these and other incidents his colleagues give him high marks for being bright and capable Despite his handicap Mr East has compiled one of Senates best attendance records missing only 25 of the nearly 500 recorded votes in the Senate in his first year And he is apparently learning the ways of the Senate in other respects In subsequent hearings of Senator Easts subcommittee Senator Baucus and his staff have been invited to select half the witnesses

review a trial court decision to take a 3yearold white boy away from his white mother after she gave birth to a child by a black man The decision means that arguments will be scheduled as soon as an appeal is filed by lawyers for the mother Kathy Blackburn Mrs Blackburn who is 26 years old and divorced is seeking to regain custody of her son Nickolas from her former motherinlaw Nancy Blackburn 51 Both women live in Millen an East Georgia town of 3700 people The custody dispute has drawn a number of briefs as friends of the court from groups concerned with civil liberties abortion and racial discrimination Mrs Blackburn was given custody of her son after her divorce from Mark E Blackburn on July 17 1979 On May 13 1981 she gave birth to a second child Jennifer who is half black Shift of Custody to Grandmother On June 25 Judge Faye Martin of the Jenkins County Superior Court signed a temporary order placing Nickolas in the care of his paternal grandmother Nancy Blackburn After hearings Oct 9 and Nov 2 Judge WC Hawkins of the Superior Court gave permanent custody of the boy to the grandmother The judge cited clear and convincing evidence that Kathy Blackburn had failed to provide adequate supervision moral guidance and medical attention and has given birth to an illegitimate female child Although Judge Hawkinss order did not mention race the appeal and supporting briefs said that the decision was discriminatory because it made no finding as to unfitness as a mother to Jennifer The Georgia Right to Life Committee an antiabortion group said in its brief that if Judge Hawkins found sufficient ground to take Nickolas away from his mother he should also have taken Jennifer away The committee said that if the decision was left standing it would encourage abortions Briefs in support of Kathy Blackburn were filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia the Womens Legal Defense Fund of Washington and jointly by the Georgia General Assemblys Legislative Black Caucus and the Southern Poverty Law Center  Mother Works at Chicken Factory MILLEN Ga Feb 17 AP  At the Billy Crider Poultry plant 25 miles from here Kathy Blackburn is paid 340 a nickel over the minimum wage to reach into 1411 chickens an hour and pull their entrails out Three miles away in the farmhouse Nickolas Blackburn now calls home his grandparents Nancy and Bowie Blackburn go about the business of rearing another child Asked if he wants to go back to his mother Nickolas toddling from one new toy to another says no Kathy Blackburn contends that her motherinlaw sought custody of Nickolas because she did not want him growing up with his halfsister Jennifer But Nancy Blackburn a 51yearold bookkeeper contends that she considered a custody fight long before her daughterinlaw became pregnant Mark Blackburn Kathys former husband has remarried and moved to Augusta He has stayed out of the fight Judge Hawkins of Superior Court says that he took Nickolas away because the boys mother had neglected him The judge said he had not considered the mothers interracial relationship The issue of race was raised by Nancy Blackburns lawyer in the petition for change of custody It cited the birth of an illegitimate racially mixed child The only other time the issue arose was at the hearing when Kathy Blackburns lawyer accused Nancy Blackburn of wanting custody because you dont want the child being reared around blacks Judge Hawkins said That hasnt got a thing to do with this case This court is colorblind Talks Freely Outside Court Despite his warning the judge talks freely outside the court Let me ask you a question he says How would you like to have a female relative living with a black man and having a child I personally am opposed to it He says Millen is not ready for that sort of integration Kathy Blackburn arrived here three years ago with her husband and monthold son She came east after studying to become a chef at a vocational school in her native Minneapolis She met Mark Blackburn an electrician at the restaurant in Meriden Conn where she worked Six months later they were married When Nickolas was born Mr Blackburn was unemployed and the marriage was foundering At his parents urging they came to Georgia In Millen Mr Blackburn found work at an electrical plant and his wife at the hospital But in July 1979 they were divorced and Judge Hawkins granted the wife custody Kathy Blackburn moved to a trailer then a motel room and finally to Millen Villa a Federally subsidized complex of 32 apartments whose tenants are mainly black

HUMAN LIFE BILL'S LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/opinion/l-human-life-bill-s-limit-249415.html,To the Editor A Feb 8 Times editorial refers to a bill to define abortion as murder and deny Federal courts and the Supreme Court the power to say the contrary I am intrigued for I know of no such bill I am of course familiar with the HelmsHyde Human Life Bill S 158 which states The Congress finds that the life of each human being begins at conception But this declaration of fact hardly makes abortion murder As the report of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers states S 158 will not make abortion murder because it does not even make abortion a crime The Human Life Bill contains a provision restricting the power of lower Federal courts to interfere with any antiabortion laws that might be passed by state or municipal bodies  but it also provides for expedited review of any such matter by the Supreme Court As the subcommittee report puts it S 158 does not oppose judicial review rather it invites immediate judicial review DOUGLAS JOHNSON Legislative Director National Right to Life Committee Washington Feb 8 1982
U.S. ISSUES RULE ON WARNING PARENTS ON BIRTH-CURB AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/us/us-issues-rule-on-warning-parents-on-birth-curb-aids.html,The Reagan Administration today formally issued a rule that would require parents to be notified whenever children under the age of 18 received oral contraceptives or prescription birthcontrol devices from family planning clinics using Federal funds The proposed rule would apply to intrauterine devices and diaphragms as well as to birthcontrol pills since all three require a doctors prescription Clinics would have to notify a parent or guardian in 10 days after dispensing contraceptives to a person 17 or under A clinic would have to verify receipt of notice before giving more prescription drugs or devices to the same youth President Reagan was asked about a new contraceptive policy at his news conference Thursday His answer rejected suggestions that the policy was an intrusion by the Government into the private lives of young people Those young people couldnt get their appendix taken out without their parents permission he said The Government he went on has no business injecting itself between parent and child in a family relationship and where it is very definitely a problem of concern to parents who are responsible for the children The proposal is to be published Monday in the Federal Register the official bulletin of Government rulemaking activities Members of the public will have 60 days to comment on it The Department of Health and Human Services must consider the comments before issuing any final regulation The department said that parents have a direct and legitimate concern in participating in a decision that may have longterm health consequences for their children In prefatory material it said that the requirement of notice by familyplanning clinics would give parents the opportunity to take part in such decisions Eve W Paul vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said today that the federation would file a challenge if the rule was adopted in its present form She said it would go beyond the intent of Congress and infringe on the constitutional right of privacy by forcing young people to give up their right to have confidential access to contraceptive services Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services said The Government should not construct a Berlin Wall between parents and children The family he said should be the focal point for dealing with the problems of sexual activity and pregnancy among teenagers Representative James H Scheuer Democrat of Brooklyn denounced the proposal as representing Big Brother government at its worst The Administration talks of getting the Government off peoples backs he continued but what they really intend is to get Government into peoples bedrooms These regulations will only result in an increase in illegitimate births and abortions because many of these young people will be afraid to seek advice from family planning clinics if they know their parents will be informed Under the rule the clinics would not notify parents if notice would result in physical harm to the young person The exception is meant to apply to cases where there is evidence of a history of child abuse sexual abuse or incest Alfred F Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City said that the proposed Federal rule would reverse a policy that has been in effect in New York State for at least 10 years That policy he said was to encourage but not require parental involvement in the provision of family planning services The policy has paid tangible dividends reducing the rate of teen pregnancy he said Only 13 percent of all births in New York State are to teenagers and thats one of the lowest rates in the country The proposal would also change the definition of lowincome family making it more difficult for some young people to obtain free birthcontrol services People wishing to comment on the proposal may do so by sending their views to Marjory Mecklenburg Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs Room 725H 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington DC 20201  Two Reagan Vetoes Found Special to the New York Times SACRAMENTO Calif Feb 19 President Reagan could have had two bills in mind when he mentioned a veto cast as Governor of California a search of state files indicates Mr Reagan was asked about a proposal to require notice to parents of minors receiving familyplanning assistance He replied that I vetoed a bill that was contrary to what I believed in while I was Governor of California and said the bill was on that subject The California Senate Journal shows two such vetoes by Governor Reagan On Sept 20 1970 Mr Reagans veto message on Senate Bill 542 said The bill provides that a female minor may give consent to the furnishing of hospital medical and surgical care related to the prevention of pregnancy without requiring consent by her parents This bill could be construed to permit a minor girl to consent to a sterilization without her parents knowledge or consent On Dec 20 1971 a veto message on Senate Bill 375 said This bill would permit a minor to obtain medical care related to the use fitting and dispensing of contraceptive devices or drugs without parental consent Approval of Senate Bill 375 would remove parental consent for care related to the prevention of pregnancy for all those under age 18  a group that includes thousands of persons who actually are still children in every sense
NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/nyregion/new-jersey-journal.html,THE new Speaker of the Assembly Alan J Karcher Democrat of Sayreville will have a rather unusual legislative aide working for him tomorrow a candidate for the United States Senate But for the aide Howard Rosen a Millburn lawyer its just one more job Since last June Mr Rosen who is seeking the Democratic nomination has been spending one day a week working  for no pay  at a garden variety of occupations all over the state He calls this his workday program and he has been doing it he says to get to know the people and prepare to be a good Senator With a target of 100 workdays Mr Rosen has had 28 jobs so far most of them bluecollar Among other things he has picked watermelons on a farm in Vineland done construction work in Woodbridge been on an assembly line in South Hackensack made chocolate Easter eggs in Westville packed pharmaceuticals for HoffmanLaRoche in Clifton and made salads in a Plainfield steakhouse called Whats Your Beef And what Mr Rosen has done on the job  besides putting in his days work  has been to ask his fellow workers what their beefs were The message he says has been clear and consistent People throughout New Jersey are feeling the harsh impact of the recession and expect things to get worse he says They dont want tax shelters they just want to put groceries on the table have a home of their own and a secure retirement plan His worst job Mr Rosen recalled was taking tickets at a merrygoround in Asbury Park last August The calliope was so loud that he couldnt talk  a political candidates nightmare His best job Doing construction labor because it really tested him Ive been sitting behind a desk for 30 years the 53yearold Mr Rosen said I didnt know if I could cut it I did but I sure felt it that night Mr Rosens regular workdays are spent in his Newark law office Although he has never run for elective public office before he is no newcomer to public life He was among other things a deputy state attorney general from 1955 to 1958 finance chairman of the state Democratic Party in 1975 a member of the Professional Ethics Committee of the State Supreme Court from 1978 to 1981 a delegate to the United Nations in 1979 a board member of the New Jersey League for Conservation Legislation in 1981 and president from 1978 to 1981 of the New Jersey Committee for Responsible Legislature which encourages good political candidates to run for office Why didnt he run for office before Too expensive while youre raising children Mr Rosen said Now that they are grown they are 22 25 and 28 years old he added I can afford to run for the Senate In the Democratic field with Mr Rosen so far are former Representative Andrew Maguire of Ridgewood Cyril Yannerelli a Paterson Councilman and Passaic County Freeholder and Frank Lautenberg of Franklin Lakes chief executive officer of the Automatic Data Processing Company On the Republican side are Representative Millicent Fenwick of Bernardsville and Jeffrey Bell the 1978 Republican Senate candidate The sexeducation battle is rearing its head again this time in the courts Several weeks ago Joseph Shanahan a Lambertville lawyer representing the Coalition of Concerned Parents argued before the State Supreme Court that the statemandated familylife education curriculum violated religious freedom and was thus unconstitutional All schools are required to have a familylife curriculum in place by September 1983 Mr Shanahan says that teaching sex education in school violates separation of church and state by undermining religious beliefs taught at home The legal argument he used to make his point was based ironically on the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision in Rowe v Wade which legalized abortions and is referred to as the righttoprivacy standard Mr Shanahan argued that if women were granted the right to abortion  the right to privacy over their own bodies  then by the same token the states endorsement of discussions by students on the pros and cons of being sexually active was an inhibition of their religious practices taught at home specifically inhibiting the right of privacy between parents and children Another element of Mr Shanahans argument dealt with a clause in the mandate that states that parents who do not wish their children to participate in parts of the curriculum may withdraw them from classes His argument was based on another United States Supreme Court decision Abington School District v Schempp 1963 but turned on its ear The case involved prohibiting school prayers The argument raised in that litigation was that children whose parents objected to school prayers could leave the room The Supreme Court held that this did not change the obligatory nature of the prayers On the same constitutional basis the pressure on these kids in this situation the familylife mandate will be the same Mr Shanahan asserts Regarding his twist of plucking the two cases to hoist liberals by their own petard he said When you make a sword expect it to be used against you However Mary Ann Burgess an assistant attorney general representing the State Board of Education says that Mr Shanhan by imposing what is to be taught in school by imposing his religion in the schools is trying to mix church and state She likened his argument to the recent creationismasscience battle in Arkansas in which a Federal court decided against the creationism proponents The State Supreme Court decision on familylife education is expected to be handed down in two to three weeks Meanwhile a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Marie S Muhler Republican of Freehold that last May fell only five votes short of killing the mandate has been reintroduced And Assemblyman Joseph D Patero Democrat of Manville has introduced a second similar bill in the Assembly Also Wayne Dumont Jr Republican of Phillipsburg has introduced parallel legislation in the Senate What weighed 12926 pounds and then did a disappearing act during between April 1980 and July 1981 Extra poundage from 380 patients in a weightloss program at West Essex General Hospital in Livingston thats what The outpatient clinic is directed by Dr A Donald Angeletti an endocrinology and metabolism specialist whose patients 17 to 65 years old take part in weekly individual and group sessions supervised by him a nurse and two dieticians Most of the patients are uppermiddleclass bored housewives with children who are in school or grown up Of the 380 patients in the programs first 18 months 297 were women According to Dr Angeletti those enrolled in the program use food as a tranquilizer As he put it A lot get up in the middle of the night to eat We call them closet eaters They eat very little during regular meals Theyll even go into the garbage so that their families wont know And these are people who are very well off The program works through behavior modification  substituting good behavior for bad You may eat when you get on the phone and talk to your mother because the phone is next to the refrigerator Dr Angeletti said The solution may be to move the phone to another room Weightloss patients are put on a 300caloriesaday supplement made from egg albumin egg white and sucrose sugar However they also are reintroduced to regular food as quickly as possible because says Dr Angeletti they must learn how to deal with food The average weight loss is 34 pounds and usual participation in the clinic is 10 weeks The cost is 400 for six weeks then 100 a month thereafter Many heartdisease patients are referred to the weightloss program by cardiologists because their obesity would make them bad risks for cardiac surgery However Dr Angeletti faults insurance companies for not paying for the treatment of obesity the reason being that they do not consider it a disease Which is wrong he said because after years of overweight people wind up on kidney machines or with strokes heart attacks and diabetes The insurance companies end up paying for the complications from the obesity but not for treating the initiating factor Trouble is still brewing between Guardian Angels in Newark and Essex County officials Outraged by grand jury findings backing the Newark Police Department in the Dec 30 slaying of Frank Melvin an Angel patrol leader the organization is saying that the county grand jury system was rigged against them Said Curtis Sliwa national leader of the Angels We predicted the results of the investigation the day it was announced that it would be conducted by George Schneider the Essex County Prosecutor In no way could he present an unbiased account since he was the legal representative of the Fraternal Order of Police the Newark police officers union several years ago Mr Schneider while saying that the case called for a thorough investigation charged that it didnt need the attending publicity and chaos caused by the reckless and irresponsible accusations made by Sliwa Mr Sliwa maintains that a police officer had shot Mr Melvin deliberately Copies of the Prosecutors files in the case are now in the hands of Hunt Dumont the United States Attorney for New Jersey The fact that a civilian was gunned down by a policeman gives rise to investigation of a possible civil rights complaint Mr Dumont said
SEX EDUCATION DEBATED ANEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/nyregion/sex-education-debated-anew.html,LINDENHURST TEN years ago the controversy surrounding the teaching of sex education in public schools played to packed houses at school board meetings all over the Island That controversy is being revived in Lindenhurst Faced they say with statistics reflecting an alarming increase in the incidence of teenage pregnancy abortion and venereal disease school officials contend that it is incumbent upon them to include a 14lesson section on sex education within the regular health course offered for juniors and seniors at Lindenhurst High School The proposed course was recently approved by a 54 vote of the school board Although attendance at the sexeducation classes would be voluntary and only with parental permission Antonio Pope the School Superintendent said there had been a reaction that could only be described as haywire from a segment of the community Theyre trying to get the board to change its mind Mr Pope said They feel their children will be subtly pressured into taking the course even if the parents dont want it Sex is a treasured delicate aspect of our lives given us by God countered Charles Mailloux a steadfast opponent of the planned course Sex cannot be taught without presenting the moral concepts of right and wrong and the school has told us they cannot teach which values are right and which are wrong Mr Mailloux and his wife Carol were instrumental in forming Taxpayers for Responsible Education a group whose sole purpose is to eliminate the planned sexeducation class Though the organization has only about 25 members some of whom do not have children of high school age they say they have garnered widespread support throughout the community They expect at least 100 protesters to turn out at a school board meeting planned for early March In anticipation of that meeting Taxpayers for Responsible Education is distributing literature that both outlines and decries the sexeducation course The groups representatives will discuss their side of the controversy on a radio talk show tomorrow morning on the Babylonbased radio station WGLI School board members declined an invitation to participate in the broadcast The objectors are not members of the Moral Majority but they have enlisted the aid of Sharon Hodder Suffolk County chairman for the Moral Majority Mrs Hodder compiled a folder of statistics and data sympathetic to the opponents cause but the school board refused to listen to their presentation because she is not a resident of the Lindenhurst School District Specifically the critics have expressed concern that the sexeducation course will be based on the concepts of Planned Parenthood and will advocate conception and abortion both of which they strongly condemn They contend that such teaching will increase sexual activity among teenagers They seem to think our teaching about contraception means we approve of premarital sex and promiscuity Mr Pope said According to the assistant superintendent Harry Burggraf the course is designed along guidelines set forth by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Mr Burggraf said that only one class session would be devoted to discussion of contraception and that there would be no mention of abortion unless it was brought up by the students What really bothers me is that they seem to want sex taught only in what they refer to as a Christianlike manner  almost as if they want a priest to teach it Mr Burggraf said Whats more they feel they have a right to decide what other peoples children can and cannot study Its an assault on the traditional JudeoChristian morality responded Dorothy Grover of the Taxpayers for Responsible Education and we have gathered support from every denomination According to Mrs Grover a Lindenhurst High School graduate whose youngest child is 26 years old the course represents the beginning of decadence in the village She believes it is a mistake for the school to teach sex education without interpreting what is right and wrong for the students You cannot disassociate sex and morality Mrs Grover said The opponents also object to the proposed teaching method which will include peergroup discussions According to Carol Mailloux many students will feel pressure to conform to whatever their peer group deems acceptable behavior She and her husband said such matters were best left to parental guidance Theyve moved into the sanctuary of the family Charles Mailloux said He said the school board had rejected his proposal that parents and children attend sexeducation courses together during afterschool or evening hours

No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/style/no-headline-249976.html,A new word has entered Spains political vocabulary La Ministra Last December in an otherwise unimaginative Cabinet shuffle Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo startled his countrymen by naming a woman to his Cabinet After some consulting of dictionaries it was decided that his choice to head the Ministry of Culture Soledad Becerril y Bustamante de Atienza was a ministra distinct from the 17 male ministros in the Cabinet Only once before in Spanish history had a woman made it into what has traditionally been an exclusive mens club  Federica Montseny an anarchist became Health Minister at the outbreak of civil war in 1936  but Mr Calvo Sotelo may wish he had a few more women like Mrs Atienza in his Cabinet The 37yearold Culture Minister has turned out to be a captivating television personality her press secretary inundated with almost 300 requests for interviews pleads with the staterun television to limit her appearances fearful of overexposure But facing decisive elections in southern Andalusia in May the Government and the ruling Union of the Democratic Center have fully exploited her star image At the end of January she was given yet another post president of the UCD as the governing party is known in Andalusia As such she will lead the partys uphill campaign in the south She is in some ways an improbable figure in the fastmoving world of Spanish politics where opportunism and aggressiveness abound A patrician and an intellectual Mrs Atienza has a reputation among colleagues for being as one Seville politician put it very serious very serious  maybe a little too serious Ensconced in her gigantic office on La Castellana Madrids main northsouth axis the minister sounded serious enough about her new job but nicely ironic about some of the pomposities that surround it I have the impression she said propping up a foot on a low table that we in Spain are not yet convinced of the importance that culture has Culture  she turned the word over slowly in Spanish  culture finally produces a certain kind of behavior A people that has a high cultural level can at the same time appreciate an El Greco or understand restrictive measures on things like gasoline or energy It is a people that knows how to meet challenges The RibbonCutting Distracts The 16000 bureaucrats in the Ministry of Culture concern themselves with everything from the dilapidated state of the Prado museum to the wellbeing of Spanish soccer teams and its top job has in the past been something of a dumping ground for politicians in need of a Cabinetlevel position Mrs Atienza seems inclined to bring the focus back to such things as help for the theater and the film industry but she finds herself caught up in a lot of ribboncutting whisked around in a policeescorted limousine to expositions museums and restored cathedrals I think when I go she mused wryly  What are the people who will stay behind thinking the people who have prepared everything so well for when the ministra comes Youre looking at something and then somebody pulls you on the jacket and says We have to go Everything has been laboriously readied The ministra arrives she hardly has time to look to say hello to smile And then the car and the police  bbrrrrm  and out we go running This oppresses me And I think that the people will be thinking That imbecile where is she going  I would always like to stay three times longer she continued I think it is very important to listen to people so that the citizens feel that those who govern them are close to them Mrs Atienza got into politics in the last years of the Franco dictatorship A native of Madrid she had graduated in philology from Madrid University and done graduate work in linguistics in England and studied political science at Columbia University in New York Like many others she concluded that an opening to democracy in Spain was imperative and in 1974 after moving to Seville founded a political magazine for Andalusia La Ilustracion Regional But while many young activists drifted almost instinctively to the clandestine Communist and Socialist parties she hewed to a classic liberal position I have the conviction that the championing of freedom and the dignity and rights of the person is not a patrimony of the left or of socialism she said What I want for my country is something that is defended in Western Europe by parties that are not socialist In the first expectant years after Francos death in 1975 she joined a small group of likeminded liberals who later merged with the newborn Union of the Democratic Center In the 1977 parliamentary elections she ran on the UCD ticket from Seville and was elected she was handily returned to her parliamentary seat in 1979 Mrs Atienzas ministerial job has forced some wrenching changes in her private life She is married to Rafael Atienza a witty and wellread Seville insurance executive who a year ago inherited the title Marques de Salvatierra As her husband travels two days a week to Madrid Mrs Atienza decided to move their children Soledad 8 and Gaspar 6 from their home in Sevilles intimate Barrio de Santa Cruz to an impersonal apartment on the ninth floor of the ministry An apartment in Madrid is a normal ministerial perk Instead of roaming freely around Seville related Mrs Atienza Soledad and Gaspar are glued to the television in Madrid amuse themselves by riding up and down in the ministerial elevator and are reluctantly carted off to an unfamiliar school in a chauffeurdriven car The whole family occasionally rallies in Seville on weekends Asked about feminism in Spain Mrs Atienza said In general Spanish woman has felt and continues to feel herself directed and dominated by the man  not dominated in the pejorative sense but rather conducted by the man Even at the hour of voting the number of women who vote as their husbands tell them is very high Profound Changes for Women Even so the minister sees profound changes in the last few years particularly as a result of a mutualconsent divorce bill passed in 1981 and reform of the antiquated civil code that gives wives greater rights within marriage itself She is against abortion and created a political stir just after she was named to her post when she was quoted as having said she didnt know anyone who was in favor of abortion She says she was misquoted Yes I know people who defend the legalization of abortion she said But I doubt if there are many people who are favorable to the fact of abortion itself  something that is a human drama Mrs Atienza believes that only education will gradually open new opportunities for Spanish women who have already begun to move into professional and technical university faculties that used to be as exclusively male as the government The government yes is a government of men city halls are places where 90 percent of the people are men she said Businesses are in the hands of men the universities in general are in mens hands This will take longer In the meantime Mrs Atienza said she is content to have arrived at the ministry happy that other women can feel content that a road has been opened But she added with some firmness if I make mistakes or blunders I dont want anyone making judgments about the capacity of women
ELECTION CHALLENGE LEADING TO A TRIAL NEITHER SIDE WANTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/nyregion/election-challenge-leading-to-a-trial-neither-side-wants.html,IN a rare case growing out of an election campaign a Bethpage antiabortion activist is scheduled to be tried next month in Nassau County Court on charges of perjury and electionlaw violations Neither side the defendant nor the Nassau District Attorneys office wants the confrontation But neither appears ready to bend The case is also significant because it dramatically focuses on longtroublesome issues involving insurgents attempting to get on the ballot in the face of challenges by the regular political organization on the intricacies deliberately set up some say  of the state election law and its candidatequalifying procedures and on questionable signatures on candidatedesignating petitions These issues arise every year particularly in primaries but rarely do they show up in a criminal court John T Cains path to the court began with his attempt to challenge in the 1980 Republican primary the renomination of State Senator Ralph J Marino of Muttontown who coincidentally has been campaigning for a position on the Republican state ticket this year Mr Cain a New York City teacher the father of four and an activist in the antiabortion movement switched from the Right to Life Party to the Republican Party in November 1979 only three months after he had transferred from the Republican Party to the Right to Life Party He said the final change came in anticipation of a primary challenge of Mr Marino Needing 1000 signatures of enrolled Republicans to qualify for the primary Mr Cain collected 550 signatures himself while his supporters gathered 750 for a total of 1300  not usually a very safe margin against regular organization challenges The challenge inevitably came First the Board of Elections dominated by the Democratic and Republican organizations and then Supreme Court Justice Vincent R Balletta Jr invalidated Mr Cains petitions on two grounds  that his last change of party enrollment the preceding fall would not be legally effective for the 1980 elections and that his petitions were permeated with fraud a common term in electionlaw cases Justice Balletta a Republican had lost an Assembly seat in 1970 as a result of opposition by antiabortion forces but this point was not raised in the election proceedings During the Supreme Court hearing Mr Cain was shown petitions that he had witnessed and was asked if he had witnessed every signature He said several times that he had Senator Marino and the Republican organization then produced a handwriting expert and individual signers who testified that in several cases husbands or wives had signed for each other without the others presence Mr Cain in his testimony volunteered the case of a son signing for four other members of his family The total of questionable signatures was about 30 and that became the basis for the permeated with fraud decision by Justice Balletta An electionlaw expert Harold L Fisher of Brooklyn said the usual procedure in such husband and wife cases was to invalidate the signatures in question rather than the entire election petition But Mr Cains testimony  not the disputed signatures  and Justice Ballettas referral of the testimony to the District Attorney became the basis for the charge of perjury a felony Conviction could cost Mr Cain his teaching job as well as a possible jail sentence Mr Cain is also charged with two related misdemeanors  making a false statement as a subscribing witness on the petitions and electionlaw misconduct in not witnessing every signature Mr Cain denied that he had deliberately lied I couldnt remember anybody not signing he said As my memory came back I began correcting what I said I volunteered five or six instances Mr Cain and his attorney A Lawrence Washburn of Manhattan who has been active in the Right to Life Party argue that husbands and wives signing petitions for each other is a common practice Indeed Mr Cain contended that in checking past petitions of Senator Marino and District Attorney Denis E Dillon at the Board of Elections he discovered numerous instances of such signatures Mr Dillon incidentally was endorsed by the Right to Life Party last year Martin Bracken the Assistant District Attorney in charge of the special investigations unit in Mr Dillons office said he sympathized with Mr Cain If I grabbed everybodys petitions including Denis Dillons Id probably find something he said This goes on all the time But Mr Bracken added I draw a big distinction between an electionlaw case and a guy getting on the stand and telling an untruth Mr Bracken said that nevertheless he had offered Mr Cain the opportunity to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with an unconditional discharge  no jail sentence or fine He said that Mr Cains conviction could eventually be expunged by a certificate for relief of civil disability Well make a martyr of this guy Mr Bracken said I want to get rid of this case Mr Cain who said he had already spent 4000 of his own money and 2500 of donated money for lawyers rejected the offer No way he said There is no truth to the charge
"THE PRESIDENCY; SAME PRIORITY, DIFFERENT STRATEGY",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/22/us/the-presidency-same-priority-different-strategy.html,A year ago White House strategists frequently fretted that Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr was sounding off too much about El Salvador and distracting attention from the Presidents top priority  the budget But on Tuesday President Reagan himself will go before the Organization of American States to deliver a major speech on the Administrations Caribbean Basin plan highlighting the importance the White House now wants to put on Latin American policy Not just on this issue but in other ways as well it is becoming clear that the Reagan political strategy for 1982 is the reverse of the strategy that the President and his advisers pursued so successfully in 1981 Last year the Reagan team constantly kept the budget at the forefront of public and Congressional attention and at the top of the Presidents personal agenda They fought off diversions from social conservatives who wanted to debate abortion or busing played down the State Departments thrust on El Salvador and deferred their own plans to dismantle the Departments of Energy and Education Different Focus But this year the President has tossed the budget initiative to Congress and stepped back to let the legislature wrestle with recordlevel deficits Meanwhile White House strategists have made plans to keep Mr Reagan in motion with speeches foreign visitors and trips around the country dealing with other issues Different year  different focus said one senior Administration official Last year we made sure that nothing else was on the schedule This year the economy is still our No 1 priority but until Congress has wrestled with the problem we cant do much As James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff put it We said last year that we would deal with the social issues after we had a year on the budget and those will be coming up now in the Senate And well have to deal with foreign policy issues that were put off last year The Caribbean initiative is part of that Actually the President is on the defensive because of the nations economic doldrums and their political repercussions Aides concede he is stalling on big economic decisions in the hope that some improvement in the economy will rescue him by summer Privately though top Administration officials acknowledge that the recession is deeper than they had thought just a month ago and that recovery is not likely until the second half of the year Western Trip Planned But on the theory that the best defense is a good offense and that the best Presidential image is an active image the White House has booked a vigorous schedule for Mr Reagan A President is supposed to lead said a top adviser  How are you going to lead and dominate the political agenda with the budget now In early March the President will make a swing out West to promote his plan to turn 40 Federal programs over to the states and two weeks later he will take his federalism sales pitch to the South In June Mr Reagan will embark on a major foreign policy trip to Europe for the Western economic summit conference in Paris a followup political summit with the leaders of the Atlantic alliance in Bonn and separate personal appearances in London and in Rome In the meantime there will be a stream of foreign visitors to Washington and constant prodding for the West Europeans to take a tougher stance on the Polish crisis Beyond that there is recurrent speculation that in this election year some Presidential advisers and troubled Republican politicians would like to see Mr Reagan go to Peking or even get together with President Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union although White House officials insist there are no plans now for such trips By summertime the Administration also hopes to put before Congress a politically saleable plan for dismantling the Department of Energy recasting the Department of Education however faces further delays In Congresss Court While the Administration is generating more action in these other areas it has so far been considerably more relaxed on the budget than in 1981 For the time being the White House has been content in Mr Bakers phrase to leave the ball in Congresss court In 1981 for example David A Stockman Director of the Office of Management and Budget and other Administration officials were so aggressive in framing legislation negotiating compromises and revising proposals that some Republicans as well as Democrats were charging that the White House was trampling on Congressional prerogatives This year the political offensive has passed very quickly to Congress Less than a week after the Reagan budget for 1983 was sent to Congress Republican leaders were at the White House telling Mr Reagan that it would not pass On Capitol Hill Republicans as well as Democrats were coming up with alternative schemes for raising taxes and curbing the growth in military spending Lacking majority support for his budget the President sees little pragmatic alternative but to keep defending it and to play for time in the hope that this will build him a majority by the time the next fiscal year begins on Oct 1 As Mr Baker acknowledged in a television appearance today the budget is not going to sail right through in a period of months More bluntly a senior official added later What were headed for is a period of stalemate But where a year ago that kind of stall would have upset the Administrations timetable and its drive for political momentum this year a strategy of delay suits the Presidents political advisers Counting on Time Mr Baker sought to explain Mr Reagans position today as viewing the budget as a twoway street and that certainly we are interested in the views and ideas of the Congress But he also warned that the President would only consider a comprehensive alternative and not piecemeal suggestions that would have the effect of changing his program The calculation of the political advisers based on surveys done by Richard Wirthlin the Presidents poll taker is that while the electorate has misgivings about the economic situation and even about the Presidents economic program most people are willing to wait and see whether the promised recovery will come And the White House is counting on time to turn the economy upward Equally important in an election year when the White House now figures the Republican Party will lose at least 12 or 13 seats to the Democrats in the House of Representatives and possibly more the party has an interest in getting Congress to share more responsibility for the budget and the fate of the economy Political strategists like Mr Baker keep emphasizing that the budget process is a joint venture with Congress Today Mr Baker predicted that Congress when it sets about facing the hard budget choices will come to the same conclusion that the President came to

MISGUIDED EFFORTS TO CURB FEDERAL COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/24/opinion/l-misguided-efforts-to-curb-federal-courts-252401.html,To the Editor There are several bills before Congress based on the premise that a simple majority of members in both houses can overturn Supreme Court decisions with which they disagree Their purpose is to nullify rulings regarding school prayers busing and abortion Our Constitution provides that it be amended by a twothirds vote of Congress and the approval of threefourths of the states The bills to limit court jurisdiction take two forms Some would strip the Federal courts of power to hear certain cases involving established constitutional rights such as separation of church and state Some would redefine terms in the Constitution such as life in an effort to reverse Supreme Court interpretations No matter how individuals feel about the decisions made by the courts in these areas the methods used to reverse them have implications beyond the individual issues The bills now in Congress are the wrong way to reverse any Supreme Court decision because the consequences would alter the foundation of our Government It is for this reason that the American Bar Association recently reaffirmed its opposition to efforts to bypass the constitutional amendment process Our system of government is based on a balance of power between the Congress the executive branch and the courts For this system to work properly the courts must be independent of the other two branches to ensure that the Congress and the Administration operate within the framework spelled out in the Constitution Under the Constitution the power to interpret the Constitution rests with the Supreme Court and not the Congress JESSE GORDON President Humanist Society of Metropolitan New York New York Feb 10 1982
Ignoring Kids With Kids,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/24/opinion/ignoring-kids-with-kids.html,Society pays a high price for adolescent childbearing Experts estimate the financial cost of the resulting dependency and welfare at more than 5 billion a year Sex counseling adoption and abortion services can help Unfortunately the proposed 1983 Federal budget makes the task of providing that kind of help more difficult Its not so much a problem of cutting as it is cutting adrift The budget would maintain the present level of spending for the next five years That obviously would represent a cut in real terms But the larger threat is that the main family planning program is to be merged into a block grant It would be left to the states to determine if the money should be spent on family planning for teenagers or something else Family planning clinics are already cutting services and staff as a result of last years reductions from 162 million to 125 million And last year Congress also removed a requirement that a proportion of funds from the Maternal and Child Health Care program and the Social Services block grants be used for such services In 1979 those programs along with Medicaid provided about half of all funds spent on family planning The block grant proposed for 1983 would lump family planning with such dissimilar programs as migrant health community health centers and blacklung disease In the scramble for funds on the state level family planning would be pitted against mine workers or mental health lobbies Whats worse political opposition is so intense in some states that they might decide not to spend anything at all for family planning Arizona for example has at long last agreed to try an experimental Medicaid program but expresssly without family planning Block grants can be sensible in the Reagan Administration they may be unavoidable But for Congress this is one block grant worth blocking Unless it ties some family planning strings to family planning funds there will be more kids with kids at a far greater cost to us all
WOMEN RECONSIDER CHILDBEARING OVER 30,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/25/garden/women-reconsider-childbearing-over-30.html,FOR women who have postponed childbearing for career building the past week brought mixed messages a Time magazine cover story celebrating the joys of motherhood after age 30 and a New England Journal of Medicine report warning that the ability to become pregnant decreases more sharply after 30 than was thought The whole thing leaves me feeling confused and depressed said a 32yearold woman expressing a common theme in interviews this week The woman said she had had three abortions and is now eager to have a child as soon as the right man appears Life is already challenging enough for professional single women in their 30s she said bitterly Now were being told By the way youre over the hill  The outlook is hardly so bleak according to gynecologists who have read the medical journal report based on a fertility study by French scientists The study found that the ability to conceive a child begins to decline at age 30 rather than 35 as had been widely assumed While not discounting the finding as a significant factor for women who plan to have children the gynecologists generally stressed that it does not justify the panicky phone calls they have been getting Yet the feeling of panic or at least urgency is very real to some judging by recent talks with 25 professional women from 28 to 35 years old married and unmarried all hoping to have a child in the future all feeling a sense of diminished options Some married women say the report has prompted them to rethink their timetables and consider childbearing now rather than a few years from now Some single women say it has encouraged them to step up the quest to get married and have a child A smaller number of single women complain that as one put it Men think baby is a fourletter word and that for the first time in their lives some of these women are giving serious thought to becoming single mothers Ive made a pact with myself said Deborah Judell who is 31 single and in public relations If I am 34 and there is no prospective mate on the scene I intend to have a child Noting that her decision was based on a sense of time running out and a conviction that she will be able to provide for a child economically and emotionally Miss Judell said I hope my stance will not be seen as defiant but Im going to do it regardless Dr Patricia Conrad a gynecologist who specializes in counseling of women beyond traditional childbearing years said she has heard from scores of anxious patients and received several requests to perform unnecessary and expensive tests on women seeking assurance that their Fallopian tubes are open They want to know that they still have that choice she said I have a feeling that a lot of women are going to get pregnant to prove it to themselves and then have second thoughts and abort They see this study as a blatant attack on their femininity Characterizing reactions to the study as an exaggeration of the problem that existed before Dr David Sherman said the question How long can I wait has taken on an urgent ring in his gynecological practice where 70 percent of the patients are career women with college degrees In the past Dr Sherman said the chief worry of women older than 35 centered on birth defects many of which can now be detected by a medical test called amniocentesis Now a lot of my patients are expressing concern that they may reach the optimum moment in their lives and not be able to get pregnant he said If this study is indeed accurate its certainly going to reshape a lot of counseling thats given patients Dr Michele Berdy a psychotherapist whose practice includes a large number of professional women in their 30s described the initial response of her patients as a mixture of panic and a sense of betrayal She said There was a feeling of being betrayed by their bodies betrayed by their gynecologists betrayed by a culture that has given a lot of support to women becoming mothers in their 30s On an emotional level Dr Berdy said the women evinced a need to deny the findings or to question the methodology of the study which involved 2193 French women who were married to sterile men and undergoing artificial insemination On a rational level she added many patients over 30 were worried about fading options and having second thoughts about the wisdom of delaying childbearing much longer This study if corroborated will definitely alter behavior Dr Berdy predicted Some of my patients cut out the newspaper article and showed it to husbands boyfriends and lovers hoping to find support While she may be ambivalent about having a child right now my sense is that he may be even more ambivalent The report is being used a evidence In an editorial in the medical journal two Yale University experts suggested that one effect of the study might be to reverse a current childbearing trend Instead of concentrating on careers in their 20s and delaying childbirth until their 3Os more women may decide on motherhood at an earlier age Thats the direct opposite of what I plan to do and its totally unrealistic said Susan Gordon a 28yearold married accountant voicing a common reaction Anyone who knows anything about the business world knows that the years between 25 and 32 are crucial I dont intend to jeopardize my career and the financial future of the children I plan to have because of a study
SECRETARY SCHWEIKER'S FLAWED PLAN TO CURB TEEN-AGE SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/opinion/l-secretary-schweiker-s-flawed-plan-to-curb-teen-age-sex-253713.html,To the Editor The regulation proposed by Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Schweiker requiring notification of parents when adolescent women receive contraception is one more example of the repressive attitudes of the current Administration he idea that this maneuver will curb teenage sexual activity is preposterous It will only result in more unplanned adolescent pregnancies and higher health risks for those young women who carry pregnancies to term Their option for terminating unexpected and lifethreatening pregnancies is of course threatened by the Administration efforts to criminalize abortion in America Despite the allegations of people opposed to reproductive choice those of us who provide abortion services would prefer not to see an increase in unplanned pregnancies and abortions among teenagers or any other group As a physician trained in public health but having provided abortion services for nearly 10 years I have seen the consequences of fear ignorance and conflicting social pressures on teenagers They need help when they ask for it not pious platitudes and the arrogant imposition of someone elses morality They need it with the same respect for personal privacy that anyone else should expect Secretary Schweikers assertion that parents should have some control over the provision of lifeendangering medications ie birthcontrol pills fails to recognize that 1 teenagers do not need or obtain parental permission to have sex and 2 pregnancy itself is far more dangerous to life and health than are birthcontrol pills especially for teenagers Finally this regulation is discriminatory against women since it does not prevent males from receiving contraceptive assistance The idea that contraceptive help promotes promiscuity among teenagers is hogwash In the first place clinical experience and studies show that teenagers overwhelmingly restrict their sexual activity on the basis of emotional relationships  if anything more than do adults Second teenagers are likely to have initiated sexual relationships long in advance of visits to familyplanning services Their visits are frequently prompted by fear or suspicion of pregnancy The availability of confidential services gives us the opportunity to practice preventive medicine and provide important information about reproductive health Bill Whites replacement as director of family planning in the Department of Health and Human Services is further evidence of the Reagan Administrations determination to reverse the last decades advances in reproductivehealth care as well as to frustrate the will of Congress Bill White is a dedicated career civil servant who has vast experience in the administration of Federal health programs His successor Marjorie Mecklenberg is an equally dedicated opponent of reproductive choice but inexperienced in health administration Her task is to kill the program Who benefits by these actions Surely not teenagers or American families The beneficiaries are politicians who run for office campaigning against sin and for motherhood The losers will be the American people WARREN M HERN MD Director Boulder Abortion Clinic Boulder Colo Feb 13 1982
FOES OF MOVE TO BAN BUSING END THEIR SENATE FILIBUSTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/us/foes-of-move-to-ban-busing-end-their-senate-filibuster.html,Senate opponents of a stringent measure against busing agreed to end their eightmonth filibuster today and passage of the legislation is now considered virtually assured next week The House has passed a bill that is less severe in restricting the use of school busing for integration Until the differences between the two versions are resolved the measure is a long way from becoming law Opponents have vowed to continue their delaying tactics and Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader said today The battle isnt over When this bill becomes law I have failed said Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican who has led the filibuster but not until then The collapse of the filibuster is clearly a victory for lawmakers who believe that busing is a colossal failure in the words of Senator Arlen Specter a Pennsylvania Republican who nonetheless supported the filibuster on the ground that the bill was unconstitutional Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana who led the fight for the bill said he was optimistic about its chances but agreed with Senator Baker that the outcome was in doubt Effect on Other Social Issues Senator Johnston said the stalling tactics would make it more difficult for Congress to consider other social issues such as abortion and school prayer before adjourning for the fall elections Quite clearly its late February he said Time is awasting The Senate bill started out last June as a simple authorization of funds for the Department of Justice Then Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina attached a rider to bar funds for busing in school integration cases This provision similar to a measure passed by the House is moot at the moment since the Reagan Administration has promised not to pursue such cases Mr Johnston then added an amendment not reflected in the House version It prohibits the Federal courts from ordering transportation of children more than 15 minutes or five miles from home It would also let the Justice Department reopen old busing cases even where the remedy has promoted integration Three times its backers succeeded in cutting off debate by invoking cloture a move that requires the vote of 60 Senators Even after the last cloture vote on Feb 9 Mr Weicker and his allies delayed final action through parliamentary maneuvers Long Session Frays Tempers The Senate remained in session until 130 oclock this morning and when debate resumed in midmorning tempers were frayed Senator Johnston accused the Senate leadership of bending over backwards in a double circle to accommodate the filibusterers Senator Baker increased the pressure on Senator Weicker who reluctantly agreed to end the filibuster and schedule a vote on the bill Tuesday At one point in the debate Mr Baker vowed We are going to finish this bill today tomorrow Saturday A few minutes later in a rollcall Senator Weicker said something under his breath to the majority leader who whirled around and retorted I told you last night youve gone too far Later their feelings were glossed over with kind words and mutual praise Liberals have long denounced the use of the filibuster by Southern conservatives to block civil rights legislation but as the political tides washed these conservatives into power in the Senate the liberals used the rules they once criticized They argue that the Johnston bill and others like it threaten the integrity of the Federal courts and have to be resisted Concern for Federal Courts I have grave reservations about the filibuster approach generally said Senator Specter but its hard to find an issue as important as the jurisdiction of the courts Accordingly the liberals have used the filibuster to focus public attention on the enormity of the issue and even Senator Johnston concedes that they have succeeded Its certainly clear he said that if we had brought the bill up eight months ago and passed it in an hour the press around the country would not have had time to become aware of it and speak about it The filibuster forces have also used the busing debate to send a message to the Senate leadership If you bring more social issues to the floor we will continue to tie up the Senate The leadership sidetracked these social issues last year while Congress dealt with President Reagans economic program The leaders have promised the conservatives a full hearing in the current session but they have heard the message from the liberals and are concerned about it I think their point has registered said Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska the Republican whip If people raise controversial issues like this theres going to be delay no question about it  Wider St Louis Plan Backed ST LOUIS Feb 25 AP  A Federal appeals court today upheld expansion into the suburbs of the decadeold St Louis school desegregation case In a 43page opinion a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth District affirmed all recent lower court rulings In addition it ordered the state to pay half the costs of desegregating city schools regardless whether private individuals or foundations had donated funds for the purpose The city that the state had underpaid it by more than 1 million last year and that the donations defrayed actual expenses About half of St Louiss 67000 students still attend predominantly black schools and city officials say there are not enough white students within city boundaries to integrate the schools The appellate judges upheld Federal District Judge William Hungates decision to add 18 predominantly white county school districts to the suit
Abortion and the Squeal Rule,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/26/opinion/abortion-and-the-squeal-rule.html,The Reagan Administration issued a rule the other day that requires federally funded family planning clinics to notify the parents of patients under 18 when their children are receiving prescription birthcontrol devices At about the same time the Alan Guttmacher Institute released its annual abortion survey In 1980 155 million legal abortions were performed in the United States Thats more than double the number performed in 1973 the first year of legalized abortions and a record Planned Parenthood which finances the Institute attributes part of the steady increase to a shift away from the birthcontrol pill and intrauterine devices The reason is usually health The Governments new squeal ruling is sure to be another Almost half the initial prescriptions for oral contraceptives among unmarried teenagers teenagers are at little risk from the pill were obtained at family planning clinics A recent study shows however that 25 percent of the clinics young patients would stop applying for prescription contraceptives if their parents were notified Only 2 percent said they would stop sexual activity That means the rest would use less effective overthecounter contraceptives  or none at all The possible result A jump in teenage pregnancies  and yet another rise in the abortion rate It would be ironic if so committed a foe of abortion as President Reagan were a cause of that 155 million abortion record being broken in 1982

LIBRARIANS WARY ON BOOK SELECTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/28/nyregion/librarians-wary-on-book-selections.html,QUESTION What do The Hotel New Hampshire by John Irving Forever by Judy Blume and Little Red Riding Hood have in common Answer They have all been targets for complaints in local libraries Although there has been no discernible trickledown effect from the Island Trees case in which the School Board in Levittown banned nine books in 1976 Long Islands librarians recently filed a friendofthecourt brief opposing the boards action The case has reached the United States Supreme Court where opening arguments will be heard on Tuesday Librarians on the Island have also geared up to handle any attempts at what they consider censorship in their libraries Though we hate to admit it I think the Moral Majority has had some influence said Dr Ralph Folcarelli professor of graduate library science at the CW Post Center of Long Island University and chairman of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Suffolk County Library Association Up until recently he said any controversy was primarily about sex And that was easier because if there was demonstrable literary quality you didnt have to worry Its when you get involved with creationism and politics topics like abortion that its a little more difficult Even so public libraries are on more solid ground right now than school libraries Nassau and Suffolk librarians agree with that assessment School librarians really get more than their share of grief said Kay Cassell director of the Huntington Public Library In a public library if a parent wants to control his childrens reading he can come in with them and supervise what they pick out But in schools the kids are there all day without such supervision and people get a lot more uptight about what they think their children are being exposed to Selma Kelsen reference and adult services librarian at the Patchogue Library said I think it was sort of established on Long Island that the philosophy of the Moral Majority would be that while books could be banned in the school library they would not be as strongly opposed in the public library Although the Island Trees case concerned a school library the 1635member coalition of Nassau and Suffolk librarians filed a brief of amicus curiae on the basis that the case concerned library books rather than textbooks and the role of librarians in the selection and maintenance of library materials The brief details the history of the Island Trees controversy in which three members of the School Board using a checklist from an educational conference they had attended went into the high school library and removed copies of nine books that the list described as antiAmerican antiChristian antiSemetic sic and just plain filthy These included wellknown novels such as The Fixer by Bernard Malamud as well as lesserknown works such as A Hero Aint Nothing but a Sandwich by Alice Childress and Go Ask Alice anonymous  Public libraries have traditionally protected their autonomy by having a written selection policy that explains the librarys criteria and rationale for selection of materials These are often appended by the Bill of Rights of the American Library Association A wellthoughtout policy will deter attempts at removing things and will provide a systematic procedure for hearing complaints said Irene Duszkiwicz director of the Hempstead Library But a policy statement should be written in terms of your local situation and not just copies from other libraries When a patron has a complaint about a book he is usually first given a form to complete The form states that theyve read the whole book leaves room to discuss what parts are distasteful to them and what other book would be better said Lynne Ashe director of the Southampton Library In other words there has to be a rationale behind it If they dont like my decision they can appeal to the board But our selection policy makes it fairly clear that we have the right to have a broad diversified collection Some librarians admit that the forms themselves may act as a deterrent by being complicated to fill out You really have to be motivated to complete it Mrs Kelsen said Occasionally weve given out the forms but we rarely get them back The books that local libraries currently get complaints about range from The Hotel New Hampshire in Mattituck to Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman in Old Bethpage A childrens book cited more than once was Sylvester and the Magic Pebble in which policemen are represented as pigs The irony is when they challenge a book like Studs Terkels Working like they did in Pennsylvania Mrs Cassell said The few times Ive had someone complain about a book its never been one I would have picked Certainly Catcher in the Rye has had more than its share Ms Magazine has had a lot of problems and of course books like Slaughterhouse Five come up again and again According to Dr Folcarelli the childrens books that will present problems are usually predictable The Judy Blume books still do he said And a lot of the books that were OK in the 60s are now under attack The 60s were an age of realism in childrens literature when everything went  incest teenage pregnancy drugs  there wasnt a topic that wasnt covered But now the publishers are drawing back as well They tend to cater to the national market and if it isnt going to sell in North Carolina they wont publish it And Little Red Riding Hood There was a man who owned some wolves who used to bring them around to show that they werent really the way they had been stereotyped said Carol Clark cohead of the reference department at the PlainviewOld Bethpage Library He gave a demonstration here then some time later when the childrens room was having a program on Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf he came in and complained Thats exactly what Im talking about But we just laughed Its not the sort of censorship thats any problem Ironically at the library in the Island Trees School District in Levittown there have been few complaints and no pressure to remove books from the shelves or not to give them to children At the time we had people who came in wanting to read the books that were banned said Dennis King the librarys director Other libraries donated copies in case we needed more But that soon died down and in fact the School Board always followed its justification of removing the books from the high school by saying Theyre available in the public library theyre available in the bookstore  A more subtle danger is what Dr Folcarelli characterizes as selfcensorship the idea that some librarians are afraid to make waves by ordering books that would upset the community or affect the library budget vote My concern right now is teaching students the difference between selection and censorship when they decide not to order a book Dr Folcarelli said Another practice that was used to avoid controversy was keeping sensitive materials in the directors office or on the shelves behind the circulation desk These traditionally included books on firearms hypnosis and pharmaceutical drugs as well as controversial novels and nonfiction works on sex Most libraries have done that at some time or another in history but at the moment we have nothing that isnt out on the shelves Mrs Cassell said We try to order wisely then put it all out I feel its a disservice to the public to try and hide part of your collection Most Long Island libraries say they have discontinued the practice Those that do keep certain books in limited circulation maintain that it is to prevent theft rather than promote censorship We try to control books that disappear all the time like the autorepair manuals Mr King said Books like The Joy of Sex would walk off the shelves and disappear Long Island librarians are cautiously optimistic that such books wont be disappearing from the shelves for any other reason

written on the socalled righttolife movement a study of the grassroots moral crusade of the New Right political lobby that mobilized Catholic doctrinal beliefs and fundamentalist religious sentiment in order to get the Human Rights Amendment on the Congressional agenda of the ways they manipulate contemporary social conflicts about the family Journalist Andrew Mertons contribution a fastpaced chronicle of the rise of the righttolife movement and its early activists touches on all of these themes But while his slim volume is readable lively and certainly timely Enemies of Choice is also disappointing it holds out the promise of insight that its ironic argumentative style and reportorial format do not deliver Mr Merton portrays righttolife sympathizers as people less concerned with upholding the rights of the unborn than with repressing sexuality and reversing the gains of the womens movement He writes in his prologue Righttolifers are appalled by what they see as the rampant sexuality of todays society and  they view the outlawing of abortion as a means of restoring a more repressive sexual climate  They openly yearn for a return of women to the traditional role of wife and mother  something that is not likely to happen as long as abortion remains easily available Since Mr Mertons book is based upon lengthy interviews with dozens of leaders and activists in the movement it is not unreasonable to expect him to elaborate on his contention with examples quotations and demographics Some of the evidence is there but the presentation is haphazard and capricious Near the end of the book Mr Merton tackles sexual morality and attitudes toward women in a chapter titled Women as Untermenschen Having given himself only 18 pages to cover the subject he spends several of those pages trying to turn a piece of righttolife rhetoric the claim that abortion is a crime comparable to Nazi genocide  on its head arguing that righttolife supporters are the real Nazis because they treat women as subhumans Rhetorical counterassaults cannot replace argument And his closeups of activists such as Jack Willke Bernard Nathanson and Mildred Jefferson remain opaque Far more persuasive are quotations from righttolife literature that reveal a patronizing attitude toward women and a squeamish uneasiness about sexuality The partial evidence leaves no doubt that Mr Merton has a case even if he has not always presented it well MARIA SABINA Her Life and Chants By Alvaro Estrada Translated and with commen taries by Henry Munn 239 pp Santa Barbara Calif RossErikson 895 THIS memoir of a Mazatec Indian shaman looks at first like a book that missed its time Twenty years ago when the bloom was still on the peyote button and Don Juan only a gleam in Carlos Castanedas eye  wasnt that the moment for North Americans to be captivated by Maria Sabina An unlettered oral poet primitive healer and psilocybin visionary she has spent her nearly 90 years in a remote village in the eastern mountains of Mexico Fortunately Maria Sabina is not meant to be captivating the shaman is granted a human voice and the book is simply the story of a woman a working person When she married at 14 she had already been working for 10 years  washing cooking planting corn and beans in the field near the village of Huautla where her grandparents were landless laborers Her husband Serapio was goodhearted and independent preferring to sell goods in the market to working in the fields When revolutionaries gave him a rifle and took him away she remained behind And when her husband returned they had two more children But Serapio caught the sickness of the wind pneumonia and died suddenly Thus my marital life ended relates Maria Sabina I became a widow at twenty In this laconic fashion the old woman who drinks beer from the bottle goes to mass and respects authority in the form of a local Government official describes a daily life whose constants have been poverty hunger illness violence death and above all work She married again and bore six more children all but one as well as her second husband died of disease or were murdered before she reached middle age In a society where life is so physically harsh to be a healer is to have power Maria Sabinas power belongs to the Language given her by the hallucinogenic mushrooms used in the night vigil the healing ceremony The Language is reproduced here in transcriptions of her shamanic chants extended poetic songs as extravagant as her narrative is restrained Coupled with a life story that leaves no room for romanticism these powerful feats of verbal endurance offer a glimpse into an imaginative world in which magic healing and poetry are one The chants represent of course a performance of dance and words conducted in the unwritten Mazatec dialect The Mexican journalist and native Huautlan Alvaro Estrada translated the Mazatec into Spanish Henry Munn an American living in Huautla provided the English translation which is introduced by the poet Jerome Rothenberg as the first in a RossErikson series of New Wilderness Poetics The commentaries are useful and though weighty do not overwhelm this tough old woman who proves very strong indeed

SAVING BABIES BEFORE BIRTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/28/magazine/saving-babies-before-birth.html,When Andrew Percival was born last Dec 9 he was an eightpound bundle of medical history By all appearances Andrew was a normal newborn with the reflexes and level of alertness one expects in a nearly term baby Andrew had been due to arrive on Christmas Day But two months earlier prenatal diagnosis had revealed that Andrew was suffering from a severe and probably lifethreatening condition fetal hydrocephalus in which the fluidfilled regions of the brain called the ventricles expand monstrously and push so hard on the brain itself that nerve cells fail to develop The result of fetal hydrocephalus is usually profound retardation blindness cerebral palsy or death Andrew was saved from this fate by a team of doctors at Prentice Womens Hospital and Maternity Center in Chicago who treated him when they hoped they had time to salvage some healthy brain tissue They operated on Andrew while he was still in the womb Andrew is one of the worlds first travelers to cross the brave new frontier of fetal surgery he and the handful of others who have had similar treatment represent medical advances that seemed unthinkable even 10 years ago For doctors are discovering that not only can the fragile and previously inviolable environment of the womb be tapped and sounded to provide vital information about the progress of a pregnancy but that the fetus itself can tolerate correctivesurgery while inside the uterus Today with the aid of sophisticated prenatal diagnosis obstetricians are able to detect serious conditions in the fetus early enough to treat some of them before irreparable damage is done Surgeons are able to drain excess fluid from fetal cavities and leave behind tiny draining tubes called catheters that stay in place until birth And in an even more remarkable and potentially promising event obstetricians have demonstrated that the uterus itself can be cut and the fetus exposed for surgery during pregnancy Last April after almost 20 years of animal research ex utero surgery was performed for the first time on a human fetus Although the baby born nearly at term ultimately died because of abnormalities associated with his original problem the surgery itself was pronounced a success It proved the feasibility of opening the womb operating on the fetus and returning it to the uterus for the remainder of pregnancy And it raised the possibility of prenatal interventions far more extensive than anyone had dared imagine In monkeys and perhaps someday in humans scientists are now trying to stimulate limb regeneration replace missing bones and transplant healthy cells or even organs into a fetus which is uniquely receptive to such repair One of the most important developments in all of medicine will be in this field says Dr Gary Hodgen a research scientist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md Prenatal surgery has been a little sister to obstetrics and pediatrics but in a decade I predict it will be an entity to itself As people begin to seek help  all those men and women who dont want to sponsor the life of a damaged individual  more doctors will try to provide what help they can to give the fetus a reasonable chance of a good start in life The advent of fetal surgery is at once thrilling and sobering The method is so new that the risks  and the benefits  are still being weighed While the number of medical centers around the country equipped to perform prenatal interventions grows there are now eight treatment centers three of them new to the field since last November  only 19 fetuses have so far been treated with the advanced techniques now available At least nine infants including Andrew have been saved from lives of severe disability Seven other treated fetuses have for various reasons died since their surgery Another three births are expected by spring Case histories of the procedures performed have not yet been published in medical journals so extensive evaluations of them remain to be made The dangers of all these manipulations may be negligible or they may be profound premature labor premature rupture of the membranes infection rupture of the uterus as pregnancy progresses puncture of a fetal blood vessel or organ And the prospect of such intervention risky as it is raises fundamental questions about when life begins and leads inevitably to issues of abortion and the right to life If the fetus can be treated then is it a patient If it is a patient then is it a person When is this status reached How much risk should the fetus and its mother be expected to endure  especially when there is no guarantee of a normal outcome And if the treatment of certain conditions in utero becomes commonplace what are the legal and moral implications if the parent refuses fetal surgery or opts for an abortion Increasingly as medical technology makes the fetus more and more accessible to pediatric surgeons perceptions of the fetus may well change says the Rev Richard McCormick of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University Already I hear the doctors involved in this refer to the fetus as their patient The fetus now begins to make serious claims for a right to nutrition to protection to therapy How can tolerance of abortion be morally reconciled with those claims From the medical perspective the technique is no less controversial It is not known yet which birth defects are most amenable to correction in the womb and which can just as easily wait to be treated until after the child is born It is not known yet which anomalies do irreparable damage to the fetus long before they are detectable and which are essentially plumbing problems that can be corrected affording the baby a normal life In short no one knows yet whether the procedure itself does any good eannette Percival of Bloomingdale Ill was not thinking about those issues last October when she was told the fetus she had been carrying for more than six months had hydrocephalus It was such a grim prognosis recalls Mrs Percival 31 My first thought was to terminate the pregnancy my daughter who is nearly 3 was born with heart problems But no one would do an abortion at 29 weeks When a medical problem appears abortion is considered an option until the 26th week of a 40week pregnancy The Percivals obstetrician then offered them an alternative to the dreadful certainty of a damaged child We began to think about fetal surgery If something could be done in time we thought we should take the opportunity to do it even though we knew there were risks involved It was not easy though to find someone willing  and able  to do the procedure Quite unlike an amniocentesis which constitutes most obstetricians experience with inserting instruments into the uterus fluid from the womb is withdrawn through a hollow needle for prenatal diagnosis the goal of fetal surgery is to puncture the fetus The doctor then tries to ease a catheter into precisely the right place in the fetuss body and leave it there As a target the fetus is tiny  usually no more than a foot in length and a pound in weight  and incredibly elusive Since the fetus is suspended in amniotic fluid it floats away from the touch of the needle which holds the catheter And since the entire operation is done through the mothers abdomen the doctors cannot see or touch the fetus directly They are guided only by ultrasound which bounces highfrequency sound waves into the uterus and returns them to form a moving shadow of the fetus on a small televisionsize screen The fetuss position and the position of the drains and tubes being inserted can only be inferred Despite these problems a pioneering team of doctors in Denver had already tried the technique on a hydrocephalic fetus With the Colorado doctors serving as consultants Dr Richard Depp an obstetrician at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago agreed to help the Percivals Dr Depp had 10 years experience with an established intrauterine procedure  blood transfusions administered directly to fetuses suffering from severe anemia Mrs Percival was now 30 weeks pregnant  10 weeks away from term Two more weeks dragged by while the doctors waited for clearance to use the catheter called a prenatal brain shunt developed and previously used in Denver The Food and Drug Administration currently monitors distribution of the Denver shunt as it does all experimental devices On Nov 6 Mrs Percival entered the delivery room of Northwesterns Prentice Womens Hospital All the necessary parts and players had been assembled Dr Depp Dr Thomas Brown a neurosurgeon Dr Rudy Sabbagha an obstetrician and ultrasonographer and Nancy Reedy a certified nurse midwife Mrs Percival earlier had been given a mild tranquilizer that would serve to sedate the active fetus Dr Sabbagha directed his ultrasound scanning sensor across Mrs Percivals belly until he could see an image of the fetus In the darkened room the doctors watched on the ultrasound screen as Dr Sabbagha scanned up the fetuss spine Then they saw their target an area at the top of the skull about two inches behind the eyes Dr Depp began He pierced Mrs Percivals anesthetized abdomen and then her uterus with a hollow needle about eight inches long The needle contained a plastic tube the prenatal brain shunt through which the fetuss excess brain fluid would be drained The shunt was about five inches long and thinner than a strand of spaghetti within it was a oneway plastic valve to prevent amniotic fluid from traveling back into the fetuss brain Dr Depp maneuvered the needle close to the fetus and then handed the needle to Dr Brown the neurosurgeon With both hands placed on the mothers abdomen Dr Depp held the fetuss head steady as Dr Brown pushed the needle through the fetuss bony skull and into the enlarged ventricle I could feel it when they put the needle in his head Mrs Percival recalls I felt a gush of fluid and then a trickle it was very warm Even though the doctors were wearing masks and surgical gowns I could see their looks of surprise at how much fluid came out And I heard them wondering out loud whether they should let more fluid out or just put the catheter in place After the flow of brain fluid stopped the needle now protruding just slightly from Mrs Percivals abdomen the doctors began the trickiest step of the procedure  guiding the catheter into place Dr Brown finally pushed the catheter out of the needle and into the fetuss ventricles His goal was to leave just over half of the tube inside the fetuss brain and allow the rest of it to extend from its head and drain into the amniotic fluid Then with the catheter in place in the brain the needle was carefully removed from Mrs Percivals belly In all the procedure had taken just over half an hour Two decades of research and a recent explosion of technological advances in the field of obstetrics preceded the recent attempts to perform fetal surgery Since the early 1960s scientists have been studying the effects of fetal surgery on animals the earliest work being done with fetal lambs Sheep have remarkably tolerant uteruses making them ideal for studying fetal physiology But the very quality that makes sheep good research subjects also makes them poor models for human fetal surgery  they almost never go into premature labor For a better idea of how a fragile uterus would react to surgical manipulation scientists had to move to monkeys whose reactions more closely resemble those of humans Monkey fetal surgery has been fruitful as a result of the recent introduction of powerful antilabor drugs that keep the traumatized uterus from contracting At the University of California San Francisco and at the National Institutes of Health extraordinary monkey surgery allows scientists to experiment with radical procedures that someday may be applied to humans At NIH for instance Dr Gary Hodgen and his coworker Dr Maria Michejda create in fetal monkeys disorders such as hydrocephalus spinal abnormalities even limb deformities typical of children exposed in utero to the drug thalidomide And they can open up the uterus  or peer into the womb through a fetoscope  and successfully correct the defects Since 1980 they have treated 48 hydrocephalic monkeys curing more than 80 percent of them Last year they also successfully transplanted bone tissue into 27 monkey fetuses The bone ground into a toothpastelike gel stimulated the growth in the fetus of new healthy bone This experiment paves the way for treating such major anomalies as spina bifida literally open spine by creating a new bony covering for the exposed spinal cord In the future Dr Hodgen envisions transplanting entire organs in utero to take advantage of the fact that the fetus has no immune surveillance system and thus is unlikely to reject a foreign organ Others propose someday transplanting the body cells that manufacture essential chemicals known to be missing in certain inherited disorders such as TaySachs disease with the hope that those few cells will act as a template on which other healthy cells can be built The first human intrauterine procedures were done in New Zealand in 1963 when fetuses dying of severe anemia because of Rh blood incompatibility were given transfusions directly into the abdomen Prenatal transfusions have been widely performed since then and are still common although an injection that prevents the anemia has sharply curtailed the need for this risky undertaking Yet it took more than 10 years for prenatal therapy to be recognized as valuable in any condition other than blood disease The reason for the delay For fetal treatment to come of age it first had to await the maturation of fetal diagnosis Obstetricians today have on hand a wide range of tools for diagnosing congenital disorders months before birth Amniocentesis first used to detect genetic disease in 1967 has been greatly improved Today the procedure  which involves withdrawing a sample of amniotic fluid from the womb for chemical and chromosomal analysis  is almost risk free and can reveal the presence of about 100 biochemical defects Ultrasound has been greatly refined since the mid1970s The new generation of ultrasound equipment allows doctors to see the fetuss organs to count fingers and toes to find genitals and to make inferences about fetal health and function based on size proportions the amount of amniotic fluid even the emptying of the bladder the rise and fall of the chest and blinking of the eyes Other more recent methods of prenatal diagnosis are also becoming more widely used especially fetoscopy in which a periscopelike instrument inserted into the uterus allows the doctor to see the fetus directly and to withdraw bits of the fetuss skin blood or muscles for further study Once doctors could begin diagnosing fetal disorders with assurance they could at last start thinking about correcting them as early as possible  before birth Medical therapy for fetuses came first Since 1974 drugs have been administered to fetuses suffering from vitamin deficiency heartbeat irregularities and thyroid malfunction  either by giving the drug to the mother or infusing it directly into the amniotic fluid which the fetus instinctively swallows But surgical manipulation of the fetus is another matter entirely It has become possible only recently with the introduction of powerful and effective drugs to stop premature labor which is the greatest obstacle to fetal surgery The earliest tries at surgical treatment  other than transfusions  were drainings of excess fluid through a long hollow needle The first such needling occurred in 1978 when physicians at Harvard University tried to drain the brain fluid from a fetus with hydrocephalus Because the fluid reaccumulated rapidly the punctures had to be repeated six times The child is alive today but he has major brain malformations is profoundly retarded and in an unrelated condition has muscular dystrophy More successful needlings have since been attempted among the most dramatic of them at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond There Dr Fay Redwine an obstetrician and geneticist and Dr Robert Petres an ultrasonographer and obstetrician successfully drained fluid that had been accumulating dangerously in two fetuses In each instance a successful needling saved the fetus from damage that could have resulted from the extraordinary pressure that was being applied to developing organs Last August the Richmond doctors found that Deborah Pinion then in her last month of pregnancy was carrying a fetus with two collapsed lungs and a huge accumulation of fluid in the chest To see whether this fluid had permanently impaired lung development Dr Redwine inserted a needle into the fetuss chest on the right side to avoid the chance of piercing the heart on the left and withdrew the excess fluid Dramatically the fetuss lung expanded proof that one lung at least had the potential to work once the baby was born But two days later ultrasound showed that the lung had collapsed again and the fluid buildup continued Because Mrs Pinion was already so far along in her pregnancy she was sent home to wait until she went into labor When she did on Sept 3 she returned to the medical college and the physicians again withdrew a large amount of fluid from the fetuss chest  this time just as the baby was about to descend into the birth canal Within three hours little Emily Pinion was born screaming She was as pink and pretty as she could be says her mother Six hours after Emilys birth the doctors inserted a tube into her left lung to help inflate it One week later the tube was removed and Emily went home with two functioning lungs Except for a metabolic problem which caused the original fluid buildup in her chest and is being treated with a special infant formula Emily is a healthy 6monthold Intrauterine catheterization is far trickier than needling since it requires implanting a tube that will be left in the fetus It is more invasive and more risky but it allows doctors to think about treating more complicated and potentially more damaging conditions At the same time it raises thorny questions about which fetuses to treat and how much risk is acceptable One of the major centers for this work along with Denver is the medical school at the University of California San Francisco where a fetal treatment program was formally established in 1980 This is the center where the nations first exterior surgery was performed last year on a human fetus Since then the physicians have made more than half a dozen attempts to correct fetal defects through less invasive means The San Francisco team consists of Dr Mitchell Golbus an obstetrician with long experience as head of the universitys Prenatal Detection Program one of the most sophisticated in the country Dr Michael Harrison a pediatric surgeon who routinely operates on infants in the first days of life to correct the very conditions he now hopes to treat before birth Dr Roy Filly an ultrasound diagnostician who has been able to find abnormal growths the size of dimes on fetuss spines kidneys and elsewhere Dr Mark Rosen an anesthesiologist familiar with the special anesthetic needs of women who must be operated on during pregnancy and Rita Douglas a genetic counselor who has been working with Dr Golbus in the prenatal detection center The average age of the group is under 40 The team is known for fetal treatment of a severe lifethreatening urinarytract obstruction called hydronephrosis In this condition a blockage in the urethra which passes urine from the bladder causes a backup into the fetuss abdomen As the urine accumulates two things can happen The kidneys can balloon and suffer permanent damage or the amniotic fluid composed primarily of fetal urine can all but disappear Either of these can be fatal to the fetus If the fetus does live he and at least 90 percent of those affected by this condition are males is likely to suffer severe kidney damage or as a result of the insufficient amniotic fluid have severe anomalies of the face limbs and lungs The first baby born at San Francisco after treatment for urinarytract obstruction was Michael Skinner who is now almost 10 months old Michael was a twin which greatly complicated the doctors decision to proceed To minimize the risk of inadvertently damaging Michaels healthy twin sister they chose to wait to treat Michaels bladder obstruction until both fetuses lungs were likely to be mature enough to survive a premature birth Although Michaels condition was diagnosed at 17 weeks gestation he was not treated until 30 weeks The procedure was first attempted on April 13 but the doctors had trouble placing a straight plastic catheter in the fetuss bladder When she learned they had failed the mother Rosa Skinner asked simply When can we try again Within days ultrasound scans showed the fetuss blockage was worsening so Drs Harrison and Golbus designed a catheter they hoped would be easier to insert  one with a memory to curl at one end once it was pushed off the needle This curl insured that the catheter would stay in the bladder and not pull out into the amniotic sac On April 26 the California team was ready to try again And this time the procedure worked The twins were born by vaginal delivery on May 10 six weeks prematurely Two of Mrs Skinners three other children were also premature The day after Michael was born the catheter which ran from his bladder to just inside his abdominal wall was removed and a temporary drainage system for his urine was made surgically Last fall Michaels urinary tract was rerouted in a second operation and he still faces one last surgery reconstruction of his abdominal muscles to correct the flaccid skin folds called prune belly that resulted from his weeks of abdominal distension while he was in utero Some experts in fetal surgery are critical of inserting catheters for urinarytract obstructions They wonder whether the procedure really does any good In the case of Michael Skinner if the fetus could survive to 32 weeks without a catheter he could have survived to 34 weeks says one obstetrician with fetalsurgery experience who asked not to be named I havent heard of one case of treating urinarytract obstructions in which the babys life was really saved I dont think that having a catheter in there for two weeks was lifesaving Dr Richard Berkowitz of Yale University raises similar questions Dr Berkowitz is one of the few physicians outside of San Francisco who has treated a fetus for urinarytract obstruction In this case the catheter had been in place and working for nearly eight weeks but the baby died soon after birth Sept 30 because of kidney abnormalities that had occurred early in gestation Some bladder obstructions are intermittent Dr Berkowitz says They dont totally block the passage of urine into the amniotic fluid In these less severe obstructions there is the potential for the kidney to develop normally But then is it really necessary to put the shunt in We just dont know yet which cases are too late to save which dont need treatment in utero and which are optimal candidates for fetal surgery Because doctors do not know parents cannot know whether the procedure will help their child But the great majority of parents when offered fetal surgery are more than willing to take the risk The parents do not evaluate in any clear rational way the fact that the baby could still be very sick when its born says Rita Douglas the genetic counselor Im not sure how able people are in the moment of crisis to really comprehend what it will mean to face hospital visit after hospital visit to face two or three surgical procedures to have a child who is chronically sick When a mother is told her baby is sick and theres something that might be done to help him thats all she focuses on Another issue rarely raised in these deliberations is the matter of cost Today the procedure itself is considered experimental which can be a mixed blessing It means fetal surgeons usually do not charge for their services but it also means insurance companies may balk at covering their fees when they do charge And the corollary costs of fetal surgery can be staggering In Andrew Percivals case for instance his mother says that all the added expenses of his care several prenatal ultrasound scans two weeks in the intensivecare nursery and surgery to replace the temporary intrauterine drain have already come to 22000 In deliberations with the parents Dr Golbus is likely to play devils advocate trying to make the parents see that they need not go ahead with the procedure Theyve had some refusals from parents says Dr Albert Jonsen a member of the universitys humansubject protection committee with which Dr Golbus regularly consults Some parents have decided to wait it out or to terminate the pregnancy That I think is a good indication that people are understanding what they are being asked to participate in If there hadnt been refusals then Id be suspicious about whether the parents really were giving truly informed consent Dr Golbus himself shows ambivalence about the procedure My biggest worry he says is that we might take a lesion that is lethal and correct it just enough that it is not lethal but is still incapacitating The odds are high that we will end up either losing or winning  either the child will die or his problem will be corrected  but we cant say we will never end up in between The prospect of a halfway solution  or a solution that in fact creates more problems than it solves  is even more ominous in the treatment of fetal hydrocephalus Once hydrocephalus shows up on ultrasound is the damage already too extensive to allow normal development What if through a fetal surgeons efforts a hydrocephalic fetus lives but is still profoundly retarded Such questions are raised over and over again as medical centers across the country attempt prenatal brain shunts The first such operations were performed at the University of Colorado where the prenatal brain shunt most widely used was developed and it remains the center with the most clinical experience While the doctors there are reluctant to discuss their work in this area pending further evaluation of the procedure it is known that the first baby treated in Denver was born on July 16 when he was three months old the last time he was tested he was slightly delayed in his motor development The second child treated born on Nov 23 was sent home from the hospital with normal neurological test results And the third whose shunt was implanted in December is due to be born in April Around the time of Andrew Percivals operation in Chicago four other procedures were also done on hydrocephalic fetuses The results varied widely and each case raises different medical and ethical concerns Two treated babies were born in recent weeks  at Yale University on Jan 15 and at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia on Feb 15  and they are both too young for a meaningful prognosis But the two other attempts already have proved unsuccessful At BowmanGray School of Medicine in WinstonSalem NC doctors last November diagnosed severe hydrocephalus in a 15weekold fetus When marked hydrocephalus is seen that early says Dr Lewis Nelson an obstetrician and ultrasonographer at the medical school the chances of its being anywhere near normal at term are practically zero But the mother was personally opposed to abortion and the fetuss hydrocephalus worsened rapidly DrNelson told the mother about the possibility of treatment We left the decision to her and her husband he says I think they understood that even if we did the procedure they could have a child who was perfectly shunted but was still abnormal On Jan 11 when the mother was 24 weeks pregnant  the time when the fetal head was finally a sufficiently large target  Dr Nelson and four colleagues attempted a prenatal brain shunt We werent especially anxious to do the procedure ourselves Dr Nelson admits but the mother had no money and I couldnt afford to fly her out to Colorado As it is we did it for free They added to the procedure the use of a fetoscope as well as an ultrasound scan to be sure they saw the catheter in place Although the shunt went in properly and seemed to be working there were problems Twelve hours later the fetus died in utero According to Dr Nelson he probably suffered a bleed into the ventricles or at the point of the catheters entry into the head This of course is the nightmare of fetal surgeons that their efforts will lead to the death of a fetus But I wonder Dr Nelson says is he any worse off now than he would have been if we hadnt treated him at all The fourth fetus treated around this time has since died too but as a result not of the surgery but of the underlying brain malformation that caused the hydrocephalus On Oct 23 Dr Fredric Frigoletto an obstetrician at Harvard University Medical School and Dr Jason Birnholz a Harvard ultrasonographer tried to insert a Denver shunt into the head of a 25weekold fetus After two tries they gave up But the parents Frank and Jackie Hynes of Windham NH wanted to try again That first procedure was a terrible time for me sitting at the head of the operating table holding Jackies hand recalls Mr Hynes I just felt that everything had gone wrong for us I didnt want to look at anyone I felt drained But I wanted them to keep trying I just wanted to feel that everything that was medically possible to save our baby had been done The following week when it was clear the fetuss head was growing still larger the Hyneses urged the Harvard doctors to try one more time Dr Frigoletto and Dr Birnholz wanted to try a simple straight fourinch catheter without the valve used in the Denver shunt and the parents gave their fervent consent On Nov 5 the team tried again and the catheter was in place  and draining fluid on the first try Everyone was really pleased Mrs Hynes says The next morning when I went in for an ultrasound the babys head looked as though you had taken a balloon filled it with air and then deflated it But the ultrasound also showed another problem The fetus had a cleft lip which could indicate still other anomalies that could not be seen on ultrasound As it turned out that was the case Mark Hynes was born on Nov 16 with a facial cleft running from his lip to right eye And the cleft in turn may have been the sign of a major midline brain malformation The doctors believe that Marks brain stem was probably malformed which caused all his vital functions  respiration metabolism heart rate  to go awry When he was 5 weeks old Mark began going into convulsions and he died of cardiac arrest Were sad that Marks gone his father says But I cant feel guilty about anything we did or didnt do Mark suffered a lot both before his birth and afterward But I felt that if I had asked him Do you want to go through with this if he had been able to answer he always would have said yes Marks story points to a problem in treating fetal hydrocephalus It often is a sign of other more profound anomalies One of the most common problems associated with fetal hydrocephalus is spina bifida a malformation of the spinal cord that results in an exposed bundle of nerve fibers at the base of the spine and probable paralysis below the lesion Fetal surgeons currently make every effort to try to eliminate fetuses with associated defects from the pool of those eligible for a prenatal brain shunt We wont do anything unless we know the hydrocephalus is an isolated defect says Dr William Clewell head of the University of Colorado team This is a highly experimental procedure and its our right to say we dont want to confuse the results with other abnormalities Moral and medical uncertainties of fetal surgery are brought into sharpest focus as doctors cross the final barrier in prenatal treatment the uterus itself And last April the San Francisco team managed to cut into the womb and partially remove the fetus for surgery Theres no question that ours was a successful operation says Dr Harrison with evident pride in his landmark ex utero surgery It worked perfectly and it establishes the feasibility of doing it again He and Dr Golbus refused to elaborate on their operation pending publication of their case study in The New England Journal of Medicine But they will confirm what has already appeared in the lay press According to reports the doctors cut into the uterus of a woman midway through pregnancy partially removed her 21weekold fetus from the womb and operated on it while it was still attached to the umbilical cord to bypass a urinarytract blockage Both mother and fetus were anesthetized with general anesthesia The fetuss blockage was similar to the obstruction that the San Francisco team has since treated with catheterization but it was different enough in ways Drs Harrison and Golbus will not reveal to warrant this dramatic technique After the operation in which a hole was made to vent fetal urine into the amniotic fluid above the obstruction the surgeons returned the fetus to the womb replaced the amniotic fluid with a saline solution the fetus had not been producing any on its own sewed up the uterus and the mothers abdomen and allowed the pregnancy to continue to term Premature labor the greatest risk of this surgery was prevented by the administration of powerful antilabor drugs both before and after the operation During the procedure when the antilabor drugs could not be used because they can cause a toxic reaction when mixed with general anesthesia the anesthesia alone was sufficient to relax the uterus and keep it from going into labor Because the pregnancy continued to term the physicians say they proved the feasibility of performing surgery outside the womb But sadly this operation was too late to save the child Twelve hours after he was born the baby died As a direct result of the early lack of amniotic fluid which in turn was a direct result of the urinarytract obstruction his lungs had failed to grow Even though his condition had been diagnosed early in his mothers pregnancy enough damage had already been done that the most extraordinary medical heroics were still in vain Nonetheless Dr Harrison is encouraged by the experience especially since it allows him to think about correction of what to him is the most tragic and frustrating of birth defects diaphragmatic hernia In this condition a hole in the diaphragm which separates the abdomen from the chest allows the intestines to migrate into the chest cavity This crushes the lungs and inhibits their development turning a minor anatomic flaw into a fatal disorder The problem is absolutely easy to fix in the newborn Dr Harrison says But still no matter how perfectly you do the surgery about half the babies die The limiting factor is not the hole in the diaphragm or the guts in the chest or the surgery on so small a baby The limiting factor is that the lungs have been squished in utero and havent been allowed to develop The rapid growth of hospitals equipped to perform fetal surgery means the experts will have to move fast in deciding whether the technique fulfills its promise While fetal surgery may turn out to be the ultimate in preventive medicine saving hundreds of babies a year from a lifetime of disability it may also turn out to be risky and unwarranted Experience with intrauterine surgery is too limited to date to draw conclusions about its value  but there is no way to prevent parents from wanting it or doctors from performing it Any trained obstetrician with an ultrasound machine and a long hollow needle is entitled to try to treat a fetus Every one of us has done thousands of amniocenteses says Dr Thomas Kerenyi an obstetrician at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who is prepared to try to treat fetal hydrocephalus as soon as he finds an appropriate case This gives us the courage to go a little further  because we have the knowledge in our fingers The potential of fetal surgery poses some basic questions about life and death Dr John Fletcher a bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health applauds the dawn of fetal surgery but sees on the horizon an ethical quagmire In a recent editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association he called attention to the apparent inconsistency of encouraging fetal therapy on the one hand and respecting parental choice about abortion on the other Should the moral status of the wanted fetus with a treatable defect outweigh that of an unwanted fetus with the same treatable defect Dr Fletcher envisions grave moral dilemmas when for instance the treatment is more risky to the mother than to the fetus Improvements in fetal therapy will establish a stronger ground to protect the affected fetuss right to life which will collide with the wellestablished ground for the parental right to a choice about abortion Fetal surgery at this moment resides in an ethical gray zone not quite research and not quite therapy Doctors are now grappling with the question of just which fetus to treat and when They do not know yet whether they are salvaging fetuses that will become profoundly retarded or otherwise handicapped children whether they are operating on fetuses that would have survived intact without their help or whether they are doing what they hope they are doing  producing healthy normal children who otherwise might have died Currently the conventional medical response to most detectable severe fetal anomalies is still considered to be abortion If that changes in the next five or 10 years and if fetal surgery becomes the treatment of choice the path is cleared for the possibility of lawsuits from children who do not receive such therapy Can a child born with hydrocephalus sue his obstetrician for failing to detect and treat the condition in utero Can he sue his parents for failing to agree to the procedure but allowing him to be born anyway Questions like these will be posed at a meeting in Houston on March 11 cosponsored by the medical school of the University of Texas on the legal implications of granting rights of personhood to the fetus they will likely be raised again at conferences scheduled for this spring and summer convening the nations leading practitioners of fetal surgery Until fetal surgery proves its usefulness such questions must take a back seat to the essential question at hand Is the treatment likely to do any good I never wonder about that says Dr Harrison who as a pediatric surgeon went into the field of fetal surgery out of the frustration of trying to treat newborns who were already too damaged to survive Once you see a kid with a diaphragmatic hernia die in his mothers arms on his first day of life you never have any questions about whether to treat these problems as early as you can
THE WRONG LABEL FOR THE ABORTION ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/01/opinion/l-the-wrong-label-for-the-abortion-issue-255582.html,To the Editor In his Jan 25 OpEd article Avoidable Births Alfred Moran takes the Catholic Church to task for its stand against abortion His article begins I was reared a Roman Catholic and I am intimately familiar with the religious doctrine that preaches protection for the fetus regardless of consequences for woman or child here are countless people in our country who uphold protection of the human fetus and do not base their position on religious doctrine Many profess no religion at all Their native sense of right and wrong tells them that if the fetus possesses human life it is evil to kill it and they are persuaded not because of religious teaching but simply on the grounds of their own deep conviction that the life growing in a human mothers womb is a human life Recently I spoke with a Congressman who told me When people ask me whether my prolife position is a religious one I tell them that I dont see the question as religious at all It is my training as a lawyer which tells me that a fetus is a human being from the beginning and it is simply wrong to take its life It is unfair and misleading to cast the abortion issue as a Catholic one If the product of a womans conception is a human being five minutes after birth why is it not human five minutes before How does that become a Catholic question And if it is human five minutes before birth why is it not human five weeks five months and nine months before birth How does it end up human if it does not start out human What happens at what point of its development to change it from something to someone Why would birth constitute as human the same being that moments before was merely a living thing with no more value than say a flower The question is serious and it torments the consciences of millions of intelligent people They are not religious fanatics They are well educated cultured thoughtful persons like the Congressman Among them are doctors lawyers university professors scientists  people who walk a thousand different paths and bring to this question a vast variety of knowledge and experience Mr Moran attempts to sidestep that question as does Planned Parenthood which once opposed abortion as the destruction of human life but the question cannot be sidestepped because human life is sacred If it is present it must be respected No one may destroy it We cannot speak of freedom here Not if human life is present If it is not present then perhaps those who choose to kill the being in the womb may be allowed to do so But surely not if it is a human being The collective conscience of the human race does not allow freedom when it comes to killing a human being The burden of proof lies obviously on those who contend that the unborn child is not inherently human Nowhere have I seen this proof Whoever has it should produce it proof that on the last day before birth the notyetborn child is not a human being The proof must be such as to remove all doubt If even the least doubt remains abortion is not permissible As President Reagan said in a recent news conference if we come upon a body lying in the street we dont bury it until we are sure it is dead Mr Moran spoke of compulsory childbearing which obviously no one advocates To bear or not to bear a child is a Godgiven choice of every woman But the choice has to be made before conception before the child exists There is a vast and unbridgeable difference between avoiding conception and killing the one conceived I appeal to readers not to think of the abortion issue as a Catholic one It simply isnt The church does not seek to impose its view on others Rather its members join the multitude of others  fellow Christians Jews Islamics people of various faiths and those of no particular faith including a large number of professed atheists  in their view which simply stated is If anyones life is not sacred then no ones life is sacred born or unborn young or old handicapped or healthy For all are created equal Bishop PATRICK V AHERN Staten Island NY Feb 8 1982 The writer Vicar of Staten Island heads the New York State Bishops ProLife Committee
"REAGAN'S CONCEPT OF AMERICA HURTS PARTY, PACKWOOD SAYS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/02/us/reagan-s-concept-of-america-hurts-party-packwood-says.html,Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon says he is sometimes dismayed in meetings with President Reagan because the President responds to the concerns of Republican leaders on a totally different track For example Mr Packwood said Pete Domenici of New Mexico the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee might note at a meeting that weve got a 120 billion deficit coming and the President says You know a person yesterday a young man went into a grocery store and he had an orange in one hand and a bottle of vodka in the other and he paid for the orange with food stamps and he took the change and paid for the vodka Thats whats wrong And we just shake our heads the Oregonian said Mr Packwood who heads the Senate Republican Campaign Committee attributed the problem to what he termed Mr Reagans idealized concept of America which is basically white male and Protestant And that view he said is destroying the partys appeal among blacks Hispanics and Jews More Impact Than Economy That will hurt us more in the long run than the economy Mr Packwood said in an interview over the weekend I really think the President has an idealized concept of America he said And maybe many Americans wish we were like that Maybe many Americans wish we all looked alike went to the same middleoftheroad Protestant church and wed all be better off I dont think we would be better off He said he feared that Mr Reagans positions on abortion the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and tax exemptions for schools that discriminate racially would cause lasting damage to his party The Republican Party has just about written off those women who work for wages he said We are losing them in droves You cannot write them off and the blacks off and the Hispanics off and the Jews off and assume youre going to build a party on white AngloSaxon males over 40 There arent enough of us left Insight Gained at Meetings When asked if he thought Mr Reagan was aware that that might be happening Mr Packwood said the party leadership meetings at the White House were where Ive gotten the best insight Nonetheless Mr Packwood said he thought Mr Reagan still has an amazing popular appeal and could win reelection overwhelmingly But that is different from building a majority Republican Party he said What I want is when people go down the list and finally come to the office theyve never heard of and candidates theyve never heard of that they vote Republican because because they have an intuitive feeling that the Republican Party is watching out for their interests I dont see that building now in the Republican Party I think we were closer to it in November 1980 than we are now
Helms Introduces Bill to Bar Federal Money for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/us/helms-introduces-bill-to-bar-federal-money-for-abortions.html,Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina has introduced another antiabortion bill apparently signaling a breakdown in his attempts to resolve an impasse with Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican over attempts to unify foes of abortion Senator Helms introduced the new bill his second this session on the Senate floor late Monday Like his previous bill it defines human life as starting at conception and gives fetuses limited constitutional rights The new bill would also prohibit the use of Federal funds or money from Federal insurance plans for an abortion except when a womans life was endangered by the pregnancy Mr Helmss earlier bill proposed strict limits on the power of lower Federal courts in abortion cases but his new measure removes some of those proposed limitations
ANTIBUSING MOVES PASSED BY SENATE AFTER LONG FIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/us/antibusing-moves-passed-by-senate-after-long-fight.html,The Senate voted today to adopt legislation that would virtually eliminate school busing for racial integration ending an eightmonth argument spiced by a filibuster The bill now goes to the House where opponents have vowed to use parliamen Senate rollcall page A18 tary maneuvers to kill it before it ever comes to a vote The Senate vote of 57 to 37 marked the biggest victory to date for conservatives who are pushing bills that could strip Federal courts of their jurisdiction over such emotional social issues as busing abortion and school Prediction by Californian This is an entirely inappropriate way to legislate and were not going to allow it to happen Representative Don Edwards the California Democrat who heads the Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee said It would be the beginning of a breakdown of the Federal court system Representative Peter W Rodino Jr chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said that the bill raises disturbing questions of policy and constitutionality adding It is without precedent in its severe restrictions on the Federal courts The New Jersey Democrat said he would ask the Justice Department for an opinion on the bills constiutionality In the Senate debate Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut vowed that even if the bill passed the House he would stage another filibuster if it returned to the Senate Rapping his desk for emphasis the Connecticut lawmaker said to the Senate This legislation will not be enacted into law in this session of Congress Two Riders on Original Bill The bill that originally came to the Senate floor last June authorized funds for the Department of Justice Despite a tenacious filibuster led by Mr Weicker the Senate adopted two riders One proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina would bar the Justice Department from using the money to litigate school busing cases The second proposed by Senator J Bennett Johnston a Louisiana Democrat would forbid Federal courts to issue orders to transport children more than five miles or 15 minutes away from home The House passed a bill last year containing language similar to the Helms amendment but never considered the Johnston rider Under normal circumstances the two bills would now go to a HouseSenate conference to iron out their differences but supporters of the bill realized that such a conference would probably result in a stalemate Accordingly the supporters are sending the Senate bill directly to the House and asking for consideration by the Judiciary Committee However opponents of the bill are likely to demand that the bill be held at the Speakers desk and not referred to committee a maneuver that would keep the legislation effectively buried Supporters of the bill conceded today that their only hope for House action was to generate public pressure on the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr to bring the issue to a vote Senator Johnston asserted that it would be an outrageous arrogation of power by the Speaker to bury the bill Senator Helms warned that Mr ONeill and the Democrats will have to answer at the polls in November for their actions But the bills supporters did not seem hopeful about their ultimate chances I understand Senator Johnston said that theres a big hill to climb in the House Bills Foes May Win the War There is growing evidence in the Senate that while foes of the antibusing bill lost the battle today they are winning the war to ward off an agenda of social issues this year Weve sent a clear signal to the leadership insisted Senator Weicker There are many important matters coming through the pipeline and they cant afford any more social issues in terms of time Senator Johnston agreed that it would be exceedingly difficult for the Senate to consider additional social legislation this year However Senator Howard H Baker Jr the Republican leader has promised conservatives a full hearing on social issues this session and Senator Helms indicated today that he would keep the pressure on the Senate leadership He said that he would move shortly to bring the school prayer issue to the floor but he acknowledged that foes of legalized abortion remain divided over strategy The prayer issue centers on efforts by conservatives to circumvent or overturn by statute a Supreme Court ruling forbidding organized praying in public schools Supporters of the legislation passed today said that busing orders have been imposed around the country by the tyranny of unelected courts discovering a new Constitutional right as Senator Johnston put it The verdict is in said the Louisiana Democrat whose home state has been the scene of some controversial court orders And that verdict very loudly and clearly says that busing doesnt work In the eightmonth debate the Senator added not one foe of the legislation ever defended the practice of busing Does it integrate schools asked Mr Johnston Does it improve education Where is the evidence Where is the debate on that issue Return of Public Support Sought Accordingly Mr Johnston asserted ending the practice would encourage the return of public support for education and would allow us to move on to what is really important the education of our children Mr Weicker admitted that busing touched some very raw nerves among voters and that the bill passed today will be a great vehicle for campaigning But the real issue opponents insisted was not the efficacy of busing but the integrity of the Federal courts In an unusually harsh statement Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas said the bill was part of a continuing sinister devious attack on the Constitution and added We will today begin the erosion of the only document that stands between the people and tyranny The Senator noted that many bills had been introduced to limit court jurisdictions over controversial issues The purpose he said was to alter the Constitution through a simple statute and avoid the arduous process of actually amending it If Congress succeeds in this abrogation of the amendatory process Mr Bumpers warned it will happen again and again and again The American Civil Liberties Union called the bill a frontal assault on the independence of the Federal judiciary and said it was unconstitutional While agreeing with that assessment Mr Bumpers said that if the bill ever became law and somehow survived a constitutional challenge you can take the Constitution and use it as a dartboard From the New YorkNew JerseyConnecticut area only Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York supported the bill The Democratic Senators Daniel P Moynihan of New York Bill Bradley of New Jersey Harrison A Williams Jr of New Jersey and Christopher J Dodd of Connecticut joined Mr Weicker in opposing the measure
PACKWOOD APOLOGIZES TO REAGAN FOR SAYING HE IS HARMING G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/us/packwood-apologizes-to-reagan-for-saying-he-is-harming-gop.html,Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon apologized to President Reagan and fellow Republican senators today for having said that the Presidents concept of America had hurt the party and that Mr Reagan was sometimes unresponsive to the concerns of Republican Congressional leaders The Senator chairman of the Commerce Committee and the Senate Republican Campaign Committee apologized for having spoken out of turn but not for the substance of his remarks made in an interview Monday with The Associated Press The apology was conveyed in a telephone call to the President aboard Air Force One and at a closed luncheon meeting of the 53member Republican conference according to several senators who were present Larry Speakes the deputy White House press secretary said Mr Packwood had told Mr Reagan Im sorry I made a mistake Mr Speakes said the President replied Im pretty upset about it but I accept your apology Senator Packwood declined to talk to reporters today but Etta Fielek his press secretary emphasized He hasnt retracted anything Quote Termed Accurate The Senator stressed at the luncheon meeting that he had been accurately quoted and quipped that those were the quotes that could do the most damage The apology came in the wake of a storm of criticism from his fellow Republicans including some suggestions that he resign his chairmanship of the campaign committee Some colleagues speculated that Mr Packwoods remarks indicated lingering bitterness over his defeat in his campaign to have the Senate reject the sale of Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee met with Mr Packwood for 20 minutes this morning and urged him to apologize Some colleagues called the Senators statements out of line and irresponsible but others praised his candor and courage Much of the criticism came from conservative senators some of whom regard Mr Packwood as out of step with the party because of his moderate views But others nodded their heads in silent agreement and privately praised the Senator for saying the same things in public that they had said in private Criticism From Hatch Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee said I told Bob that that was out of line and irresponsible even if it was true Jake Garn another Utah Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said the problem was not with the President but with those who lacked the courage to stand up for what the President was trying to accomplish On the other hand Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut a Republican maverick who had kept his conservative colleagues tied in knots by filibustering antibusing proposals hailed Mr Packwoods comments I admire the candor courage and political common sense displayed by the Senator from Oregon he said Frustration Among Republicans In many ways Senator Packwood expressed the frustration increasingly voiced by Republican Congressional leaders who have thus far been unable to persuade the President to accept Congressional proposals intended to reduce the Federal deficit by raising taxes and scaling back Mr Reagans proposed increase in military spending Many of those leaders have said privately they do not believe Mr Reagan fully appreciates the burden of their message Mr Packwood said in the interview that Mr Reagan had an idealized concept of America that was basically white male and Protestant And that view he said was destroying the partys appeal among blacks Hispanic Americans and Jews Mr Packwood said he feared that Mr Reagans positions on abortion the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and tax exemptions for schools that practice racial discrimination would cause lasting damage to his party

"Ayn Rand, ‘Fountainhead’ Author, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/obituaries/ayn-rand-fountainhead-author-dies.html,Ayn Rand the writer and philosopher of objectivism who espoused rational selfishness and capitalism unbound died yesterday morning at her home on East 34th Street She was 77 years old and a longtime resident of New York Miss Rand was perhaps best known for her novels The Fountainhead of 1943 for which she wrote the screenplay when it was turned into a movie with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal and Atlas Shrugged published in 1957 From the 1960s on she increasingly devoted herself to expounding her views more directly in such books as The Virtue of Selfishness 1965 and Capitalism The Unknown Ideal 1966 She also served as editor of The Objectivist a monthly journal from 1962 to 1971 and wrote The Ayn Rand Letter from 1971 to 1976 Her philosophy of objectivism holds that only individual ability and effort account for real achievement and that laissezfaire capitalism provides the optimal environment for talent Her view of selfishness as a virtue and altruism as a vice was a reversal of the traditional JudeoChristian ethic Man as a Heroic Being Her detractors decried objectivism as the deification of selfishness But Miss Rand its founder asserted that she had never advocated the pursuit of mindless selfinterest at all cost The concept of rational selfishness ran counter to altruism Miss Rand despised altruism as personal weakness and believed it responsible for much of the worlds dishonesty and misery My philosophy in essence Miss Rand once wrote is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute It was during the 1970s that Miss Rand giving lectures across the country attracted the attention of a new generation of students who believed in unfettered freedom and made her something of a cult figure in libertarian circles Miss Rand spurned the libertarians as a random collection of emotional hippiesoftheright who seek to play at politics without philosophy as she put it in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1976 She proclaimed herself a supporter of President Gerald R Ford because she wrote he was the most honest defender of free enterprise Opposed Reagan Ideas At the same time Miss Rand declared that she was profoundly opposed to Ronald Reagan and his Presidential ambitions Since he denies the right to abortion he cannot be a defender of any rights she wrote Since he has no program and no ideology to offer his likeliest motive for entering the Presidential race is power lust It remained unclear whether she changed her mind about Mr Reagan once he became President Miss Rand whose first name rhymed with pine shied away from reporters in recent years fearful that they were hostile to her philosophy and would distort her views Miss Rands views were much in demand in 1974 when President Richard M Nixon named Alan Greenspan the economics consultant to become chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers It turned out that Miss Rand had been the mentor and a 20year close friend to Mr Greenspan Miss Rand helped persuade the somewhat reluctant Mr Greenspan to join the Government so he could put their confidence in the capitalist spirit into action I helped Alan to analyze what was involved she told an interviewer that year But of course the decision was his own Born in Russia Ayn Rand was born Feb 2 1905 in St Petersburg now Leningrad and graduated from the University of Leningrad in 1924 two years before she came to the United States and headed for Hollywood to work as a movie extra and junior screenwriter At that time she met Charles Francis OConnor an artist on a movie set and married him in 1929 Mr OConnor died in 1979 in New York Miss Rand came to New York in 1929 to work for RKO Pictures starting as a filing clerk and becoming office head in the wardrobe department Through the 1930s she began her career as a screenwriter for Universal Pictures Paramount Pictures and MetroGoldwynMayer She also worked without pay in 1937 as a typist for Eli Jacques Kahn the architect in New York in order to do the research for her novel The Fountainhead The story was that of an architect later portrayed by Gary Cooper who blew up his construction project when he found that its design had been adulterated by others It also served as a vehicle for her presentation of her hero as the stubborn and lonely individualist As her novel took shape she continued as a screenwriter working six months each year under contract to the movie companies She took the next six months off to write that and other books as well as a play Night of January 16th which was revived as Penthouse Legend in New York in 1973 From 1951 until her death she worked full time as a writer and lecturer Her last completed book Philosophy Who Needs It will be published in November An associate Leonard Peikoff said last night that she also was about onequarter into the script for a television miniseries based on her novel Atlas Shrugged Her last public appearance was last November in New Orleans at a conference sponsored by the National Committee for Monetary Reform Miss Rand leaves no immediate survivors Visitors may call at the Frank E Campbell Funeral Home Madison Avenue at 81st Street tomorrow from 7 to 9 PM Burial will be on Tuesday at 1 PM at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla NY where her husband was buried in 1979

mills when the film Butterfly which is being presented by Mr Riklis and stars Miss Zadora was released It opened at local theaters over the weekend Actually the Pia Zadora publicity blitz preceded the films New York opening four weeks ago It started at the Cannes Film Festival where she was touted as the new sex kitten  a successor to Brigitte Bardot  and it continued when she received the Foreign Press Golden Globe Award as new star of the year The film from a novel by James M Cain deals with revenge murder and incest but the brouhaha attending Miss Zadoras presence in it has turned Butterfly into a media event She plays Kady a trashy teenager whose mother is a prostitute and whose runaway father is the caretaker of an abandoned silver mine owned by the family of the father of Kadys illegitimate son She finds her father and seduces him so that she can get at the silver in the mine Then the story really begins Miss Zadora has come to learn that its better to have a sensational

She feels shes entitled to that silver it isnt stealing I was able to disengage myself from my own morals and think the way she thought and truly believed what she believed Unlike other Cain heroines who murder their husbands she wouldnt hurt anyone But I know Cain is hokey and there are certain scenes where the audiences are roaring in the aisles Maybe theyre laughing where we never intended them

people in the desert And I enjoy seeing myself on the screen as Kady I like to walk into the theater and stand in the back and watch Theres nothing I have to qualify or justify she said in reply to questions about her husband Because of our age difference we make our time together more concentrated Theres always a possibility that one person is going to turn around and say This is not right for

The Nation in Summary; Conservatives Have Their Day On Busing Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-conservatives-have-their-day-on-busing-bill.html,The United States Senate last week accorded its new conservative bloc a first full victory  approval 57 to 37 of legislation limiting the authority of the Federal courts To some opponents of the measure the issue at hand  busing for school integration  mattered less than the precedent The bill would effectively bar the Justice Department as well as the judiciary from turning to busing an increasingly unpopular remedy that the Reagan Administration had already abandoned The bill Dale Bumpers Democrat from Arkansas said was part of a sinister continuing devious attack on the Constitution aimed at change through statute rather than amendment Propopents conceded that prospects for passage were dim the House leadership plans to bottle the bill up Theres a big hill to climb conceded Bennett Johnston the Louisiana Democrat who sponsored the court limitation provision in the Senate But they were pleased Jesse Helms the Carolina Republican who sponsored the Justice Department busing ban said he would press ahead on school prayer On abortion however he acknowledged that conservative strategy was still divided  Michael Wright and Caroline Rand Herron
"AYN RAND, 'FOUNTAINHEAD' AUTHOR, DIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/obituaries/ayn-rand-fountainhead-author-dies-234329.html,Ayn Rand the writer and philosopher of objectivism who espoused rational selfishness and capitalism unbound died yesterday morning at her home on East 34th Street She was 77 years old and a longtime resident of New York Miss Rand was perhaps best known for her novels The Fountainhead of 1943 for which she wrote the screenplay when it was turned into a movie with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal and Atlas Shrugged published in 1957 From the 1960s on she increasingly devoted herself to expounding her views more directly in such books as The Virtue of Selfishness 1965 and Capitalism The Unknown Ideal 1966 She also served as editor of The Objectivist a monthly journal from 1962 to 1971 and wrote The Ayn Rand Letter from 1971 to 1976 Her philosophy of objectivism holds that only individual ability and effort account for real achievement and that laissezfaire capitalism provides the optimal environment for talent Her view of selfishness as a virtue and altruism as a vice was a reversal of the traditional JudeoChristian ethic Man as a Heroic Being Her detractors decried objectivism as the deification of selfishness But Miss Rand its founder asserted that she had never advocated the pursuit of mindless selfinterest at all cost The concept of rational selfishness ran counter to altruism Miss Rand despised altruism as personal weakness and believed it responsible for much of the worlds dishonesty and misery My philosophy in essence Miss Rand once wrote is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute It was during the 1970s that Miss Rand giving lectures across the country attracted the attention of a new generation of students who believed in unfettered freedom and made her something of a cult figure in libertarian circles Miss Rand spurned the libertarians as a random collection of emotional hippiesoftheright who seek to play at politics without philosophy as she put it in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1976 She proclaimed herself a supporter of President Gerald R Ford because she wrote he was the most honest defender of free enterprise Opposed Reagan Ideas At the same time Miss Rand declared that she was profoundly opposed to Ronald Reagan and his Presidential ambitions Since he denies the right to abortion he cannot be a defender of any rights she wrote Since he has no program and no ideology to offer his likeliest motive for entering the Presidential race is power lust It remained unclear whether she changed her mind about Mr Reagan once he became President Miss Rand whose first name rhymed with pine shied away from reporters in recent years fearful that they were hostile to her philosophy and would distort her views Miss Rands views were much in demand in 1974 when President Richard M Nixon named Alan Greenspan the economics consultant to become chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers It turned out that Miss Rand had been the mentor and a 20year close friend to Mr Greenspun Miss Rand helped persuade the somewhat reluctant Mr Greenspan to join the Government so he could put their confidence in the capitalist spirit into action I helped Alan to analyze what was involved she told an interviewer that year But of course the decision was his own Born in Russia Ayn Rand was born Feb 2 1905 in St Petersburg now Leningrad and graduated from the University of Leningrad in 1924 two years before she came to the United States and headed for Hollywood to work as a movie extra and junior screenwriter At that time she met Charles Francis OConnor an artist on a movie set and married him in 1929 Mr OConnor died in 1979 in New York Miss Rand came to New York in 1929 to work for RKO Pictures starting as a filing clerk and becoming office head in the wardrobe department Through the 1930s she began her career as a screenwriter for Universal Pictures Paramount Pictures and MetroGoldwynMayer She also worked without pay in 1937 as a typist for Eli Jacques Kahn the architect in New York in order to do the research for her novel The Fountainhead The story was that of an architect later portrayed by Gary Cooper who blew up his construction project when he found that its design had been adulterated by others It also served as a vehicle for her presentation of her hero as the stubborn and lonely individualist As her novel took shape she continued as a screenwriter working six months each year under contract to the movie companies She took the next six months off to write that and other books as well as a play Night of January 16th which was revived as Penthouse Legend in New York in 1973 From 1951 until her death she worked full time as a writer and lecturer Her last completed book Philosophy Who Needs It will be published in November An associate Leonard Peikoff said last night that she also was about onequarter into the script for a television miniseries based on her novel Atlas Shrugged Her last public appearance was last November in New Orleans at a conference sponsored by the National Committee for Monetary Reform Miss Rand leaves no immediate survivors Visitors may call at the Frank E Campbell Funeral Home Madison Avenue at 81st Street tomorrow from 7 to 9 PM Burial will be on Tuesday at 1 PM at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla NY where her husband was buried in 1979
"ISSUE AND DEBATE; ADOLESCENTS, PARENTS AND BIRTH CONTROL",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/08/style/issue-and-debate-adolescents-parents-and-birth-control.html,Do parents have the right to know that contraceptive drugs or devices have been prescribed for their adolescent children Or do teenagers have the right to obtain birth control without the knowledge  and possible disapproval  of their parents Do they have the same rights as adults to confidentiality in sexrelated matters The Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a regulation that would require that parents be notified when minors treated in federally financed facilities receive prescription contraceptives It has generated angry debate over such fundamental and sensitive questions concerning the rights of parents and those of children and the role the Government ought to play in the way families deal with the sexuality of their children The Background In the past the issue of parental rights over adolescent sexuality has more often involved consent than notification and abortion rather than birth control Some cases have gone to court with decisions usually favoring minors right to abortion without parental approval The proposed regulation would require that notification letters be mailed to parents of unemancipated minors within 10 days of their being prescribed a birthcontrol drug or device in a facility receiving funds under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act An unemancipated minor is generally under 18 years of age and not married or in the armed services Providers of family planning may forgo the rule when notification would result in physical harm to the minor by a parent The Federal Bureau of Community Health Services reports that 11 million teenagers will be served under Title 10 this year but it is not known how many will obtain contraceptives or how many are older than 18 and thus not subject to the proposal The stated purpose of the regulation is to reinforce a recent amendment to the Public Health Service Act that encourages family participation in Title 10 projects In addition it would end the requirement that familyplanning programs grant services to minors based on their individual economic means rather than on family income The regulation was formally proposed late last month after a stormy hearing of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment Public comment will be taken by Marjory Mecklenburg Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs through April 23 After that barring changes or legal action the regulation will be issued in its final form and will have the effect of law For Notification Supporters of the regulation argue primarily that prescription contraceptives pose health risks and that parents ought to be informed of those risks because it is they who will ultimately deal with the consequences of contraceptives usage by adolescents Our minimum responsibility is to protect the health and in some cases the life of children receving prescriptions who may be at risk of embolism stroke and permanent sterility said Mrs Mecklenburg who is also director of the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs and who helped draft the regulation We are dealing with children many of them below 15 years she continued We cant allow things to be done to them in the name of confidentiality or privacy by professionals who arent reponsible for them no matter how wellmeaning those professionals may be They have no ongoing interest or relation with the child Although 82 percent of all teenagers on contraceptives are on the pill half dont return to the clinics for followup visits The real challenge now is to bring the teen and the parent back together again Of the contention by opponents of the regulation that notification of parents will drive teenagers away from contraception but not from sexual relations thereby increasing the risk of pregnancy Mrs Mecklenburg said That thinking assumes that if youre not on the pill you will be pregnant or you cant be on the pill and also be supported in your choice by your parents If parents and children communicate children will use contraception more effectively and will be more likely to delay sex As for those youngsters who refuse to allow notification Mrs Mecklenburg said They will still be able to go to clinics for counseling information and nonprescription methods without notification Connaught Marshner executive director of the National ProFamily Coalition an information clearinghouse for conservative organizations called the measure a first step toward the restoration of parental authority as well as a deterrent to sexual experience The argument that this will cause an increase in teenage pregnancy assumes that teenagers cant control their urges and nothing will stop them from having sex she said In fact if children had more discussion with parents they would hear their parents point of view and it would inspire them to control their feelings I hope that bringing the subject up for discussion will be constructive We cant avoid having tense discussions but a tense conversation is better than no conversation at all Against Notification While agreeing that the involvement of parents ought to be promoted opponents of the regulation maintain that mandating it is harmful and unrealistic They predict that if the parents right to know prevails over the adolescents right to privacy the teenagers will simply abandon birth control and become pregnant in vastly increasing numbers The joys of sex once discovered are rarely put away said Dr Luella Klein project director of the Maternal and Infant Care Clinic of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta Like many others she disputes the idea that birth control poses an unacceptable health risk Pregnancy is five times as risky for teens as is the pill she said Most teenagers do not even approach a clinic until they have been sexually active for six months to a year said Dr Adele D Hofmann director of the adolescent medical unit at New York University Medical CenterBellevue Hospital She cited a national sample of 4000 girls conducted at Johns Hopkins University If parents are notified six months after a girl has become active what will happen Dr Hofmann asked You cant tell me that a letter saying Dear mother Your daughter was in my office last week will be helpful Furthermore she said many teenagers will be unable to distinguish between notification which does not require parental permission and consent What they will fear is the prospect of what will happen if the parents know she went on Most of them are terrified of devaluation and rejection in their parents eyes Dr Klein considers the regulation to be discriminatory because it will affect girls but not boys and because affects only those dependent on Title 10 This is the wrong component of the population on whom to put the burden she said They are already unable to obtain abortions because the Federal Government no longer pays for them and now they wont be able to get birth control The Outlook There is agreement on all sides of the issue that the regulation will ultimately be tested in the courts Were planning to challenge it with two lawsuits said Janet Benshoof director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Reproductive Freedom Project Were hoping to prevent it from going into effect There is simply no real answer to the question of childrens rights versus parents rights said Prof Martin Guggenheim director of the Juvenile Rights Clinic of the New York University School of Law There is no stated principle in law that parents must know what a child is doing but they do have constitutional rights to control some details of a childs upbringing I think this will end up in the Supreme Court
A 'New Federalism' Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/10/opinion/a-new-federalism-abortion.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote this week on a bit of New Federalism that is the special project of Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah He would amend the Constitution to restore the power of state legislatures over abortion rights The amendment is the most ingenious attack so far by those who are working to overturn the Supreme Courts 1973 decision upholding the right to an earlyterm abortion The Hatch measure would eradicate this constitutional protection and return abortion policy to the political arena both in state capitals and Congress The essential device is an odd twist on the theme of states rights Both the Federal and state governments would be allowed to legislate restrictions on abortion But state laws would prevail over Federal law whenever they were more restrictive The measure aims not to insure the right to a safe legal abortion but to limit it as much as statebystate politics can manage The Constitution can be and has been amended to overthrow unpopular Supreme Court decisions So the apparent legality of the Hatch approach has become the focus of antiabortion forces Their only other major effort in Washington now is for the socalled human life statute which would attempt to ban abortions more directly It would declare human life to begin at the moment of conception and thus try to make abortion prosecutable as murder That approach however is widely expected to be struck down as unconstitutional which is one reason for Senator Hatchs alternative By comparison it seems moderate and even tolerant But the Hatch amendment would at best take the country back to the time before the Supreme Court ruling when legal and safe abortions were available only to women who could travel to states that permitted them and afford the sizable fee It has been nine years since the Court placed the right of women not to bear an unwanted child alongside other familial rights protected against state interference Experience has shown that this protection is beneficial to both individuals and society A majority of Americans support that protection and understand its benefits Reverting to intrusive state restrictions is an odd project for conservatives
60-SECOND DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/10/us/60-second-debate.html,The Senate passed an amendment last week that would prohibit Federal courts from ordering the busing of students more than five miles or l5 minutes from their homes to promote classroom integration The measure now goes to the House of Representatives where it is almost certain to become a major issue Two House members with strong views on the subject were asked to comment on the question Should Congress forbid Federal courts to use busing as a means to desegregate public schools John M Ashbrook Republican of Ohio The time has come for Americans to decide whether the constitutional doctrine of checks and balances applies to the Federal courts Those backing courtordered busing insist that courts must be allowed to do anything they choose if they say that the Constitution requires it Liberals have historically called for limiting courts when they ruled against them But on busing they insist that even a constitutional amendment would be a danger to their idea that the Federal judiciary and the Constitution are the same thing No one seriously argues that those who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment intended racial quotas that busing works or that the people want it Yet they insist that the peoples will should be paralyzed because judges have said that the Constitution requires what those who wrote it did not intend and people do not want This is their concept of constitutional democracy Checks and balances apply to all three branches of government not just to Congress and the President When the courts abuse their powers it is the duty of Congress to check that abuse If the courts are the Constitution then the doctrine of checks and balances is a sham Constitutional democracy cannot exist where one branch of government is the Constitution Nor can it operate under a system which punishes schoolchildren for their grandfathers intention to discriminate Robert Kastenmeier Democrat of Wisconsin For the first time in our nations history the power of the Federal judiciary to fully protect Consitutional rights would be limited if the HelmsJohnston amendment were to become law I do not doubt that the busing of schoolchildren is an unpopular solution to remedy unconstitutional racial segregation However the Supreme Court our final arbiter of fundamental questions has repeatedly held that the Constitution requires as a last resort that pupils be assigned to schools in a manner that eliminates racial segregation There is frequently no other remedy available for this constitutional violation and courts must be free to use the remedy of busing when it is necessary This amendment is thus an attack on the essential role of the Federal judiciary to interpret the Constitution and order remedies of violations This amendment eliminates the sole effective constitutional remedy to correct the wrong inherent in many of these cases Hence I believe it is merely one step removed from the myriad bills pending to remove court jurisdiction over constitutional claims such as those raised in abortion and school prayer cases I warn against any legislative intent to constrain the Federal judiciary To emasculate the vital function of an institution so essential to our liberty can have only disastrous consequences Are we not better served by an independent fearless judiciary strong enough to order those remedies the Constitution requires regardless of their popularity I believe we are and that this amendment is an assault on such a judiciary I will fully resist its passage by the House
"ABORTION CURBS ENDORSED, 10-7, BY SENATE PANEL",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/us/abortion-curbs-endorsed-10-7-by-senate-panel.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would enable Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortion By a vote of 10 to 7 the panel endorsed a measure sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah that seeks to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision upholding the right of women to seek abortions The vote today marked the first time that a full Congressional committee had supported an antiabortion amendment and opened the way for a fullfledged floor debate on the issue TwoThirds Majority Needed Senator Hatchs proposed amendment would give Congress and the states concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion State laws that were more restrictive than national laws would prevail In seeking to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion the amendment says A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution Constitutional amendments must be approved by twothirds of each house of Congress and ratified by the legislatures of threefourths of the states Because of the controversial nature of the abortion issue the Hatch measure is expected to produce considerable debate and possibly some delaying tactics by its opponents On the House side a similar measure has been sponsored by Representative John M Ashbrook Republican of Ohio No action on the measure has been taken by the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional aides say privately that they expect the House to wait for further Senate action before taking up the abortion issue Dr JC Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee termed todays vote a major victory and a milestone for groups seeking to bar abortion in the United States but he acknowledged that the Hatch amendment faced a tough fight in the Senate partly because some antiabortion forces opposed it on the ground that it did not go far enough The National Council of Catholic Bishops which endorsed the proposed amendment late last year said the committees action was an auspicious event for the cause of the unborn But such groups as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the National Abortion Rights Action League and the American Civil Liberties Union strongly criticized the vote saying in part that the measure failed to take into account surveys showing that most Americans favored a degree of abortion rights for women Repression by Extremists We see this as enlarging the battle over individual and civil rights said Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood We see this as part of a broader agenda of repression by extremists by those who are attempting to define morality and to enact laws that reflect their narrow interpretation of what is moral Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the abortion rights league said Every major public opinion survey shows that the majority of American people are opposed to the amendment She termed the vote a setback but not a defeat The committees vote did not follow party lines and several Senators who supported the measure expressed strong reservations about it Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the committee and Alan K Simpson a Republican from Wyoming said they would try to amend the proposal on the Senate floor and leave abortion rights entirely to each state Such a step would be anathema to most of the righttolife groups that want an abortion ban as national policy Biden Terms Vote Difficult Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware said that the vote was the most difficult one he had made as a Senator and that as a Roman Catholic he was not sure that he had a right to impose his views on an issue that would affect the entire nation He then voted in favor of the proposed amendment In addition to Mr Biden one other Democrat Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona supported the proposed amendment Besides Mr Hatch Mr Thurmond and Mr Simpson other Republican Senators who voted for the measure were Paul Laxalt of Nevada Bob Dole of Kansas John P East of North Carolina Charles E Grassley of Iowa and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama Democrats who voted against the measure were Senators Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts Robert C Byrd of West Virgina Patrick J Leahy of Vermont Max Baucus of Montana and Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio Two Republican Senators Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Charles Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland opposed the measure In urging approval of his proposed amendment Senator Hatch said repeatedly that the measure puts us in the middle between the two extremes dominating the debate The proposal itself is one of several before Congress including a measure sponsored by Mr East and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would define life as beginning at conception
MAN IN THE NEWS; WILLIAMS'S CHIEF ACCUSER IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/nyregion/man-in-the-news-williams-s-chief-accuser-in-senate.html,In late 1979 when Senator Malcolm Wallop agreed to fill a Republican seat on the Senates Select Committee on Ethics he recalls Howard H Baker Jr the Senate minority leader at the time told him It should be an easy tour The committee had already disposed of the cases of two errant senators Herman E Talmadge of Georgia and Edward Brooke of Massachusetts There was nothing left on the committee calendar Mr Wallop said but routine bureaucratic matters such things as advising senators on what outside activities might present ethical concerns The committee is the Senates security blanket in normal times said Mr Wallop a 49yearold Yaleeducated rancher from Wyoming By early 1981 when the Senate came under Republican control and Mr Wallop took over the chairmanship of the ethics panel the case of Senator Harrison A Williams Jr Democrat of New Jersey had swept the routine business off the committee agenda It presented the Senate with the difficult choice of what to do about the only member of its chamber to be convicted in the Abscam investigation The verdict of the ethics committee was unanimous Mr Williams should be expelled from the Senate After a week of painful and sometimes bitter debate the Senate is nearing a vote on the expulsion resolution If it approves the measure Mr Williams would become the first member of the Senate to suffer such a fate since 1862 when Jesse D Bright Democrat of Indiana was removed from office for his role in selling guns to the Confederacy during the Civil War Mr Wallop who argued the case against Mr Williams on the Senate floor this week did not match the eloquence of Senator Howell Heflin Democrat of Alabama Senator Heflin as vice chairman of the ethics panel delivered what many considered the most powerful argument for expelling Mr Williams But among his colleagues both Democrats and Republicans there is appreciation for Mr Wallops leadership of the ethics committee on this difficult case Although Mr Wallop and Mr Williams are divided by party political philosophy and geography there are no indications that the ethics chairman acted in a partisan way in handling the case This is not and never has been a partisan matter Mr Wallop said in an interview today I have not even asked any senator where he stood on the case in an effort to avoid any appearance that I was trying to sway votes A Western Perspective The Senator says that once the Williams case is behind him he looks forward to devoting more time to the issues that have been his main interest since coming to Washington  energy taxation and publiclands policy all of which he views from a Western perspective Malcolm Wallop was elected to the Senate in 1976 defeating Gale McGee the Democratic incumbent Born in New York City on Feb 27 1933 the son of English parents and educated at Yale Mr Wallop does not fit the stereotype of the Western rancher Though he is related to English earls and his grandfather sat jointly in the Wyoming legislature and Englands House of Lords the Senator is a thirdgeneration American He is divorced and the father of four children His campaign advertisments portrayed him as a rugged Westerner often showing him on horseback and as a conservative who would take the Sagebrush Rebellion to Washington One ad designed to protest a Federal regulation requiring a certain number of portable toilets for farm workers showed a cowboy riding his horse with one awkwardly strapped to the saddle Mr Wallop said he first heard the news of Mr Williamss involvement in the Abscam investigation while changing planes in Puerto Rico Upon his return to Washington he said he urged his colleagues at a Republican policy lunch not to be hasty in judging Mr Williams on the basis of news reports He added that he had tried to give the Senator every benefit of the doubt until the evidence before the committee became overwhelming The committee did not want this result he said and we tried to find him faultless But the evidence was too great There is no other judgment available in the Senate but our own At one point he said he had heard a couple of Republicans suggest the possibility of the Republican leadership postponing a vote on the Williams case until the new Republican Governor of New Jersey could take office in early 1982 giving him a chance to appoint a member of his own party to Mr Williamss seat I said I would resign if that ever happened Mr Wallop said Senator Baker of course would not have had anything to do with such a plan and in fact he tried to get the matter before the Senate before New Jersey changed governors Mr Wallop who said the ethics committee has consumed more of his time than any other matter since coming to the Senate has built a solid conservative record in his first term On some issues however he has parted company with the new right For example he does not oppose all abortions and he favors reclamation of stripmined land With the Williams case coming to an end Mr Wallop said he was counting the days until the end of his term next January on the ethics panel It is not a very pleasant task he said

conservatives or at least that faction that is trying to strip the courts of jurisdiction over such social issues as abortion busing and school prayer This is not a conservative concept believe me Mr Goldwater said of the campaign on the courts Ive spent my whole life railing against those who use any excuse to get around the law or the Constitution The old Arizona battler who at one point seemed to be surrendering to age gimpy limbs and younger ideologues has suddenly begun to shoot holes through a lot of ideas that are described as conservative Abortion he says should be a private matter the military budget should be subject to greater scrutiny arms control might not be a bad idea Here is a man who stays true to certain basic principles yet seems willing to learn as conditions change around him Dislikes Busing But    The Senator dislikes busing as a means to school integration but he dislikes the attacks on judicial independence even more As he puts it How long before someone says that the courts cant hand down decisions on drunk driving or rape or murder The effort to restrict judicial authority won a major victory early this month when the Senate ended an eightmonth filibuster and passed a bill that would prevent the courts from ordering busing for more than five miles or 15 minutes from a childs home But the bill has been blocked in the House and Mr Goldwater thinks that the Senate has had a stomachful of social issues We hope we can stop the others he said I dont think anyone on this floor wants another fight especially over abortion My wife founded Planned Parenthood in Arizona and shes been beating me to death on the subject These sorts of comments pinch a throbbing nerve in the conservative camp One of the foremost publications of the right Human Events recently printed an article headlined Goldwater Dismays Conservatives Again And Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah said pointedly Goldwater has never been known as a constitutional expert Term Ends in 86 In response the Arizona Republican tells his critics where to go And while such talk is not ordinarily heard in the Capitol normally a palace of politeness Mr Goldwater is not an ordinary lawmaker candidate for President Senator for 26 years the man who got Ronald Reagan into politics a professional curmudgeon who has never put tact or delicacy high on his list of desireable political graces He intends to retire after his current term ends in 1986 and at the age of 73 he figures he can say anything he wants When you dont have to worry how people at home will vote he said you feel much more free to tell what you really think Mr Goldwater is at that stage in life where he is called a statesman by many people Others call him a crank And when he barely won reelection in 1980 his opponents muttered that he had lost his edge and overstayed his time Some people say that hes too old that he doesnt know what hes talking about said an aide to the Republican leadership But I dont think thats true He knows exactly what hes doing and he doesnt care who he offends at this point He Makes People Think His chief value said Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr a liberal Republican from Maryland is that he makes people stop and think This hardly means that Mr Goldwater has been a closet liberal all these years In his own mind he has been completely consistent He just does not like any government from the right or the left to intrude on peoples lives Rather than moving with the ideological tides said Senator Mathias hes clearly trying to keep his sights on the same landmarks that have always been important to him Besides Mr Goldwater believes you cant legislate morality even if you want to He says he learned that lesson as a young man in Prohibition when he brewed illicit beer for his father He fears that the conservative revolution led by Ronald Reagan could collapse under its own moral selfimportance I dont want to see conservatism join with the ills of liberalism he said Disturbed by Religious Link Barry Goldwater is a true Westerner a man who prizes free will and open spaces and he is particularly perturbed by the linkage of conservative politics with religious leaders In his view they have prixfixe moral menus no substitutions allowed They say that you have to go along with them 100 percent or by God theyre going to get you the Senator asserted Thats wrong thats the way the Communists talk In recent years Mr Goldwater had virtually dropped from sight in the Senate He had the worst attendance record in the entire body and was viewed more as a figure of history than of current consequence What changed all that was the rightwing attack last summer on Sandra Day OConnor the Arizona judge who was the first woman nominated for the Supreme Court The Senator was irked He came charging out of the chute like a young bronco with a burr under his saddle and his continuing fulminations against what he sees as rightwing assaults on the Constitution have garnered wide attention Nothing Ive done since I ran for President has gotten as much press notice as this he admitted Suspicious of the Press Like many older conservatives Mr Goldwater has always been suspicious of the Washington press corps and he chides younger Republicans who literally cant go to the bathroom without issuing a press release But no politician likes being ignored and the old man as he refers to himself clearly likes all the fuss In fact it apparently has given him a shot of adrenalin and that cannot be very good news to the military brass who come before his Tactical Warfare subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee these days Mr Goldwater is a lifelong backer of greater military preparedness and today he reinterated his opposition to sizable cuts in the defense budget But he finds himself scared to death by the exploding cost of weaponry and is demanding greater efforts by the Pentagon to save money This sworn enemy of Godless Communism is even ready to approach Moscow with some form of arms limitation pact Lets Sit Down Lets sit down and say Were both in trouble  he remarked Were spending too damn much on things we dont need Lets talk One of Mr Goldwaters prime targets is the Apache helicopter a weapon made in his home state They think that will influence me he sneered Hell they could build it in my living room and I wont go along till they get the price down And this longtime darling of free enterprise has it in for the arms merchants as well Much of the blame has to be put on the manufacturers he says They realize they finally have a President whos willing to spend money on arms and theyre saying Hell lets get in on this its a pretty good deal  Barry Goldwater is a free man And he is not going gently into the night
U.S. HEALTH OFFICIALS ENDORSE STRONGER CIGARETTE WARNINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/12/us/us-health-officials-endorse-stronger-cigarette-warnings.html,The Reagan Administration today endorsed putting tougher health labels on cigarette packages to warn smokers of specific disease dangers they face Dr Edward N Brandt Jr the Assistant Secretary for Health in the Department of Health and Human Services told a House subcommittee on health that he has reservations about the bill under consideration But he said his differences were not significant The bill would require that one of five labels be used on cigarette packs and in print advertising The labels would cite such hazards as lung cancer emphysema miscarriages and birth defects Dr Brandt said that the stronger health warnings would increase the publics knowledge of the hazards of smoking adding If we can emphasize to young people not only the fact that it is harmful to health but also specific illnesses well be more effective Who Should Set Wording Disputed But he disagreed for example whether the Secretary of Health and Human Services instead of Congress as called for in the proposed bill should determine the wording of the labels Persuading people not to smoke is a high priority of the Reagan Administration Dr Brandt said The present warning label was put on cigarette packs and in advertisements after the United States Surgeon Generals 1964 report on smoking and health In their testimony Dr Brandt and Dr C Everett Koop the Surgeon General reviewed the Government findings that blame smoking for 340000 deaths a year and that call it the chief preventable cause of illness and premature death in the nation The five proposed labels are these  Warning Cigarette smoking may cause death from heart disease cancer or emphysema  Warning Cigarette smoking is the No 1 cause of emphysema and lung cancer  Smokers No matter how long you have smoked quitting now greatly reduces the risks to your health  Warning Cigarette smoking by pregnant women may result in birth defects or spontaneous abortion  Warning The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking by pregnant women may result in miscarriage premature births or child weight deficiencies The current label says Warning The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health
HOUSE LEADERSHIP ACCUSED OF DELAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/12/us/house-leadership-accused-of-delay.html,All 54 Republican freshmen in the House accused the Democratic leadership today of deliberately delaying new legislation in this session of Congress particularly on budget matters and warned that the legislative process was dangerously close to faltering In a letter to Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr the firstterm legislators threatened to try to block an Easter recess unless Congress made substantial progress toward adopting a budget for the fiscal year 1983 In a news conference this morning Representative Eugene Johnston of North Carolina a member of the Budget Committee summed up the groups criticism when he said Were playing games thats all were doing In response Democratic leaders called the move pure showboating and said that the Republicans were running for the woods to escape responsibility for President Reagans economic program which they all supported last year Theyre concerned and theyre worried because of the reaction of the American people Mr ONeill told reporters This is just a political ploy on their part Work Behind the Scenes Representative James R Jones the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Budget Committee said he was consulting members of both parties in an attempt to produce a bipartisan budget before the deadline for committee action April 15 Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader agreed that a lot of serious work is going on behind the scenes according to his spokesman Mike Johnson Asked if Mr Michel was dissociating himself from his junior colleagues the spokesman said In a certain sense yes I guess he is The verbal skirmishing that echoed across Capitol Hill today is all part of the political maneuvering that always intensifies as Congressional elections approach And a major goal of both parties right now is to pin the blame for the declining economy on the other side Many firstterm Republican Congressmen agree that Mr Reagans budget proposal is an imperfect document in the words of Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota and should be changed to reduce the projected deficit of about 964 billion But they are frustrated by the fact that the only game in town is beating up on Reagans budget as Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip said Pressure on Democrats Todays statement the Republicans involved acknowledged was designed to pressure the Democrats to come forward with their own plan and give the Republicans a target to shoot at The Democrats say they will eventually produce a budget alternative but they are clearly in no hurry Theyre the Government Mr ONeill asserted We just happen to control the House The debate also reveals the tortuous pace of legislative activity since Congress reconvened in January The Republican freshmen said that the House had met for only 22 days this year and that most of those sessions conducted no business One bill adopted this week authorized the sale of an old pier in Hoboken NJ and most legislation reaching the House floor has been of similar significance Speaker ONeill observed that legislation costs money and that in an age of retrenchment there was little desire to advance new spending programs Some of the social issues such as abortion and busing for school desegregation that have filled the legislative calendar in the Senate have been bottled up in the House by liberal committee chairmen Cant Have It Both Ways There is just no legislation pending the Speaker said There hasnt been anything coming from the White House The Republicans have been yammering for 10 years that there is too much legislation reaching the floor and they cant have it both ways Mr Lott the Republican whip said that the biggest reason for the slow pace of legislation was the growing predominance of the budget process on the agenda Spending ceilings for 1982 have already been reached and any new outlays would require a waiver of the budget rules The levels for 1983 have not yet been set and committees are reluctant to enact new programs until they are in place We have almost reached gridlock in the House Mr Lott said The budget process has got us by the nap of the neck Under current law Congress is required to pass two budget resolutions a tentative target in May and a binding guideline in September Mr Lott said some members were working on a proposal to streamline the process and require only one resolution every year

MAINSTREAM U.S. EVANGELICALS SURGE IN PROTESTANT INFLUENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/us/mainstream-us-evangelicals-surge-in-protestant-influence.html,Often overshadowed by fundamentalism and shunned by church liberals the mainstream of evangelical Christians has emerged as the most powerful new force in American Protestantism These evangelicals mostly moderate in theology and politics have been growing in numbers for years But now they are strengthening their own institutions and making deep inroads in the 50yearold liberal leadership of the major Protestant denominations The signs of evangelical vitality are seen in the robustness of student movements in the enthusiasm of lay people and in the clergy which is wellequipped by education and outlook to bring the historic tenets of the Protestant faith to bear on 20thcentury problems Another sign is a recent decision by the Harvard Divinity School a pillar of Protestant liberalism to establish a chair in evangelical studies Other oldline seminaries are expanding in similar ways The influence of leading evangelical publications has expanded and a large network of professional educational and lay groups amplifies the evangelical voice Commitment to Christ In essence evangelicals stand between liberals and fundamentalists They stress a personal commitment to Jesus confidence in the Bible and enthusiasm for spreading the word and seeking converts Evangelicals tend to hold in high importance the Second Coming of Christ the saving act of Christs death the Virgin Birth and the physical Resurrection In comparison liberals do not hold so uniformly to this set of beliefs and are less absolutist and literalminded on questions of doctrine While evangelicals share many beliefs with fundamentalists and the lines sometimes blur the fundamentalists tend to be more absolutist in their approach to Christian theology Evangelicals look about them and say that if liberals have lapsed into agnosticism and doubt then fundamentalists have erred toward closedmindedness They Could Take Command Some experts believe that the evangelicals could take the leadership of Protestantism But the outcome depends on whether evangelicals can overcome their internal splits and grasp the opportunity Many evangelical leaders see a great need for fencemending so that the theological and political moderates who are in the overwhelming majority among evangelicals can advance at a time when fundamentalists remain a beleaguered minority and liberals continue in a prolonged slump This readjustment of the nations Protestant religious balance fixes on the quest for a middle way between fundamentalism and liberalism At least 40 million Protestants in the United States consider themselves religious conservatives Though the moderate evangelicals are divided from fundamentalists on basic views they are often incorrectly lumped together under the mantle of conservatism The nonevangelical world would throw us into one big pot said Dr Marvin Wilson professor of Biblical and theological studies at Gordon College in Wenham Mass a center of moderation The nuances arent coming through Hope for Change for the Better Evangelicalism was the hallmark of 19thcentury Protestantism It was a blend of Reformation doctrine exuberance for the democratic ethos and hope that people and societies could change for the better under Gods will Evangelicals today maintain they are on this historical trunk line Since the 1980 elections when fundamentalists such as the Rev Jerry Falwell put effort and money into a campaign to influence voters the moderates have felt an increased need to press their own cause Many evangelicals and fundamentalists have made vigorous efforts to define themselves as separate from each other Relations have become strained Even before this however the moderate tide was rising as education and worldly success became more widespread among evangelicals Leaders of liberal church groups among them Bishop James Armstrong president of the National Council of Churches have indicated the importance of the trend by calling for steps to close the gap with the evangelicals Far more mutuality is being acknowledged said Bishop Armstrong the United Methodist Bishop of Indiana There are responsible persons on both sides and we need to pay attention to each other and to listen Moderate evangelicalism burst on the public scene in 1976 when as a Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter defined himself as a born again Christian focusing attention on his denomination the Southern Baptist Convention But the evangelical tradition embraces many doctrines and attitudes It is open to science emphasizes rational faith and looks fervently to history particularly the themes of the Reformation 12 Streams Are Defined Dr Timothy Smith a church historian at Johns Hopkins University believes there are 12 streams of evangelicals Among them are Pentecostals members of transplanted European ethnic churches and Baptists in addition to the millions of convervatives in the liberal denominations Fundamentalism Dr Smith noted in an article written in conjunction with Cullen Murphy in a recent issue of the Woodrow Wilson Quarterly is merely a subculture within mainstream evangelicalism a relatively young and extreme movement within an older moderate one In the view of many moderates the fundamentalists tried to take over the evangelical reins in the last decade but suffered losses that left them weakened and dispirited Meanwhile bitterness lingered from the Scopes Trial in 1925 which pitted the two wings liberal and fundamental against each other over the issue of evolution Until recently this hostility obscured the distinctiveness of the moderates and their rise in the years since World War II Hatfield a Prominent Figure Prominent moderates include Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon who has helped instill a social conscience in the movement the former Presidential candidate John B Anderson Dr David Hubbard president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena Calif Prof Richard Lovelace a Presbyterian theology professor at GordonConwell Seminary in Wenham Mass and Dr Ronald Sider a theologian at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia Supported by a variety of institutions among them Wheaton College in Illinois Fuller in Pasadena several strong parachurch youth and service organizations evangelicalism has adherents dispersed among thousands of local churches Increasingly they share the belief that the pursuit of social justice is a central part of the Christian mission Senator Hatfield said he has been encouraged by the increasing awareness of social ministry among evangelicals adding For a long time we were so busy proclaiming the Gospel that there was no time to be concerned about people In many areas of evangelical church life attention has turned to problems such as poverty and the arms race once addressed almost exclusively by liberals A Collision Course Feared Political activism by fundamentalists has created religious conflicts over these social issues At first I thought we were on a collision course Senator Hatfield said referring to the tensions between moderates and fundamentalists but added that he had high hopes that some bridges could be built While most moderates consider the Scriptures the highest authority on matters of faith they show relatively little taste for defending every passage as literal truth On these and other matters change has brought about disagreements It is not a closed system said Dr Arthur Holmes chairman of the philosophy department at Wheaton College It is a heritage stemming from mainstream Protestantism which has maintained the authority of Scripture Theres room to move around The College Church of Wheaton illustrates the character of the moderates Under the guidance of the Rev Kent Hughes a former Quaker the church membership has swelled 48 percent in three years to 1200 and this year raised nearly 600000 half of which went for missions outside the church Most of the newcomers are couples in their early 30s and there are congregants with PhDs Mr Hughes says the suburban Chicago congregants are very heterogenous and prefer strong Biblical teaching combined with a bit of liturgy WillyNilly Into Mainstream Dr Martin E Marty the church historian at the University of Chicago wrote in a book The Public Church To such evangelicals it must be said that evangelicalism has willynilly moved into the mainstream Growth has come from a base of economic resources as evangelicals attain greater affluence from booming publishing houses such as Word in Waco Tex and Zondervan in Grand Rapids Mich and from the high quality of a lengthening list of evangelical colleges Christianity Today an evangelical journal with a weekly circulation of 140000 is now by far the nations most widely read religious periodical five recently formed associations bring evangelicals together around such specialties as science law and psychology and a group of new scholarly journals including Christian Scholars Review and Theological Students Fellowship Bulletin have provided media for the development of evangelical thought We want a dialogue with the wider world said Dr Marvin Wilson Fundamentalism is closed but we want to be on the same level as scholars in any field The impact is felt in the old denominations such as the Presbyterian and Methodist churches where more and more ministers and lay people identify themselves as evangelicals organized to achieve their religious and political goals It is also revealed in the growing populations of church groups such as Southern Baptists that are evangelical by definition Popularity on College Campuses As liberalism has fallen into general disfavor evangelical fortunes have soared On college campuses moderate evangelical groups such as InterVarsity Christian Fellowship attract by far the most students to religion in providing models for church growth they are showing similar initiative and in the foreign mission field they are notably leading the way Moreover future generations of evangelical leaders are being trained at the nations top seminaries Leaders of the mainstream denominations have begun to take notice Top liberal seminaries such as Princeton Yale Union and Harvard have enrolled increasing numbers of evanglicals and have begun hiring faculty members from similar backgrounds Dr George Rupp dean of Harvard Divinity School regards the proposed new Harvard chair which some have suggested be named for the Rev Billy Graham the evangelical as an important barometer of the recognition that moderates are receiving Im very much in favor of this professorship Dr Rupp said There ought to be an evangelical representative on our faculty He Sees a Significant Factor The Rev Richard G Hutcheson a Southern Presbyterian who studied the implications of this trend on mainstream denominations concluded that moderate evangelicals are a very significant factor that mainstream Protestantism must accommodate But neither Mr Hutcheson nor other analysts predict smooth transition I see tensions accelerating in the mainstream denominations said Dr Donald Bloesch a leading Presbyterian evangelical theologian who teaches at the University of Dubuques Theological Seminary in Iowa The liberal establishment will be fighting back As the moderate voice gets stronger Dr Bloesch said I predict even more tension The pace appears more rapid on the West Coast Fuller Seminary founded in 1946 by the popular radio evangelist Charles Fuller is not only one of the nations largest theological schools but also in the opinion of many church experts the most influential 60 Go Into Parish Work in State At least 60 percent of Fullers graduates enter parish work in California by far the largest number into the ministries of the United Presbyterian and American Baptist churches Californias Presbyterian churches among others are now heavily weighted in an evangelical direction GordonConwell is becoming a similar factor in New England Talks between liberal Harvard and neighboring GordonConwell have been under way and last semester Harvards best known liberal theologian Dr Harvey Cox taught a course on Evangelicalism and Social Action with Dr Stephen Mott of GordonConwell Union Theological Seminary in New York City has likewise taken a interest in evangelical professors and has initiated dialogue with GordonConwell Dr Donald Shriver president of Union said I invited them partly because Im uncomfortable not talking with people who are part of the church Among the benefits of the contact Dr Shriver said was that evangelicals call us back to being faithful to theological tasks and spiritual dimensions of our lives Liberals have likewise been impressed by social activism among evangelicals Led by moderates Evangelicals for Social Action was begun in 1978 and now has 20 chapters with a mailing list of 3500 High on the list of concerns are such issues as disarmament justice for the poor ecology human rights and opposition to abortion In the past activism on most of these fronts was the task of liberals Now many moderates are leading Progress Toward Agenda Is Seen Dr Sider of Eastern Baptist Seminary said he believed evangelicals still tended to challenge society too little but asserted there had been progress toward an evangelical social agenda concerning justice a new conceptual agreement that it is what we should be doing In seeking greater roles the evangelicals have problems with Biblical and theological squabbles among themselves and the old feud with fundamentalists Evangelical leadership has come to the fore said Dr Carl FH Henry evangelicalisms foremost theologian who is former president of the American Theological Society But it seems to me that unless the evangelical community through dialogue and reflection forges a public coalition before the end of the decade then the evangelical egress into the public arena could be dissipated Dr Henry whose work God Revelation and Authority has been a widely read evangelical theological volumne cees four challenges One is to settle the question of Biblical authority which he says is a shambles a second is to organize a solid political alternative to Mr Falwells fundamentalist Moral Majority a third is to provide alternatives to the fundamentalistdominated religious media and fourth to offer a moderate approach to the question of divine creation that steers clear of the creation science view Conflict Dr Henry said could leave us worse than when we came out of the subculture Variety of Opinions Supported Dr Hubbard president of Fuller is among the many moderates who believe that evangelicals can acknowledge a variety of opinions and that further efforts must be made to produce sound scholarship While leadership appears to be the key to further progress there is wide agreement that the movement has come a long way Evangelicalism looks as if its shaping things spectacularly more than it was 20 years ago Dr Marsden said As an historian I dont see this as altogether surprising After all evangelicalism grew up in a democratic society and fits into the American mentality It has shaped America at the same time They have affinities for each other

REPUBLICAN PARLEY BURIES DISCORD TO BACK REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/us/republican-parley-buries-discord-to-back-reagan.html,Supporters of President Reagan at an annual highlevel but informal Republican conference resisted critics of his budget today and voted to hail the progress to date of his economic program The ayes have it with a few mutterings William E Brock 3d Mr Reagans special trade representative said in announcing the voice vote at the fifth annual Tidewater Conference The event is a meeting of members of Congress Cabinet members and statewide elected Republican officeholders which is designed to bring Republicans together on issues Representative Carroll A Campbell Jr of South Carolina presented the resolution supporting Mr Reagans fiscal policies Mr Campbells resolution also promised to seek a balanced budget by 1985 endorsed a constitutional amendment to require the Federal budget to be balanced and pledged continued support for income tax cuts passed by Congress last year Some Discordant Notes Some of the Republican lawmakers at this meeting have been among those in Congress who along with most Democrats have attacked Mr Reagans fiscal year 1983 budget and its projected 915 billion deficit In todays session restive Republicans from Northern districts did much of the talking especially in offstage comments to reporters But when Representative Joel Pritchard of Washington suggested adding a line to the resolution saying spending increases in all budget sectors including defense must be restrained he was accused by Representative Henson Moore of Louisiana of suggesting that we get into a confrontation with the President Mr Pritchards move was defeated and none of his moderate colleagues spoke up to support him Senator Mark Andrews of North Dakota scoffed at the resolution as this wonderful pablum He asserted that Mr Reagan doesnt want to admit that both his tax cuts and military budgets were too big And Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota called the Campbell proposal a turkey House Members Dominate Talks Twelve Senators three Governors and five Cabinet members attended the meeting but the House members of whom there were about 90 dominated the discussions Talks were more inhibited than in recent years when the participants concentrated on finding the most effective language with which to attack the Carter Administration Mr Reagan in a filmed appearance shown last night between dinner and community singing called on participants to debate vigorously in order to help Republicans remain the party of ideas The politicians also debated the question of limiting Federal court powers to rule on social issues before voting 46 to 29 to table all proposed resolutions on the matter Representative William E Dannemeyer of California led the assault on the courts asserting that Supreme Court Justices masquerading as frustrated legislators had made social policy on organized prayer in schools school busing for desegregation and abortion He advocated a resolution calling for curtailing Supreme Court jurisdiction in such issues for the purpose of restoring the Constitution to its original purpose Representative James M Collins of Texas supported him saying If judges cant understand the Constitution its the responsibility of the Legislature to explain it to them But Representative Thomas N Kindness of Ohio said the whole issue divides us more than it unites us Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said The Court makes the final decision on what is constitutional issue and what is constitutional jurisdiction We ought to leave the balance of power where it now stands The closest the group came to challenging Mr Reagan was a resolution that stated The Federal Government has substantial responsibility for the income assistance programs for all Americans
READERS REPLY ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/nyregion/l-readers-reply-on-abortion-238945.html,We believe that the recent article TeenAgers Abortions Increasing on Long Island gives a slightly skewed picture of the real situation re teenage pregnancy and though the number of pregnant teenagers who terminated their pregnancies was on a steady rise since 1971 it decreased in 1980 The percentage of decrease in Suffolk County was greater than in Nassau but still it decreased in both counties In Suffolk County we have over 121000 females between the ages of 10 and 19 Surely our statistics are significant to a Long Island story Had I been called Id have shared the following information Teenagers had fewer abortions in Suffolk County in 1980 For the six years prior to 1980 our teenage pregnancy rate held constant  around 3200 In 1980 the New York State Health Department reported a drop of 15 percent Since the pregnancy rate for all women in Suffolk County dropped only 4 12 percent it is in the teenage population that the change is seen In addition the rate of pregnancy of girls under 14 years of age dropped 20 percent The abortion rate in Suffolk County has dropped as well Among those 10 to 19 years old it dropped 24 percent with a decline of 45 percent among those under 14 Last year Planned Parenthood of Suffolk County provided pregnancy screening tests and options counseling to over 1800 women together the two Planned Parenthoods on Long Island saw 3000 women of childbearing age who thought they were pregnant and helped them make their own decisions about their pregnancies outcome In addition Planned Parenthood in Suffolk County saw over 4000 patients about onethird teenagers seeking birth control We believe that the decrease in the pregnancy rate and the abortion rate and the increase in contraceptive patients are the results of our extensive educationoutreach work In 1980 7000 young people participated in various patient and community workshops in schools youth agencies churches and synagogues in Suffolk County Many young people are sexually active but evidently many are choosing to plan their parenthood None of this is to say that teenage pregnancy is not a problem any longer The fact that over 5000 young women still become pregnant each year on Long Island indicates the need for continued education and prevention services BARBARA STRONGIN Executive Director Planned Parenthood of Suffolk County Huntington

"EMERGING ISSUES: CRIME, ENERGY AND POLISH DEBTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/16/us/emerging-issues-crime-energy-and-polish-debts.html,A few issues generally dominate the agenda on Capitol Hill gathering like leafy trees the sunlight of publicity and stunting other matters struggling to receive a public hearing Overshadowing everything else at the moment are the budget taxes and El Salvador But a few saplings are striving for attention and in the next several months three of these growth issues could emerge as important topics of concern  crime energy prices and Polish debts Crime is the issue especially in New York said Representative Geraldine A Ferraro Democrat of Queens It is not unusual for urban lawmakers to hear about crime from their constituents but the issue is clearly spreading In New Hampshire according to Senator Warren B Rudman his people worry about burglaries not street crime but the fears are just as real In southern Florida the influx of drugs and refugees from the Caribbean has led to calls for tighter immigration laws as well as better law enforcement Crime is the hidden social issue of the 80s  not abortion or busing said Representative Charles E Schumer Democrat of Brooklyn Ten years ago crime was a Brooklyn issue Five years ago it was a metropolitan New York issue Now its a national issue This concern has caused a change in the political climate A decade ago many liberals saw law and order as a code phrase for racism and a threat to civil liberties They shunned the issue But now Senator Edward M Kennedys office distributes a pamphlet entitled Violent Crime Its Time To Act This is a challenge to the Democratic Party said Mr Schumer a 31yearold freshman Congressman with a Harvard law degree One reason so many blue collar and middle class voters went for Reagan is that we had no effective answer to the crime issue The Republicans dont either but they talk tough There is a lot of tough talk on Capitol Hill these days but translating fear of crime into practical legislation is very difficult Most criminal issues fall under local jurisdictions and even at the national level a consensus has yet to develop Liberals tend to see the issue as a money problem in Mr Schumers words and suggest spending more on prisons courts police training and the like But in a time of tight budgets this is hardly a popular viewpoint The conservative answer leans toward harsher penalties and tighter legal procedures that embody the philosophy expressed by Senator Strom Thurmond the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Weve got to get tough with these people said the South Carolina Republican Senator Thurmond hopes the Senate will soon consider bills imposing the death penalty for certain Federal crimes along with those that would revise the criminal code Other bills inching through the legislative pipeline would make it easier to introduce illegallyseized evidence at criminal trials and to hold suspects in preventive detention while they wait for trial But for all the fears about crime Mr Schumer says the issue lacks the sort of organized constituency needed to force the issue through Congress Nobody he said except the average citizen comes into my office to talk about crime A year ago the NortheastMidwest Congressional Coalition put out a statement that said A rift between energy winners and losers is dividing America a rift between the 12 states whose abundant energy resources assure them of continued wealth and economic expansion and the rest of the country If anything the rift has grown wider since In a recent report the coalition referred to the energyproducing states as The United American Emirates In the Southwest bumper stickers exhort motorists to drive faster and freeze a Yankee Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas says that the enormous profits from severance taxes flowing into a few states are going to create something closely akin to an energy war As an example Frost Belt Republicans have been virtually unanimous in rejecting White House proposals to reduce research into alternative sources of energy such as solar power The only way the Northeast can get by said Senator Rudman a New Hampshire Republican is to use less fuel and use it more efficiently We have to find alternative sources of energy and the Administration is dead wrong on this one Frost Belt lawmakers are even more incensed by the Presidents proposal to return more programs to the state level There are budget surpluses in the producing states groused Representative Dennis E Eckart Democrat of Ohio while Ohio Pennsylvania and New York face deficits And now we have the new federalism forced down our throats The enmity is even greater because the Sun Belters feel that they have an old score to settle The North held the whip hand for so long and you cant wipe out the memories said Senator Lloyd Bentsen Democrat of Texas Foreign affairs do not intrude on Congressional business very often but the issue of the Polish debts has crystalized a mood that President Reagan used adroitly during his campaign the desire to get tough with the Russians The dispute began when Poland failed to pay about 71 million owed American banks that had been guaranteed by a Government agency The Reagan Administration decided to pay off the loans without forcing Poland to declare default on the ground that such a default would cause panic in the international banking community But the Administration found itself victimized by its own campaign promises People have heard so much of the Administrations antiCommunist antiSoviet rhetoric that they saw this as a chance to put it on the line said Representative Eckart Democrat of Ohio And now the Administration is backing away Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York spoke for a number of his colleagues recently when he said I have been profoundly disappointed by the failure of the United States Government to put in place a coherent and effective response to the suspension of civil liberties and human rights in Poland The Administration survived several test votes on this issue last month but Senator Robert W Kastenmeier Republican of Wisconsin vows to bring it up again This issue wont go away he said

HOSPITALS TURN TO PHILOSOPHERS ON LIFE ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/nyregion/hospitals-turn-to-philosophers-on-life-issues.html,Several New York teaching hospitals are using philosophers in their daytoday operations to help their medical staffs make better decisions affecting the life and death of patients John D Arras a philosopher recently appointed to the clinical staff of Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center in the North Bronx said the intent was to have philosophers help physicians make judgments about life and death with a deeper insight into the meaning of life and into the complex and conflicting moral and ethical questions that are involved In some instances they give advice on specific cases and in other instances they are consulted by physicians on general problems they confront in their practices Typically the philosphers are called into a case by medical staff members who are confused or troubled and they give advice based on ethical literature and legal precedents They do not go along on medical rounds and they rarely talk to patients or their families Often they pose questions to the doctors rather than provide answers The philosophers for example give advice on when or whether a terminally ill patient or a deformed or braindamaged infant should be allowed to die or who should be admitted to an overcrowded intensive care unit or under what circumstances a patient can refuse exotic lifesupport technology But the philosophers only offer advice and never make any actual decisions We do not tell doctors what to do Mr Arras said Jay Kantor a 41yearold philosopher who conducts ethics conferences for medical students and physicians at Methodist Hospital Downstate Medical Center and Brookdale Hospital Medical Center all in Brooklyn says The time is ripe for us Hospitals and physicians have become acutely aware of the ethical issues involved in medical care and they are hopeful that philosophers like myself can help them find better solutions For example determining the mental competency of a person to stand trial for a crime is a psychiatric discipline However mental competency is an extremely difficult and troublesome issue for most psychiatrists and Mr Kantor who is also a philosopher in residence in the forensic psychiatry service at Bellevue Hospital Center helps them define the issue more clearly While many medical schools in the country use philosophers to give students a grounding in medical ethics as part of their academic training Montefiore believes that the idea of having philosophers actually become an integral part of a hospitals clinical staff and thus become personally involved in the daytoday medical decisions involving patients is highly unusual According to Montefiore officials a few medical centers  such as the University of California at Los Angeles the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the University of Texas at Galveston use philosophers on a consulating basis However the officials think that Mr Arras a member of its department of social medicine since last year is the only philosopher in the country with a fulltime appointment to a hospitals clinical staff Like Mr Arras and Mr Kantor the other philosophers working in New York hospitals have received doctorates in philosophy All of them have taught in academic settings The idea for the hospital programs grew out of a pilot project at Montefiore and New York University Medical Center that began five years ago At its inception the program was experimental It evolved gradually moving from advice to medical students into clinical settings in hospitals and it was not until last year that one of the philosophers Mr Arras received a fulltime hospital appointment Stretching Vision This is particularly valuable for young doctors said Dr Carl Eisdorfer Montefiores president We see philosophys wisdom as stretching peoples vision in managing human lives The project was initially financed by the New York Council for the Humanities in cooperation with the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs Both are private organizations that sponsor research programs in philosophy and the humanities Michael Buckner a philosopher at the NYU School of Medicine is the acting head of the schools department of urban affairs and community medicine which along with its philosophymedicine program is to be eliminated in June as a result of cuts in Federal and state aid to medical education Mr Buckner and Natalie Abrams a philosopher who is also on the medical schools faculty have spent five years teaching ethics to students and helping physicians and nurses at the New York University Medical Center and at Bellevue sort out the often conflicting ethical legal and moral issues that can confound the keenest medical minds For example does a living fetus that has been aborted have a right to survive even though the abortion was clearly intended to destroy it Should a hospital permit surgery so that a severely deformed infant can survive an otherwise fatal intestinal obstruction Should a hospital authorize kidney dialysis for an elderly patient who is near death Crises and Questions In most hospitals such decisions are usually made by committees of physicians often influenced by the wishes of the patient and his family While most cases are decided purely by medical factors some are undone by the crisis of the moment such as a cardiac arrest or become hopelessly complicated by profound ethical questions that trouble the collective consciences of hospitals and the physicians who are required to make them Dr Eisdorfer of Montefiore said in an interview that one of the longest and most powerful traditions in medicine the physicians determination to keep a patient alive at all cost  was changing under pressure from patients and their families He said this change was creating enormous conflicts for hospitals and the lawyers they retain to protect them from law suits According to Dr Eisdorfer philosophers like Mr Arras can help resolve ethical conflicts such as when should a physician or a hospital stop attempting to effect a cure and begin helping a patient to die as peacefully as possible Dr Eisdorfer who is a psychiatrist said that while psychiatrists and psychologists in hospitals were involved in dealing with complex moral and ethical issues we also employ philosophers to go beyond these professional disciplines to broaden our approach and understanding No Code Patients In an interview Mr Arras  who is 37 and on leave from his position as chairman of the department of philosophy at the University of Redlands in California  and Nancy Dubler a Harvardtrained lawyer and an expert on the law dealing with medicine and patients rights said that in most hospitals the issue of whether heroic and extraordinary means should be used to save a patient is skirted by unoffically designating such patients as no code In other words Mr Arras said it is just understood that nothing will be done for them if they go into cardiac or respiratory arrest Some states such as Massachusetts have approved legislation authorizing no code hospital protocols Mrs Dubler said but New York has not so hospitals here that use no code designations do so at their legal peril Accordingly some physicians have traditionally perceived the law with suspicion and animosity Mrs Dubler said But she said she hoped to convince doctors that the law could be used as a solid foundation for decent humane medicine Last month Mrs Dubler and Mr Arras were called into a case involving a 15yearold girl who had tried to kill herself by jumping from a building in the South Bronx She did not die but became totally paralyzed and will be so for the rest of her life A Change of Mind By means of blinking her eyes she communicated to members of the medical staff that she still wanted to die The staff members then asked Mr Arras and Mrs Dubler for their advice on what to do if the girl went into respiratory arrest  should they put her on a respirator or allow her to die as she wished The conflict for the staff was resolved when the girl changed her mind and signaled that she wanted to live But the issue still haunts physicians Dr Victor Sidel the chairman of Montefiores department of social medicine said the question of suicide was a major issue for hospitals Physicians are pledged to protect life but there is a conflict when a patient wants to end his There is no use sweeping the conflict under the rug Dr Sidel said he saw philosophers as clarifying assumptions that physicians like myself make and sharpening the conflicts that divide us while raising our collective consciousness At Bellevue Mr Buckner who is 35 recalled a case that troubled medical students and residents and in which he was called in to give advice It was classic  a middleaged alcoholic who was dying from a destroyed liver and heart disease he said Some of the students took the critical view that the patient had destroyed herself and thus did not deserve any extraordinary means to help save her Others felt it was more merciful to allow her to die if she went into cardiac arrest  in other words be treated as a no code patient Then the issue became more complicated A shortage of whole blood developed and this patient was using up a lot of it and the staff questioned whether she should be allowed to get it given her condition her circumstances and the fact that perhaps more deserving patients should get it first But the conclusion he said was that she was given a remote chance of surviving and she did not become a no code patient
THE PARADOXICAL PAPANDREOU,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/magazine/the-paradoxical-papandreou.html,Nicholas Gage a former New York Times correspondent returned recently from Greece where he headed The Timess Athens bureau in l97780By Nicholas Gage Greece has always been a land of charismatic leaders It is almost as though the country is fated to reenact the political dramas of its early history when democracy was created in the Greek citystates The centuries have produced many men who captured the popular imagination with their oratory and their visions of a brighter future Some like Aristides lifted up the country by brilliant statesmanship others like Alcibiades led it into great misfortunes Few in modern times have come to power amid such high expectations and such dark distrust  as Greeces new Socialist Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou A tall husky 63yearold who won a stunning election victory last October on a promise of sweeping change including radical measures that could take Greece out of the Western alliance Papandreou is a man of profound paradoxes His campaign included some of the harshest antiAmerican rhetoric heard in Greece in recent years yet he is a former United States citizen with academic roots in American universities and an American wife Some who know him say he is a dedicated social democrat others fear he is capable of dismantling his countrys democratic institutions in order to perpetuate his rule Melina Mercouri the actress and the new Minister of Culture and Sciences calls him one of the most courageous and committed politicians I have ever met Demosthenes Botsaris a former political ally says Andreas is an actor who does not believe in anything He loves himself power and women and thats all Vasilis Vasilikos the author of Z the book from which the political movie thriller was made and deputy director of the Government television network calls him a total pragmatist His political opponents led by opposition leader Evangelos Averoff accuse him of being a political opportunist who shifted positions throughout his career In person Papandreou seems more the genial professor than the iconoclastic firebrand He listens with gratifying attention to the opinions of his visitors fumbling with his pipe asking incisive questions and expressing his own views with reassuring temperance He smiles easily projecting a charm that never fails to impress those who meet him regardless of their political beliefs But on the balcony the primary soapbox of Greek politicians his manner and his speech are transformed He plants his feet in the stance of a prizefighter and slices the air with his hands his heavy eyebrows drawing together his voice mocking and indignant in turn His rhetoric loses the careful moderation of his private conversations and crystallizes into slogans that touch Greek passions and are scrawled on walls all over the country Greece for Greeks Out of NATO Change At two recent interviews in the Prime Ministers office and at his home in Kastri a suburb of Athens as well as in several previous talks Papandreou spoke of his life and his political plans Im committed to certain values he said I have a vision of what Greece could be which is quite different from what it is The country he heads occupies a critical position at the crossroads of Europe Asia and the Middle East What is his vision what does it portend for the Western alliance and what kind of a political animal is the new Prime Minister of Greece Andreas Papandreou was born on Feb 5 1919 the only child of Sophia and George Papandreou then prefect of the island of Chios Five years later his parents were divorced and the child was placed in the custody of his mother Perhaps because of these family complications Andreas by his own admission grew up a difficult boy His low grades in grammar school led to a confrontation with his father by then the Greek Minister of Education Seeing his fathers disappointment he resolved to win his respect and within a year he was at the head of his class where he stayed from then on Andreas lived with his mother whom he adored in the Athens suburb of Psychiko which was then becoming popular with wealthy families and attracting American British and other foreign residents The style of life of the foreigners and their attitude toward the Greeks of the period whom they viewed as coarse natives developed a great hostility in me Out of this experience came the motto of our movement Greece for the Greeks It is a slogan that has its source in my youth By the time Andreas was 18 and entering the Athens University Law School Greece had fallen under the dictatorship of Gen Ioannis Metaxas George Papandreou was exiled along with other liberals to the island of Andros Andreas became one of the leaders of a Trotskyist group that published an underground journal attacking the dictatorship The Trotskyists he remembers commanded considerable support among Greek youth in those days because they took a strong stand against the dictatorship but were less authoritarian than the Greek Communist Party The security police were aware of his involvement Every time he applied for a pass to visit his father the Minister of Public Order Kostas Maniadakis would taunt the tall darkhaired law student We know all about you Your time is coming In the summer of 1939 Andreas was arrested and subjected to torture by Maniadakiss men who broke his jaw They put eight men on me and the beating lasted 48 hours I didnt break But they knew how close I was to my mother and when they brought her in and I saw her pain at finding me in that condition then I broke He signed a statement repenting of his Trotskyist role and naming some of the other members of the group and was released A strange thing happened 13 years later when I came back to Greece with my wife for the first time I was here in Kastri visiting my father when the phone rang It was the man who had metortured Maniadakis who was by then a Member of Parliament He said Andreas I hear youve become a famous professor a big man in America I hope youre grateful to me If I hadnt chased you out of Greece youd never have gone to America  The call he confesses left him shaken The next morning he sat down to a breakfast of scrambled eggs and as I took my first bite my jaw broke again in the same spot Maniadakiss men had broken it so long ago The fact that Andreas signed the 1939 statement of repentance remains a stain on his record in the eyes of the Greek left  although among the thousands of leftists arrested and tortured during the Metaxas dictatorship many others broke too Andreas himself felt discredited among his friends after his release He was also under continued scrutiny by the security police The upshot was that he decided at the age of 21 to leave for America He visited his father for the last time to ask for his blessing George Papandreou gave it reluctantly and with the warning that he was not in a position to help him financially in the United States Andreas sailed from Piraeus and arrived in New York in May 1940 with 14 in his pockets much of which he squandered at an expensive barber shop having no idea of American prices Although he managed to enroll at Columbia University working in a library on campus to support himself his letters home were filled with loneliness and disappointment For the first time he was completely alone living austerely without his doting mother to look after him or the recognition that his familys name had evoked in Greece His loneliness decreased when he met a young GreekAmerican woman Christine Rassias they were married in 1941 By that time he had transferred to Harvard deciding to take his doctorate in economics  about which he says he knew practically nothing His wife took a job with a Harvard professor he washed windows In 1943 having earned his doctorate he volunteered for the Navy serving mostly as a clerk in Bethesda Naval Hospital He became an American citizen in 1944 As soon as World War II ended Papandreou had his mother join him in Boston they remained inseperable until her death in 1981 at the age of 93 In 1946 discharged from the Navy he returned briefly to Harvard as a lecturer in economics then went to the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor He proved a good teacher colleagues recall that his course comparing Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes was the most popular in the economics department Christine who had entered medical school stayed behind in Boston to pursue her studies After a stint at Northwestern University and an associate professorship at Minnesota he became full professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1955 and shortly afterward chairman of its economics department His ascent was helped by his authorship of several books mostly in collaboration with other professors and by his popularity with students While at Minnesota in 1948 he made the acquaintance of a tall blonde from Elmhurst Ill Margaret Chant She was 25 at the time and they met in a dentists waiting room We went from the dentists office to have a drink she recounts and within an hour I was very impressed with his mind and what strikes everyone about Andreas his immense charm By the end of the evening I was in love with him Their romance was handicapped by Papandreous longdistance marriage Margaret married another man but divorced him after six months Papandreou asked Christine for a divorce and she agreed Now remarried and a psychiatrist in Denver she does not remember her first husband fondly Hes an unpredictable very irresponsible man ruthlessly ambitious she says Andreas has to be Prime Minister of the world to be happy But he has always had very generous feelings toward the Greek people After his divorce Papandreou and Margaret were married in a Nevada civil ceremony in 1951 when he moved back to Greece in 1959 they were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony They have four children all in their 20s The oldest George Jeffrey 29 is a member of the Greek Parliament By the time he met Margaret Papandreous Trotskyist views had moderated and he had begun to take an interest in American politics supporting Henry Wallace for President in 1948 and assuming an active role in Adlai Stevensons 1952 campaign His feelings about the United States were mixed  as they are to this day He says he admires the American dedication to achievement and the respect shown by Americans for individual freedom but regards the system as structured to serve the countrys powerful financial interests Papandreous first trip back to Greece was made in 1953 His father who had been the countrys first postwar Prime Minister and who now headed one of the opposition parties tried to persuade him to stay and resume his Greek citizenship But he refused alienated by the rigid political atmosphere that had developed in the wake of the 194449 Greek civil war in which Communist insurgents had tried to seize power In 1959 he made another trip to his homeland and his father renewed the pressure on him to stay His wife who was very impressed by the elder Papandreou added her encouragement and he finally agreed accepting an offer from Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis that he form a center for economic research in Athens In 1963 the Democratic Center Union of George Papandreou narrowly defeated the ruling National Radical Union lacking a working majority in Parliament it called new elections for the following February By this time the younger Papandreou had left the research center to become an adviser to his father On Jan 2 1964 he went to the United States Embassy and gave up his American citizenship in order to run for the Greek Parliament from his fathers home district of Patras He won decisively and his father named him as his chief aide Andreas Papandreou immediately received strong backing from the left wing of his fathers party Responding he launched violent attacks on the Royal Palace and the armed forces  and on the United States which he accused of interfering in the countrys internal affairs His youthful distaste for arrogant foreigners was revived while dealing with American diplomats as Alternate Minister of Coordination in his fathers Government I wasnt about to let them tell me what to do or to tolerate their interference in our affairs  I wouldnt accept it not out of personal pride but out of national pride His attacks brought him into conflict with his father who feared that his statements would be used by the Communists to sow discontent in the country Although George Papandreou favored liberalization he was deeply suspicious of the Communists who had called for his execution during the civil war Andreas saw things differently from his father because he had not personally experienced the civil war says his wife Margaret who often acted as mediator between the two men Moreover by attacking the Americans the military and the palace the son angered the very powers that could bring the father down In fact King Constantine toppled the new Government after only 17 months with the help of defectors from George Papandreous party who were angry with his son The ensuing political instability triggered the colonels coup of April 27 1967 The colonels arrested 6000 political prisoners including the two Papandreous The younger man was kept in solitary confinement for eight months allowed to exercise only in a specially built cage He considers this period the most painful in his life Isolation he says has a devastating impact on a person You think your value system is your own but to a large extent its social reinforced reconfirmed every day in the contact you have with people What happens when you dont have a chance to test your thinking and your values is that they become corroded and you question everything you believe in Pressure from his influential friends in the United States including the economist John Kenneth Galbraith persuaded the colonels to release him and he left Greece with his wife and their four children Settling first in Sweden and then in Canada he formed the Panhellenic Liberation Movement a coalition of Greek groups opposed to the junta He also launched a campaign of attacks against the junta and against the United States charging that it was American support that kept the colonels in power George Papandreou  the father Andreas had both revered and resented emulated and rebelled against  died in 1968 Six years later the colonels fell Some 100 former Center Union deputies asked the son to take over his fathers party He refused Instead he used his group as the core for the formation of a new party the Panhellenic Socialist Movement which became known by the acronym Pasok From the day he created Pasok says Melina Mercouri he stopped being Andreas Papandreou and became simply Andreas He was now completely his own man In the first postjunta election in 1975 his party finished third with 14 percent of the vote  behind his fathers Democratic Center Union which got 20 percent and Caramanliss new grouping New Democracy which got 54 percent For Pasok however this was the starting point for steady and impressive growth Its successes may be explained partly by its thorough Americanstyle organization in the countryside but even more by its leaders charisma and his political platform which called for greater independence from Greeces allies and for extensive social and economic reforms In the next election in 1977 Pasok took 25 percent of the vote while the Democratic Center Union was reduced to 12 percent disintegrating soon afterward into several factions and New Democracy slipped to 42 percent The turning point in Pasoks fortunes came in May 1980 when Caramanlis was elected by Parliament to the nonpartisan post of President and the leadership of his party was won by a colorless politician George Rallis The moment Caramanlis moved to the Presidency says Vasilikos the Government television executive there was a vacuum in the countrys political life that only Andreas could fill Greek voters had grown tired of the stagnation of Greek politics since World War II with the same faces replacing each other in power They were eager for change  almost any kind of change  and in the 1981 election they gave Pasok 48 percent of the vote That translated into 172 seats in the 300member Parliament an absolute majority Of the remaining seats 115 went to New Democracy and 13 went to the Communists In the past five months Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has been providing Greece with the beginnings of change He has raised the minimum wage increased salaries and pensions for workers in the public sector and purged Government agencies at the executive level He has drafted legislation to lower the voting age to 18 abolish capital punishment improve prison conditions legalize abortion and establish civil marriage But the countrys most difficult problems remain to be dealt with Although Greece has made impressive economic gains in the last 20 years with per capita income adjusted for inflation rising fourfold since 1965 its institutions have not kept pace with its growth Publichealth services are the worst in Europe education is almost as disorganized as Italys and public administration is bloated and inefficient Onethird of the countrys 96 million people are crowded into Athens suffocating the capital and leaving the countryside underpopulated and underdeveloped Inflation at 25 percent is the highest in Western Europe and productivity the lowest To reverse the tide will require tough economic measures Papandreou has hardly prepared the Greek people for the sacrifices entailed On the contrary his hefty salary and pension increases are inflationary He promises to counteract that by freezing or reducing all public expenditures except those for health and education But he promises to improve public services as well  and how he will be able to do that while reducing the budget is a question raised by supporters and critics alike Papandreou proposes to turn the trick by drastic decentralization measures that would see many of the powers and funds of the ministries in Athens turned over to regional and local administrations The efficacy of these plans remains to be proven On foreign issues Papandreou is on equally unsure ground In his election campaign he called for a nationally proud and independent policy So far his implementation of that promise has consisted of several moves that deliberately dramatize his differences with the other members of the Western alliance He has opened a Greek Embassy in Cuba He has restored and broadened a lapsed arrangement initiated by the previous Government to repair Soviet Naval supply vessels in Greek shipyards He has refused to join in NATOs threats of economic retaliation against the Soviet role in the crackdown in Poland In one of his most controversial actions he has granted diplomatic recognition to the Palestinian Liberation Organization and has given its leader Yasir Arafat a lavish welcome in Athens The PLO card in the opinion of a senior American diplomat in Athens was played not only as a show of independence from the United States but in the hope of attracting Arab investments and deposits in Greece Papandreou admits he would welcome Arab capital but insists that his recognition of the PLO was motivated solely by the belief that there can be no peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinians succeed in having a country of their own These actions have strained Greeces relations with its Western allies But on issues of crucial importance to NATO such as Spains admission into the alliance he has been accommodating In the scoffing comment of Constantine Mitsotakis Foreign Minister in the previous Government Papandreou is occasionally compelled to play the lion to give the impression of fulfilling his previous foreignpolicy threats but in effect he changes nothing Papandreou is undeniably in a tough spot If he delivers on his campaign pledges to expel American bases from Greece and pull out of NATO Washington would have to strengthen Turkey as the only NATO member left in the Eastern Mediterranean and that would make Greece even more vulnerable to attack by its historic Turkish antagonist But after all his past rhetoric against NATO and the United States he cannot stay in the alliance and allow the bases to remain and retain his political credibility not unless he gets something in return What he wants is a guarantee against Turkish attack and a resolution of the Cyprus problem The guarantee he explains can take the form either of a NATO commitment to prevent Turkish attack or arrangements to provide Greece with modern arms on the same generous terms as Turkey with the aim of preventing the military balance from tipping in Turkeys favor The stubborn Cyprus issue he says can be solved with the help of American statesmanship That brings in the inescapable American connection There is today a profound contradiction in the Greek view of the United States The prevailing attitude has long been one of fascination with all things American nearly every Greek can boast of a relative who has gone to America and made his fortune That makes the perception of American betrayal all the more bitter  for the Greeks remain convinced that Washington knew in advance of the l974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and encouraged the Turks in their military stroke The result is a general antiAmericanism This popular sentiment must enter into Papandreous thinking Even if his pragmatic side prevails and he decides to normalize his relations with Washington and NATO he can hardly justify maintaining strong ties with either so long as Turkish troops remain in Cyprus A resolution of that problem is thus fundamental to his foreignpolicy calculations The best solution in his view would be the withdrawal of both the 20000 Turkish troops and the 1100man Greek contingent that are stationed in Cyprus and their replacement by a meaningful United Nations peacekeeping force Only after that he feels can the many questions that divide the islands Greek and Turkish ethnic communities be successfully tackled Essential to this plan would be Washingtons willingness to help persuade Turkey to negotiate Papandreous chances of mastering these complex domestic and foreign problems depend to a large extent on his partys continued support Pasok is made up of several disparate groups One faction which includes the Foreign Minister Ioannis Haralambopoulos is totally loyal ready to follow wherever Papandreou leads Other factions such as the old centrists who had been associated with his father or groups close to the publishing magnate Christos Lambrakis and the popular Labor Minister Apostolos Kaklamanis can be counted on to support moves toward a better understanding with NATO and the United States But the strongest faction of all is made up of the hardline Marxists who hold some key party posts and head the Ministries of Public Works Interior and Education While not regarding the Eastern European countries as models this group wants Greece to cut all ties to the West and some of its leaders favor a oneparty Socialist state Papandreou says he is not disturbed by this diversity it may be significant however that his first move in office was to grant recognition to the Communistled resistance of World War II and to stop commemorating the Communist defeat in the civil war As to his own present political outlook Papandreou describes himself as a nondogmatic Marxist  one who subscribes to the Marxist view of history as class struggle but does not admire the political systems it has so far produced I dont believe socialism must be forcibly applied from above he says That requires the dictatorship of the party and inhibits freedom In fact as he describes it his brand of socialism doesnt differ greatly from that of Francois Mitterrand of France or Helmut Schmidt of West Germany I believe he says in a mixed economy as long as it is compatible with personal liberty He has not initiated any sweeping nationalization instead he has promised new incentives to greater investment by Greek industry which nonetheless remains deeply skeptical of his intentions Where he appears to differ from the Western European Socialists is in his view of the EastWest struggle He is less worried than they about the Soviet threat and more concerned about American economic expansionism But neither Papandreou nor his advisers ignore the potential domestic Communist threat to his Government The danger for us is from the Communists not the right because the right is not organized to give us trouble in the streets and the Communists are says Antonis Stratis the Prime Ministers adviser on political affairs They fear us and dont want us to succeed because if we do they wont be able to increase their strength For the moment Papandreou has the popular following and the party unity to press on with his reformist plans and so far he has moved fast enough to show action but slowly enough not to set off shock waves His ministers will have to give him strong backing for the time being because they rode to victory on his coattails I got 22000 votes and my own doorman doesnt recognize me says Yiorgos Katsifaras the Deputy Minister for Athletics The people didnt vote for me they voted for Andreas But as time passes the ministers will develop their own political identities and particularly in the case of the hardline Marxists  will strive to establish some independence from him His popularity will fade for the Greek people throughout their history have been notoriously inconstant toward their leaders and it will be difficult for Papandreou to deliver on his promises Many in Pasok feel that if Papandreou does not manage to solve the major internal and external problems facing the country the Greeks may become disillusioned and turn to authoritarian solutions The conservatives were in power for a generation and totally lost public confidence says Vasilikos If now we fail to bring about the needed reforms there will be chaos We will become easy prey to a military takeover which will be bloodier than anything this country has ever seen Some leading opposition figures on the other hand feel that if there is a totalitarian threat it comes from the man currently in charge The same fears are expressed by some former friends who have known Papandreou since childhood He is a very volatile person says a former colleague at the University of Minnesota a Greek friend from his youthful days As long as things go well for Andreas he will follow a moderate course but if they start to turn sour and he feels threatened then he will do anything to hold on The man recounted an incident from Papandreous youth that he had heard from friends in common and that had been told to me previously by a participant One day a halfdozen highschool students from prominent Athenian families Andreas among them were at the Psaropoulos restaurant then as now the best seafood place in the Athens area They ordered a tray of fish and when it was brought one fish was much larger than the others Andreas immediately took it for himself the other boys set up a chorus of protests As their objections increased Andreas paused for a moment then spat on the fish All right he said holding out his plate if you want it take it Disgusted everyone declined leaving Andreas to enjoy his meal in peace Now Andreas has his big fish the former colleague said But if he thinks hes going to lose it I wonder will he give it up willingly or will he spit on it
REAGAN'S FIRST FRIEND',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/magazine/reagan-s-first-friend.html,Steven V Roberts is a reporter in The Timess Washington bureau who specializes in covering Congress By Steven V Roberts The scene was familiar The White House driveway Banks of cameras and microphones Three Republican leaders grimfaced emerging from a meeting with the President Shouted questions careful answers And the next day big headlines Congressional leaders tell the President they need running room to revise his budget But there was something unusual about this particular tableau Two of the characters positions entitled them to top billing Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee Senate majority leader and Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois House minority leader But the third man in the frontpage photographs held no official rank above that of junior Senator from Nevada Yet there he was joining the partys top chieftains for a critical meeting with the President And he was the one who made the headlines with his comment about running room The third man was Paul Laxalt and that scene in front of the White House last month illustrates the important and unprecedented role this 59yearold lawmaker has carved out for himself in Ronald Reagans Washington He is the truthteller the man who whispers in the ear of the leader Hey Ron youve messed up this one isnt working Later when asked why he had been at that particular meeting Laxalt replied I went along because I was asked to go by the President What message had he delivered Interest rates are the name of the game The deficits present a huge problem He has to give his whole budget a second look That was not what President Reagan wanted to hear but telling him was Laxalts job This is only a most recent example of Laxalts role as court truthteller Last fall for instance he sensed that the Presidents additional 13 billion in budget cuts directed against cities and states would not win approval from officials at a National League of Cities meeting in Detroit And he said so  to a group of reporters The next day the President read Laxalts statement and irritably told an aide Hey I see that even Paul is critical of us Weve got to look at this again Soon after the President agreed to accept only 4 billion in additional trims Laxalt continues to be the man who delivers the bad news when other messengers might fear to do so Because of my relationship with the President Laxalt explains I can say things in a manner that others cant Lyn Nofziger Assistant to the President for Political Affairs until recently when he left to return to private political consulting in Washington admits that to a certain extent people who are on the Presidents staff are always reluctant to bring him bad news In addition its a little difficult to find out whats going on outside So its very helpful to the President to have someone he trusts someone whos not grinding his own ax Laxalt has been called the Presidents best friend so many times that the phrase is now practically part of his name The two men share a deep trusting friendship that goes back 18 years to when they both campaigned for Barry Goldwater during his Presidential bid The Senator recently told Martin Tolchin of The New York Times Were like brothers  If its one thing the President needs its a good brother The Senators reallife brother John a Washington publicrelations consultant describes the relationship more pungently Pauls been riding shotgun for him for quite a while If Ronald Reagan needs a brother Nancy Reagan needs a brotherinlaw someone to help her coddle and care for her husband and one of Laxalts strongest links to the First Family comes through the Presidents wife In the Senators Capitol Hill office a photograph of him and the President is inscribed A favorite picture of my two favorite fellas Fondly Nancy Nancy came to trust Paul like no one else outside the family notes John Laxalt who worked for the Citizens for the Republic Mr Reagans political vehicle between his 1976 and 1980 campaigns She knew Paul would never turn Ron around Paul was protective of him After the Presidents election Laxalt probably could have had any job in the Administration from White House aide to Cabinet secretary But he sensed from the outset that he would be most valuable as an independent agent outside the power structure and the power plays His personal relationship with the President became the basis for a political role that is both vital and unusual Laxalt himself calls his function rather unique and probably unprecedented in Senate history and it is hard to think of a good parallel He holds no official position in the Senate leadership not even a committee chairmanship He has no power base in a large state or influential interest group He avoids the Senate floor and the television studios Yet the First Friend participates in most important strategy sessions on Capitol Hill and few pictures of Ronald Reagan meeting with a delegation of lawmakers do not include the silvery head and crinkly smile of Nevadas junior Senator From the beginning many Washington experts said that Laxalts role could never work that no one rides shotgun for the President without an official title or position Laxalt was aware of the problem Maybe what haunts me he said a little over a year aso is the admonition Richard Nixon gave me on this role No one he said is more jealous of prerogatives than the Senate and House leadership But the widespread and somewhat surprised judgment on Capitol Hill is that Laxalt has pulled it off and one reason is his personality a warm mixture of soft words and quick smiles pats on the back and looks in the eye Like the Roman god Janus Laxalt looks in two directions at the same time and the budget issue demonstrates that facility As a man of the Senate he tells the President that his colleagues are upset that they have to worry about reelection that the Administrations budget will be very difficult for our candidates to run on next November As a man of the White House he tells the lawmakers that the President believes in his budget that he must stand firmly behind it or risk spreading an infection of doubt that would doom his program If both sides understand each other Laxalt hopes compromise will become possible He plays a very important offstage role says Senator William S Cohen a Maine Republican He helps modulate Administration policy and keeps them in tune with the Senate so they understand when to push and when not to push Most lobbying in Washington actually has little to do with crude arm twisting Usually it is a subtle process of answering questions offering information providing assurances How Laxalt performs this function for the Administration was aptly demonstrated by the Senate vote to sell Awacs airplanes to Saudi Arabia Cohens was a key vote A moderate Republican with a Jewish father and considerable expertise in military matters Cohen believed that the Administration should guarantee the security of Israel if it sold weapons to its enemy He expressed his concerns to James Baker a top Reagan aide but was disturbed by the meeting So he sought out the Presidents friend I said to Paul Laxalt Im not satisfied that they know what Im talking about  Cohen recalls And Paul said Ill see that you have access  Cohen saw the President three times and he eventually voted for the arms deal By mutual effort Laxalt and Howard Baker the Senate majority leader have developed a smooth working partnership Instead of seeing the First Friend as a rival Baker regards him as an ally who strengthens the leaderships hand Many rightwing Republicans scorn Baker for following the moderate heresy and Laxalt serves as a bridge to the partys conservative wing Lately though he has come under fire from the far right A typical broadside comes from John D Lofton Jr editor of The Conservative Digest who says I dont think Paul Laxalt would ever go to Ronald Reagan and press him on conservative issues And thats very very sad because he could be a very important person in helping to hold the Presidents feet to the fire Other archconservatives deride Laxalt for remaining friendly with moderate senators like Lowell Weicker  a Connecticut Republican and old tennisplaying buddy  but in fact the Senator from Nevada is particularly valuable to the White House because his contacts cross ideological as well as party lines To his liberal adversaries however Laxalt remains in the grip of conservative orthodoxy I feel he displays a very dangerous kind of hypocrisy toward certain groups says Mary Gojack the Nevada Democrat whom Laxalt trounced in the 1980 Senate race The elderly is one He meets with them and hes very affable and charming Then he votes against them with amazing regularity When Mr Reagan came to town after the 1980 election however one of the first people he saw was Senator Edward M Kennedy who had set up the meeting through Laxalt Later according to an aide of the Massachusetts Senator Kennedy used the Laxalt connection to send a warning to the White House that Raymond J Donovan its nominee for Secretary of Labor might have embarrassing links to organized crime  connections which despite Donovans eventual confirmation are currently under investigation Kennedy really likes Laxalt says the Kennedy aide They dont agree on very much but Kennedy thinks he is an honorable person Officially Laxalt is just a Republican backbencher but when the score is tied and the clock is running his teammates often throw him the ball for the last shot Often he makes it but not always In December for example a HouseSenate conference struggled to forge a compromise resolution that would set stopgap spending levels for the Federal Government When an agreement was finally reached Laxalt who as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee was part of the conference signed it His signature was a signal to other Republicans he says that the White House approved and even the most conservative lawmakers went along But the President ended up vetoing the bill demonstrating that politics can divide even the closest of friends when their priorities differ As a legislator Laxalt is a man of compromise As an executive Ronald Reagan wanted to make a dramatic gesture a symbolic statement against spending Early in the Reagan Administration Laxalts Senate office looked like an oldfashioned political clubhouse with job seekers lined up in the hallways But those job hunters who came off best were Laxalts own family and friends His daughter Michelle became head of Congressional relations for the Agency for International Development his son John hooked on with the finance arm of the Republican National Committee his adopted daughter Denise landed in the White House speechwriting office At least seven aides and cronies also slid into top slots with the new Administration When asked about this remarkable record Laxalt responded bluntly citing the devout politicians creed If you dont take care of your own who will The Senator was equally frank about taking care of his own during the MX missile controversy President Carter had proposed concealing the precise location of the new missiles by continually moving them around on giant racetracks embedded in the deserts of Nevada and Utah Laxalt and his Republican Utah colleague Senator Jake Garn were fiercely opposed to the plan and when Mr Reagan took office they mounted an intense lobbying campaign that included personal appeals to the President When Mr Reagan finally scrapped the racetrack plan Laxalt insisted that his side had won because we came up with the facts But when asked if their friendship had proved useful he admitted The access was important of course There are those who complain that Laxalt does not take sufficient advantage of his access and his acumen Probably the most common criticism of Laxalt is that he does not quite live up to his potential I just wish hed use all that positive energy and channel it into one area of activity says a friend and tennis partner Theres a lot of talent going wasted Laxalt has never been an active legislator Though pressed by many conservatives to challenge Senator Baker for the majority leadership he declined The fact is that he hates fine details and long hours the staples of a leadership job His attitude is not to be involved says a Senate aide who has observed Laxalt closely for years Hes antsy He comes in to vote and gets the hell off the floor After seven years in the Senate it is hard to find a bill of Laxalts that ever became law His work for the President takes up most of Laxalts time these days but he is pursuing a few select items on his own agenda most of them relating to streamlining the Federal bureaucracy He is the coauthor for instance of a comprehensive bill on regulatory reform whose main purpose is to make sure that new rules justify on a costeffectiveness basis the burdens they impose However in typical fashion Laxalt has taken the hardedged dogma of Reaganism and beveled it down a bit His bill represents a compromise with Senate liberals and its main cosponsor is Senator Patrick J Leahy of Vermont a progressive Democrat The compromise has been so artfully drafted that 81 other Senators have signed up as cosponsors Laxalt is also one of the Senates experts on New Federalism the Reagan effort to return more programs and power to state and local officials He heads a Presidential commission that is studying the issue and serves as an Administration emissary to various meetings and conferences on the subject But here again he rejects rigid ideology He sympathizes with governors who worry that they will be assuming more responsibilities without more resources Laxalt has long been concerned with freeing the Western states from the domination of the Federal Government which owns great chunks of land throughout the region As the son of a shepherd who lived off the land Laxalt is a bornagain devotee of the sagebrush rebellion the Western movement for expanding the development and exploitation of public lands One of his more important contributions to the Reagan Administration was to find a littleknown but likeminded Denver lawyer named James Watt and urge the President to make him Secretary of the Interior Laxalts arrival in Washington seven years ago foreshadowed the rise to power of Western conservatives In analyzing the impact of this new breed he stresses their relations with the press The older conservatives he says had a terrible distrust of the press a real paranoia and felt it was best to stay away from them The new Westerners are accessible to journalists As Laxalt notes were all here in great part because of the media Were all comfortable with it and appreciate its importance Moreover the Western conservatives emerged from a different culture from that of the crusty old Southerners and Middle Westerners who had carried the rightwing banner in the past They too believe fervently in states rights but their battles with Washington center on land and water not on the race issue that pervaded Southern politics While the Middle Westerners might not have had a race problem they often shared with Southerners a moralistic view of the world but outside the Mormon realm of Utah the Western experience has been far different The frontier made possible  and necessary  an individualism other regions only talked about If there is a liveandletlive state in the country its probably here says Laxalt of Nevada How rigidly conservative after all can a Senator who represents Las Vegas be This helps explain Laxalts views on the social issues simmering in the Senate As a member of the Judiciary Committee Laxalt consistently votes in favor of efforts to curb abortion and school busing but he does not take a leading position Four of the Senators seven children are adopted and families facing the problem of unwanted pregnancy went to him for legal advice In addition one of the Senators five daughters has by her own admission borne a child out of wedlock I learned firsthand Laxalt says that abortion is an excruciatingly difficult question on a personal basis As a result he scorns lawmakers such as Jesse Helms who try to enshrine their own views in legislation that would ban virtually all abortions Im not going to sit and moralize and tell other people what they should do Laxalt says Jesse must have had very limited personal experience with abortion Ive had a lot Yet Laxalt enjoys the adulation and support of the organized rightwing movement which cares deeply about abortion and he refuses to make a clean break Lately he has come to favor a bill proposed by Republican Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah which would overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and allow Congress and the states to pass their own guidelines This same sort of waffling has marked Laxalts uncertain sponsorship of the Family Protection Act a hodgepodge of measures directed against birth control unions homosexuals and other betes noires of the right Even his colleagues knew that the legislation was not his style and as he began to speak on the subject one day another Senator sidled up to him on the floor and said I want to see what this divorced Nevada gambler has to say about family protection Laxalt says that he agrees with the basic thrust of the bill  Government policy should promote not erode family life  but he now believes that proposals such as denying Federal funds to advocates of homosexuality are above and beyond the proper scope of legislation And he notes that there is a conflict between conservative rhetoric calling for less government and suggestions that Washington police the nations bedrooms and classrooms to enforce rightwing doctrine Accordingly he let the legislation simmer for two years and then withdrew from its sponsorship There is nothing inconsistent however about Laxalts devotion to his land and his upbringing His parents both natives of the French Basque country met in Nevada and settled in Carson City a village of 3000 people and few paved streets when Paul was growing up Dominique Laxalt roamed the hills with his flock most of the year and that left Paul the oldest of six children with a special role At a very tender age he had a great deal of responsibility thrust on him says John Laxalt He learned to be a peacemaker and he was our conduit to Mom Conduit peacemaker  the same words are used to describe him today Mama Laxalt as she was widely known ran a small boardinghouse and restaurant near the state capitol that become a favorite gathering spot for politicians Paul would wait on tables and listen to the talk a scene his brother Robert described in Sweet Promised Land a book about the Laxalt family Invariably their attention would fix on Paul quietly weighing them as equals even then and one or the other would shake his maned head and waggle his jowls and say That boy will be Governor someday  The Laxalts lived a frontier life scratching out a living out from the mountains and their small business and that experience shaped Pauls outlook I come from a selfhelp family he says simply Thats the essence of my conservatism As the child of immigrants young Paul who did not speak English until he went to school was an outsider and an underdog But Basques maintain a fierce pride in their heritage a pride Robert Laxalt calls their flaming shield His brother Paul refers repeatedly to the familys ethnic heritage always in a warm and loving way Although his brother Robert feels that Paul was cheated of his youth by all his responsibilities the future Senator became a star athlete in high school football basketball even a bit of Golden Gloves boxing But his real love was always tennis and even when the local cowboys called him a sissy for wearing shorts and swatting a little white ball he stayed at it and won the state junior championship Mama Laxalt packed Paul off to Santa Clara a Jesuit college in California Before he could get his degree the military packed him off in 1943 to the South Pacific When he came back Robert wrote he seemed to have lost the decisiveness and confidence that had always been part of his makeup Like a wounded animal he went to the mountains and lived with my father until he was healed again His decisiveness returned after he met Jackie Ross the daughter of a Republican politician who later became a prominent judge After marriage and law school at the University of Denver the newly minted attorney joined his fatherinlaws firm in Carson City and served as Ormsby County District Attorney His first big break came in 1962 just as he was turning 40 Rex Bell a former cowboy movie star was a candidate for Governor and needed a running mate from northern Nevada in the Lieutenant Governors slot Bell looked up his old friend Judge Ross and eventally decided on his soninlaw Before the election however Bell died and Laxalt was urged to run in his place But the Democrats had a popular incumbent and Laxalts welltuned political antennae told him that running for Governor then might snuff out his career at the starting gate So he stayed in the race for the second spot and won handily Old Carson City friends say that the young Paul Laxalt could sometimes be prideful and thinskinned And several reporters recall the time when as Lieutenant Governor he strenuously objected to the construction of a Federal Job Corps camp because it might attract unruly blacks In the view of a veteran Nevada State House reporter Laxalt has broadened considerably since then As Senator he seldom shows the testy side of his nature Laxalt set out on the road to the Senate in 1964 but was waylaid by Nevadas incumbent Democratic Senator Howard Cannon One reason for his defeat was his decision to ignore his advisers warnings and campaign with Barry Goldwater then a doomed candidate for President But Goldwater was a friend and Laxalt takes friendship seriously When Richard Allen was under fire recently and on his way out as national security adviser Laxalt appeared at a luncheon in his honor and shook Allens hand in front of a battery of photographers Laxalt finally won the Nevada governorship in 1966 but his political success led to personal disaster The rugged campaign was a complete grind for the family according to his daughter Michelle now 27 Things got worse when the family moved into the Governors mansion Carson City was a tiny town a goldfish bowl and his teenage children were rebellious and resentful Meanwhile the Governors wife was becoming an alcoholic The family talks openly about her problem now and Jackie Laxalt after seven years of sobriety has recently returned to Nevada to help counsel other alcoholics The town oozed with rumors and Michele remembers her mothers life in those years with considerable pain People would call in the middle of the night and ask her Is it true that you and Paul are getting divorced Is it true hes sleeping with his secretary It was so distasteful to her that she withdrew completely Most analysts in Carson City do not give Laxalt very high marks as Governor and he now admits that he was not temperamentally suited to the pressures and details of the job But he does take pride in one accomplishment rescuing the gambling industry the backbone of the states economy It was during Laxalts tenure that Howard Hughes moved to Las Vegas and started buying up casinos and the Governor became an ardent supporter of the secretive millionaire He treated Hughes as a special case never requiring him to appear publicly before the state agency that grants gaming licenses Laxalt does not apologize for bending the rules for Hughes I was acting in crisis circumstances he explains The Las Vegas economy was crumbling and Hughes confided in me that his physical condition was terrible He looked like a damn cadaver Laxalt has accepted campaign contributions from Las Vegas interests some of whom contribute to both candidates in an election One contributor Morris B Moe Dalitz has often been accused by various criminal investigators of racketeering connections When asked why he has not returned Dalitzs money Laxalt answers Moe Dalitz is a friend of mine Im not going to say to him now Get lost youre too hot I dont play it that way The same year that Paul Laxalt became Governor of Nevada Ronald Reagan became Governor of California The two men knew each other from the Goldwater campaign and now they had to deal regularly on problems relating to Lake Tahoe which spans their common border They soon found they liked each other and the Reagans visited Laxalts retreat at Marlette Lake a remote spot high in the Sierra Nevada where Laxalts father used to run sheep The wooden table at the old sheep camp bears a souvenir of one visit a heart surrounding two sets of initials RR and NR Our greatest bond is love of the outdoors Laxalt says of Mr Reagan We also come from comparable smalltown backgrounds and were both jocks The Nevada Governor was almost 12 years younger than his California counterpart but he was a more seasoned politician Laxalt recalled a year ago that their times together at governors conferences and other political meetings Ron was never quite comfortable with other political figures He relied quite a bit on me to get a reading on the other guys or what the situation was He knew for instance that I got along well with Nelson Rockefeller and I was a bridge there a few times That is the basic Laxalt making contacts reading moods building bridges Above all he is a politician not a legislator or an executive After two years in the Governors mansion Laxalt became disillusioned with the job according to Bill Sinnott his longtime aide and started spending more time on the tennis court and less in the Capitol I decided Id be better off in private life Laxalt later told a reporter My marriage was deteriorating and my family disintegrating When my little ones called me Governor I decided I wanted out So although a second term was virtually assured Laxalt declined to run but his departure from the public eye did not help his marriage and in a year the Laxalts were divorced He did not marry his secretary of many years Carol Wilson until 1976 The Roman Catholic faith in which he was brought up tottered a bit during the course of his divorce and remarriage but it remains a strong element in his identity Professionally his new private life gave Laxalt a chance to fulfill an old dream building a hotel and casino in Carson City called the Ormsby House Laxalt has always displayed an admiration for businessmen and a fascination with wealth During the first year of the Reagan Administration one of his proudest accomplishments was bringing a group of highpowered money managers to the White House to brief the President Later he boasted that the managers controlled about 400 billion in total assets But his high regard for the freeenterprise system did not make him a good businessman and soon the project was in trouble Eventually he and his chief partner his brother Mickey needed more cash and they used connections in Las Vegas to obtain a loan from a Chicago bank while putting up very little collateral Ever since his opponents have tried to use this loan against Laxalt but the tactic has never worked Still the project faltered and before long the brothers sold out And in 1974 when Senator Alan Bible announced his retirement Paul Laxalt jumped into the race It was the year of Watergate and the first BasqueAmerican ever elected to the Senate squeaked in by only 600 votes the only Republican in the country to capture a Senate seat held by a Democrat When Paul Laxalt first arrived in Washington a bit more than seven years ago the Republicans were still reeling from Watergate He became involved with a group of conservative Senators who called themselves the Steering Committee The group offered a congenial base for the newcomer who had never served in a legislative body before Laxalts first opportunity to demonstrate his political skills before a national audience came about by accident As the only member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee to vote against a bill on commonsitus picketing allowing labor unions to close down an entire job site over a single grievance Senate custom called for him to become the floor leader of the opposition During that battle the freshman legislator developed what he now calls the insideoutside strategy using conservative activists and paid advertisements to generate pressure from outside groups that could then be used to influence Washington insiders The Laxalt forces lost the battle on the Senate floor but won the war Adroitly orchestrated public pressure led President Gerald R Ford to veto the bill and his veto was upheld Since then Laxalts insideoutside strategy has been elevated to a high art with thousands of conservative activists and contributors names stashed away on computer tapes ready to be energized at the push of a button Last year President Reagan pushed that button to help generate support for his economic program The ReaganLaxalt friendship which had lapsed somewhat when the Nevadan left state office revived when Laxalt came to Washington Looking around the political landscape the new Senator was not overly impressed with the field of Republican Presidential candidates I didnt find anyone in town who could communicate as well as Ron he recalled soon after the election So the freshman Senator became Ronald Reagans campaign manager in 1976 and traveled to 41 states boosting the Californians bid for the Republican nomination It was a grueling and ultimately fruitless mission but the exposure he received marked the coming of age of Paul Laxalt as a national figure The morning after the 1976 election Laxalt met with Ron and Nancy in Los Angeles We all assumed Carter would have eight years Laxalt says But I suggested that Ron never close the door Things were politically volatile When two years later he whiffed what he said a year ago was a a smell of death about the Carter Presidency it was like a dose of smelling salts for Ronald Reagans Presidential hopes The revived candidate moved around the country making speeches and gathering chits In Washington the Senator served as Mr Reagans John the Baptist as John Laxalt puts it spreading the good news of Ronald Reagans message and guiding him through the strange world of the nations capital Meanwhile back in the Senate Laxalt was thrust into the biggest fight of his career  leading the opposition to the Panama Canal treaties He lost the treaty fight by one vote but in the process gained the respect of his adversaries and the press In 1980 Laxalt had his own reelection campaign to worry about Though he did not hit the trail for Mr Reagan as often as he had in 1976 he remained in constant touch with the candidate Often on Sunday afternoons they would talk for hours on the telephone and during the campaign the charmer from Nevada showed that he could play political hardball with the pros Take the case of John Sears Mr Reagans campaign manager Laxalt deeply disagreed with the Sears strategy of isolating Mr Reagan from the public and the press he also seemed to resent Searss intimacy with the Reagans one of the few relationships that rivaled his own From the outset Laxalt recalls I raised warnings with Ron and Nancy about Sears But until Iowa they were entranced with him After Mr Reagans defeat by George Bush in the Iowa caucuses Laxalt saw his opening He went to New Hampshire the next stop on the primary circuit and intensified his antiSears campaign On primary day Mr Reagan announced that Sears was out Paul Laxalts toughest moment in his relationship with Ronald Reagan came during the Republican nominating convention in Detroit Both men knew that naming Laxalt as the VicePresidential candidate made no political sense another conservative Westerner from a small state would add nothing to the ticket Moreover Laxalt did not want the job at least at first I always felt he says given my penchant for independence and privacy that it would be a bad position for me and for Ron But Mr Reagan refused to take Laxalts name off the list of candidates and Laxalt agreed to keep his name on though he kept himself out of the lastminute deliberations When reporters told him on the convention floor that George Bush had been chosen he was clearly rattled Paul Laxalt takes pride in being an insider but the Reagan forces had not given him the word on Bush and as a result he looked like an outsider Also he looked like a loser He was obviously upset but he also knew that Bush would help the ticket in just those areas where Ronald Reagan was weak Since the election Laxalt and Bush have taken to socializing and to playing tennis together For now they are on the same side of the net politically But that could change if Bush someday becomes the candidate of the moderate wing of the party to succeed President Reagan and Laxalt is handed the standard for the conservative faction Laxalts real test says one knowledgeable Senate aide will come when the Republicans start to fall apart Hes the one guy capable of holding the whole thing together Laxalt tends to agree that things are going to be much more difficult in the year ahead And he says the President cant be on bended knee all the time This conversation took place in a hotel in Reno and Laxalts suite provided a magnificent view of the snowdusted mountains of the Sierra Nevada The Senators gaze kept straying to that view as he talked and at one point he said Its a curious thing when I first went back to Washington I didnt realize in terms of orientation what those mountains do You can look out and immediately know what is north east south and west When I first arrived in Washington if I would lose sight of the monuments I would start to panic Laxalts unconscious metaphor was telling The man had found his bearings in Washington and had helped elect a President Someday he might have to face the choice of running for the Presidency himself but these mountains will always remain the compass in his life
PROBLEMS ARE MOUNTING IN N.C.A.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/sports/problems-are-mounting-in-ncaa.html,Seventeen schools are on the National Collegiate Athletic Associations probation list equalling the highest number for a single period and the list will go higher before it goes lower according to David Berst the director of the associations enforcement department At a time when costs are escalating rapidly in college sports at a time when lucrative television dollars are available for successful football and basketball teams and at a time when increased outside involvement from alumni and boosters have led to excesses and embarrassments in recruiting and in some cases outright scandal educators are being forced to consider whether the athletic system is out of control The violations against the 17 schools range from illegal transportation to illegal entertainment and illegal financial inducements for recruiting prospects The last of these schools St Louis University was cited last Thursday for illegal outofseason basketball practices and covering up such practices A Range of Irregularities In addition other schools are on probation for violations involving forged academic transcripts and unearned credits and administering improper financial aid to athletes The length of probation varies but any such penalty usually prohibits a team from postseason competition and sharing in the sizable television revenue in football and basketball the sanctions can also affect a schools recruiting by placing restrictions on the number of scholarship athletes allowed into the college each year As many as 35 more schools are under investigation by the NCAA for possible violations including Clemson last years undefeated and topranked football team and the University of Southern California a traditional power Already on probation among others besides St Louis are UCLA Oregon Miami Fla Arizona State Wisconsin and Wichita State which has been penalized six times by the NCAA since 1952 and was handed its most recent threeyear penalty for 42 violations in its basketball program There isnt a meeting that goes by without some discussion of the problems in college athletics said Dr Edward J Bloustein the president of Rutgers University who is a member of the board of directors of the American Council on Education and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges Its a little distressing to hear my colleagues say they cant control it and they dont know if they can outvote their coaches with their alumni body Dr Bloustein was referring to matters related to the athletic policy within a university Dr Paul Hardin a former president of Southern Methodist once turned in his school to the NCAA for recruiting violations Im more alarmed now than I was at SMU says Dr Hardin who is president of Drew University in Madison NJ What I dealt with then was relatively trivial except for being corrupt What I hear about now goes more to the heart of the educational enterprise Dr Hardin said he was not referring to abuses at Drew but to those at major schools across the country A Wide Range of Problems Recent developments underscore the complex pressures that differ in size and scope from the problems that haunted the collegiate system in decades past Some of the more dramatic examples are  During a 10day period in January a former tennis coach at Arizona State University Marty Pincus and the head track and field coach at the University of Arizona Willie Williams shot and killed themselves both apparent suicide victims Pressures brought on by the two Arizona schools joining the highly competitive Pacific10 Conference were among the factors cited by family and friends in the deaths of the two coaches  Jackie Sherrill the football coach at the University of Pittsburgh for the last five seasons accepted a sixyear offer of 17 million in money and extra benefits on Jan 19 to become the athletic director and football coach at Texas A  M Several college presidents voiced concern and shock at the size of the financial package considered the largest ever at an American college or university HR Bright chairman of the board of regents for Texas A  M said Higher education is a business and I think Sherrills contract is part of that process  On Feb 5 Rick Kuhn a 26yearold former basketball player at Boston College was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for his part in a pointshaving scheme hatched during the 197879 season In imposing sentence Judge Henry Bramwell of United States District Court in Brooklyn noted that Kuhns crime reminded millions of sports fans that athletes can be compromised Every college athlete may now come under suspicion from coaches and fans  Current and former track and field athletes at the University of Texas at El Paso many of them foreigners say that over the years their former coach Ted Banks had reneged on scholarship promises paid for winning performances and enrolled them in cushion classes to insure passing grades and preserve their eligibility Banks denied the allegations  James Bozeman a 6foot5inch senior starter on the Florida State basketball team said he left the team in December rather than take drugs that he said were pushed at him by the basketball office for a damaged knee and ankle In a subsequent letter to the schools athletic director CW Hootie Ingram Bozeman charged the athletic department with improper medical attention financial exploitation mental harassment and academic and scholastic misrepresentation A fivemember university committee recently completed its findings in the case last Friday Ingram said the committee is in the process of reporting to the athletic board and the board will present it to the president for his consideration The basketball coach at Florida State Joe Williams denied that he forced Bozeman to play when he was injured and denied that the player was forced to use painkilling drugs  Several weeks ago The Los Angeles Times reported that Sam Gilbert a wealthy Encino Calif contractor had assisted UCLA athletes in the purchase of stereos and clothes cosigned a promissory note for a player to buy a car and even arranged abortions for the girl friends of players Lucius Allen a former UCLA player said that Gilbert had paid for an abortion for one of his friends Last Friday Mr Gilbert said Ive never paid for an abortion in my life  Charges of illegal drug usage along with alleged academic and recruiting violations and lesbian relationships between the coach and players engulfed the University of South Carolinas womens basketball team this winter following the resignation of Coach Pam Parsons on Jan 4 Miss Parsons has publicly denied the allegation concerning lesbianism  brought by players and an assistant coach Last Friday Paul Ward general counsel for the university said that the university considered the case closed Jean Toal an attorney for Miss Parsons said Friday that the issue of litigation is still under consideration by Miss Parsons Engulfed by Sports In attempting to assess the influence that sports holds on most major campuses Harold Enarson the former president of Ohio State University wrote recently that no other activity in our universities  not the liberal arts not the science programs and not our libraries commands such deep and widespread public support It is out of control when student athletes are admitted in violation of clearly established rules governing the admission of students Enarson wrote in the JanuaryFebruary issue of The Center Magazine a publication issued by The Robert Maynard Hutchins Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions Dr Enarson was not implicating Ohio State in his article but discussing the wide range of NCAA violations at schools across the country College athletic programs are out of control the article continued when the evaluation of academic transcripts is subverted by anyone  powerful friends of the university coaches university administrators It is out of control when grades for athletes are falsified on a systematic basis  It is out of control when the recruiting of bluechip athletes involves in some systematic fashion the top business political and corporate leadership of the community and the state  It is out of control when decisions of the most farreaching consequence  for example enlarging the football stadium or shifting to a different athletic conference  are made without regard for the usual processes of internal review and consultation pu second ad ncaa Such problems have not been confined to major athletic institutions While serving as basketball coach at New York Tech a Division II school Sam Stern said he regularly lent small sums of money to players during the 197980 team knowing that the practice was a violation of NCAA rules I dont know if theyre concerned with the reality of the situation Stern said discussing NCAA rules Where a guy doesnt have money to eat waiting for a refund check from the college I would hope they would look at the situation realistically Youve got to take a closer look at the rules Stern said Whats good for Division I may not be good for Division II Whats good for Division II may not be good for Division III For Thomas Vines a senior communications major at the University of Maryland Baltimore County the conflict between his academic schedule and basketball practices forced him to drop off the team this year Five days before the start of his final semester Mr Vines said the schools scholarship committee informed him that his scholarship had been revoked because he had dropped off the team All athletic grants are issued on a oneyear renewable basis How in the world does academics hold priority over athletics if the scholarship committee itself which is composed of athletic staff members and professors require me to report for practice knowing my schedule Mr Vines wrote in a letter that was published in the DecemberJanuary issue of the The Black Collegian Magazine And how do academics hold priority over athletics if a studentathlete loses his financial assistance from the university if he decides to intensely pursue his academics On His Own Mr Vines who said he is taking 19 credit hours this semester said he will pay for his tuition books and fees mostly with the aid of a 1500 loan from an acquaintance who heard about his plight When youre being recruited its a whole different world he said Its like window shopping all glamour and bright lights But once you get in and try to buy the merchandise its different You feel powerless to do anything The school has locked up all the angles and theres a noreturn policy on the merchandise Its like the lamb staring the tiger in the face Fear of reprisals  either through loss of job scholarship or favors  has prompted most athletes coaches educators and administrators to accept the status quo In a 1981 survey of 188 male and female athletes at four Connecticut colleges Yale the University of Connecticut Southern Connecticut State and the University of New Haven Dr Allen L Sack a sociologist and the director of the Bronxbased Center for Athletes Rights and Education found these results 63 percent of the women and 49 percent of the men on scholarship said they feared their athletic aid would be withdrawn if they did not perform to a coachs expectation 42 percent of the men on scholarship said they felt pressure to take less demanding academic majors because of their sports involvement and 48 percent of those on scholarship said they were encouraged to take easy courses When athletes not on scholarships were asked similar questions the percentages were significantly lower Dr Sack reported Its not a problem of individual deviants a misguided coach a greedy kid or the badapple theory said Dr Sack a former Notre Dame football player who is completing a pilot study of basketball players at six New York area colleges and hopes to expand the project into a national survey Thats totally wrong This year has shown deepseated problems that are not going to be solved by one or twoyear probations Weve always had abuses but the commercialization has become so rampant and made the stakes so high that its introduced an element of hysteria Search for Identity A frantic search for identity brought the University of New Haven two years of probation in 1980 for illegal basketball tryouts outofseason practices and fifthyear eligibility violations What remains etched in Jeff Fletchers mind as a studentathlete however were the threats of losing his scholarship and the 2 AM practices sometimes during midterm examinations The pressure to perform was always there said the 6foot6inch Fletcher now a graduate student in clinical psychology at New Haven I still wonder why we had those 2 AM practices The only thing I can think of was that the coach was somehow trying to emulate coaches of the past in trying to build some type of discipline But all it led to was resentment If recruiting remains the NCAAs tender Achilles heel the unexpected deaths of Pincus and Williams exposed even more frightening pressure points Both were 41 years old were respected by peers Williams was selected an assistant coach for the 1984 United States Olympic team carried professional commitments into their private lives and became increasingly troubled by the uncertainty within their respective athletic departments At the time of Pincuss dismissal in June 1979 Fred Miller then the Arizona State athletic director said we expect success and on a national level Pincus Achieved Success Pincus had achieved success His teams in his seven seasons as head coach had won 164 matches and lost 31 They had won three Western Athletic Conference championships But Pincus reportedly told Miller he did not think that Arizona State could match some of the tennis powers such as UCLA and USC in the Pacific10 Conference the league Arizona State had joined The night before he died Pincus talked into the earlymorning hours with Paulette Bolyard a close friend according to Miss Bolyard Pincus was frustrated and depressed about the loss of the coaching job Even though the dismissal had come twoandonehalf years earlier Miss Bolyard said the pressures stayed even after Marty was gone  he could never accept the idea that they should have fired him In a personal notebook that he kept to record his daily chores Pincus wrote on Jan 5 the day he died ready willing and able Miss Bolyard who is a freelance writer in Tucson Ariz said she was totally shocked by Williamss death It was like seeing Martys death notice over again she said Marty knew Williams and they shared a lot in their views toward coaching When you watch things happen and you watch assassination attempts its like people pick things up Maybe Willie had pressures like Marty saw what happened to Marty and figured that might solve his problems Willie and Margaret Williams first came to Arizona in 1969 It was fun like an adventure recalled Mrs Williams who has four children Then the fun just vanished In the last five years I watched a calm caring man become an uptight man and not know why Willie was a private man a positive person but there were obviously a lot of negatives that he kept to himself I used to tease Willie said Joe Fineman a close friend and former assistant who is now a stockbroker in San Francisco Id say How come you got those tight jaws Hed say Pressures Fine Pressures  Last August appearing before a group of University of Arizona officials investigating budgetary problems Williams was asked whether he had ever provided financial assistance to any of his athletes by either handling funds or telling them where to go Refuse to Answer I refuse to answer that said Williams who was one of the first black head coaches at a major college Have you given money to any of them or loaned them money Richard Fish a legal adviser to the school persisted in the questioning I refuse to answer that Williams said Margaret Williams says she is really bitter about intercollegiate athletics Its an enormous responsibility she continued You can recruit athletes and take them miles from home When theyre in school you become an extension of their family We felt a responsibility to these young people We tried to make these people part of our family Willie was split into several directions  his own family and his track family He once said track was his mistress but I couldnt complain and nag That was part of what I accepted Sam Gilbert who was considered closer to many UCLA players than John Wooden the legendary Bruin basketball coach admittedly offered various forms of assistance to UCLA athletes I dont think its wrong if a kids in my home and were teaching him to read and hes come there with a 20 average Mr Gilbert said during a recent phone interview from his office We make him sit down and then write what hes read so he knows hes comprehending I dont think thats wrong I think thats right Its morally right Hes away from home hes a kid hes lonely hes misguided and there are people who misguide him We have a former football player from UCLA right now Billy Don Jackson whos spending 10 years in jail because no one played surrogate father to him He got involved with the wrong people had no adult to talk to got involved in the drug scene got kicked off the team never went to class There was a quarrel over some sale of drugs a kid got killed and he was present I oppose that I almost feel guilty because of it Morally Right Mr Gilbert 69 said he has never read the NCAA rule book If its wrong for a kid to come to my home and I help him study and he eats and if thats a violation then I think the rule is wrong he said There was once a kid whose mother died and they didnt have money for either a funeral or for him to go to the funeral I paid for that I think thats morally right It may be against the NCAA rule but I think its morally right What would you do if you knew a kid real well and his mother died and you could afford to send him to the funeral David Berst the NCAA enforcement director said its improper for an outside person or a coach to provide personal expenses for an individual In recent years Rutgers has tried to straddle the scheduling fence between the Ivy League and such major powers as UCLA Alabama Penn State and Pittsburgh With the lure of the dollar and the investment so great Dr Bloustein said assessing current conditions Im now rethinking whether the middle ground can be held Thats my concern he added As TV revenues rise as rewards and costs rise if the cost of coaching is going to take a dramatic upturn as a result of contracts like the one Jackie Sherrill signed a lot of us will have to ask ourselves Can we stay in this thing   Tomorrow Why the rules get broken

POLITICS; PACT ON COURT SEATS TO BE HONORED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/nyregion/politics-pact-on-court-seats-to-be-honored.html,MARTIN MELLMAN the new Nassau County Democratic leader said last week that he would honor a bipartisan deal he inherited despite Governor Careys refusal to abide by it Mr Mellmans predecessor Stanley Harwood now a State Supreme Court judge had agreed with Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau Republican chairman to give bipartisan endorsements for County Court this year to Alan Winick a Democrat and Stuart Ain a Republican As part of the agreement Mr Harwood himself won bipartisan endorsement for the State Supreme Court However Governor Carey put at least a temporary crimp in the deal by appointing for an interim term in the County Court an assistant district attorney Abbey Boklan who heads the major criminal prosecution unit that includes 23 assistant prosecutors in Denis E Dillons office Mrs Boklan 42 years old has the enthusiastic support of the Democratic District Attorney although she is a Republican Democratic and Republican leaders intend to stick to the agreement to nominate Mr Ain and Mr Winick for full terms in the November election I inherited the agreement and Ill honor it unless something happens out of my control Mr Mellman said Robert McDonald a spokesman for Mr Margiotta said that the Republican leader would stick to the agreement despite the Governors action That means that Mrs Boklan would serve only until the end of the year and Republicans might attempt to keep her off the bench altogether by blocking her confirmation in the State Senate Convicted of two misdemeanors in a rare electionlaw case that wound up in a criminal court John T Cain an antiabortion activist is planning to appeal his conviction even before his scheduled sentencing on May 10 in Nassau County Court Mr Cain a New York City public schoolteacher faces up to a year in prison on the two counts  election law misconduct and execution of a punishable falsewitness statement The jury could not agree on a more serious perjury charge a felony that would have automatically cost Mr Cain his job He was indicted for his role in collecting petitions for his own candidacy in a challenge of the renomination of State Senator Ralph J Marino in a 1980 Republican primary Mr Cain was accused of collecting some 30 husbandwife signatures in which a husband or wife also signed for the spouse He was also accused of falsely swearing on the petition that he had witnessed each signature and charged with perjury when he testified in State Supreme Court that he had witnessed all the signatures Mr Cain had sought in Supreme Court to have his candidacy reinstated after his petitions had been invalidated by the Nassau Board of Elections The case with its dramatic consequences focused on the long troublesome issues involving insurgent attempts to get on the ballot in the face of challenges by regular organization politicians and the intricacies of the state election law that often trip up amateur politicians District Attorney Dillons office had offered Mr Cain a single misdemeanor pleabargaining deal but he refused As the trial started two weeks ago County Court Judge Patrick Cunningham offered Mr Cain a similar pleabargaining opportunity and threatened him with jail if he were convicted according to A Lawrence Washburn Mr Cains attorney The defendant again refused and the trial continued The judge a Syracuse resident had been assigned to the case to avoid any local political influence or bias Mr Washburn said he was already pursuing an appeal to the State Court of Appeals with the argument that the indictment was defective If that failed he said he would take the appeal on the basis that the judge improperly barred the testimony of 20 defense witnesses who were prepared to say that they had signed petitions for their spouses on other candidates petitions The judge also refused to allow questions of prosecution witnesses whether they were authorized to sign a spouses signature Mr Washburn said that at one point Judge Cunningham said that he would send to the District Attorney for prosecution any defense witness who admitted that he or she had signed for a spouse on other candidates petitions The defense was trying to make the point that such signatures were not uncommon While Mr Cain faces a possible jail sentence a more politically connected Islip Republican committeeman who pleaded guilty to falsely witnessing petitions suffered only a weeks suspension from his job as deputy environmental commissioner of Islip and a 350 fine in court Harold Ferguson a follower of the powerful Islip Republican leader Anthony Pace pleaded guilty to election misconduct in the bitter primary campaign last year over Mr Paces leadership A twoman committee composed of a rabbi and a lawyer concluded that Mr Fergusons oneweek suspension from his job and the fine were enough punishment Nassau Democrats have designated one of their strongest candidates Barbara Blumberg to attempt to capture the State Senate seat of the late John D Caemmerer in a special election April 20 Mrs Blumberg 54 years old was a North Hempstead council member and one of the few Democrats holding town offices in Nassau County until her defeat last year in a bitter campaign Her Republican opponent in next months special election is Michael J Tully the North Hempstead Supervisor The Nassau Republican organization is probably unique with its legal defense fund which has been used to provide lawyers for Republican politicians including Mr Margiotta in trouble with the law Mr Margiotta was convicted in December of extortion and mail fraud growing out of insurance commission kickbacks At least 400000 has already been spent on Mr Margiottas behalf with 100000 more raised for his appeal at a recent cocktail party Yet there is apparently no requirement that the donors of these funds or the expenditures be reported like campaign finances The result is that the contributors many of them presumably doing business with the county and town are hidden from public view Donald McCarthy counsel for the State Board of Elections said that no reporting was necessary if the funds were not used to support a party or a candidate Speaking of campaign funds a group of eight major Nassau Republicans including Mr Margiotta County Executive Francis T Purcell and the thenHempstead Presiding Supervisor Alfonse M DAmato guaranteed more than 150000 in bank loans to Perry B Duryeas unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign four years ago with each one guaranteeing 19375 The Duryea campaign deeply in debt was unable to pay off the loans but the local Republicans have been financially rescued by the

LEGISLATURE HAS WAYS TO GET ITS WAY ON BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/27/nyregion/legislature-has-ways-to-get-its-way-on-budget.html,While Governor Carey and the legislative leaders haggle over billions of dollars in state spending the Legislature and its staff are making scores of small spending decisions Those decisions could have a major effect on the future of state programs and on the way those programs affect communities across the state They demonstrate how control over the public purse gives the Legislature enormous influence not only over broad policy direction but also on the most basic decisions that the states agencies make Sometimes for example the Legislature will cut funds as a warning to a commissioner or to curtail the ability of an agency to pursue policies the Legislature does not like Thus the State Consumer Protection Board is listed for cuts of 10000 for consumer advocacy and 50000 for utility intervention which involves utility companies and rate cases Directors Role Cited Sources in the Legislature said that some Republican Senators were unhappy at the highly visible role that the executive director of the board Karen S Burstein has played in the effort to stop construction of the NineMile Point 2 nuclear plant upstate Board officials say the cut will severely curtail the boards ability to become involved in utility cases Theyre taking away our computer said one official who asked not to be named Republican budget officials in the Senate say they are not trying to cripple the agencys efforts in this area But Assembly Democrats are insisting that the money be restored Were not going to print the budget until that goes back in said David Langdon a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Legislators Fight Phoenix House Then there is the case of Phoenix House a drugtreatment program that is trying to build a center in Westchester County Several Senators from Westchester would prefer that the New York Citybased program stay out of the county and hope to arrange that by cutting financing for the center The budget process also provides opportunities to debate some of the most divisive of political issues For several years for example adoption of the state budget was held up for several days beyond the April 1 deadline by disputes over whether the state should finance abortions for poor women through the Medicaid program The Senate has in the past voted to cut the funds but the Assembly has refused to do so While such an issue can be raised through many channels in the Legislature opponents of abortion believed that the threat of holding up the budget gave them extra leverage over the Assembly leadership Often said C Mark Lawton Mr Careys budget director the Legislature can make its will felt not by cutting money but by making appropriations exceedingly specific We may ask for a general appropriation in a given area and theyll break it out into specific pieces to make sure we spend the money on certain things Mr Lawton said Banking Board a Target In addition he said that some regulatory agencies such as the Banking Board may find their ability to enforce certain regulations curtailed by budget cuts The Legislature is also seeking to make some of the 80 million that the state has provided for interest costs on borrowing available to spruce up railroad and subway stations Theres nothing like painting a station during an election year said one state official Negotiators for the legislative leaders voided a plan by the State Department of Motor Vehicles for centralizing the distribution of new drivers licenses which will bear drivers photographs This was partly at the request of the states county clerks who wanted to keep that job and partly because many officials here  including some in the Governors office  doubted that centralizing licensing was a good idea And the Legislature has made sure that the board that oversees servicemens voting  an agency that has often provided remunerative employment for political leaders  will not be abolished as Mr Carey had suggested The board has had 103000 restored by the Legislature

"ABORTION AFFECTS MEN, TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/abortion-affects-men-too.html,Pamela Black is a freelance writer who occasionally works as an art assistant for this magazine By Pamela Black al Winslow and his girlfriend Sue Leydon lived together for about a year in an apartment on Manhattans Upper West Side They had occasionally discussed marriage but when Sue discovered she was pregnant the subject took on new meaning Hal was stunned But he was prepared to stand by Sue and see the pregnancy through Without talking about it in much detail the couple tentatively agreed to marry and have the child Hal describes the three days that followed their decision as a halcyon time spent basking in the early summer sun and the glow of prospective parenthood At 27 Hal his name and those of other people whose personal experiences are described in this article have been changed except where noted was moved by new feelings of growth and stability at the prospect of starting a family a reassuring counterpoint to his career anxieties He was suddenly struck by a new sense of definition an awareness of the roots of his own childhood in a large Roman Catholic family in the South But Hal began to feel that something was wrong before he could name it Sue had just received her graduate degree and was embarking on a career in social work With growing confusion and horror he realized that the impact a child would have on her career was dawning on her and that she was backing out of the decision without him He loved Sue and felt pressured to go along with her After all how could he ask her to change the whole course of her life It was her choice she was the one who would have to bear the child Life would certainly be easier without it It was clear that I should defer to her Hal says recounting the experience several years later but what about my choice I wanted the child and it was like something was being taken away from me Even the decision had been taken away from me And then to watch this dream of life turned into six hours in the waiting room He shook his head sadly After the abortion Hal found himself wondering why they had not gone through with the pregnancy He began to feel that Sue had acted out of selfishness She had weighed pursuing her career against having his child and her career had won He felt rejected as if Sue were saying she didnt want to be biologically connected to him Hal could never admit this to her He was caught between trying to be supportive and feeling disappointed He began to take it out on her by pursuing his career with a vengeance They spent less and less time together The subject of marriage was dropped Their sex life deteriorated and eventually Sue moved out With more and more women working and with changing expectations among both men and women about their roles more men are finding themselves faced with dilemmas similar to the one Hal experienced With the advent of birth control and family planning couples have been free to examine their goals more carefully And in the case of unintended pregnancies men are becoming increasingly involved in abortion on a personal level Since it was legalized in 1973 nearly 12 million women in the United States have had legal abortions Much has been written studied and pondered about the effects of abortion on women Although abortion certainly affects women more than men it does take two to conceive And men seem to have been left behind in the dust raised by pro and antiabortion groups as they stampede into battle over what has been almost universally proclaimed a womens issue Realizing this a small but growing number of abortion services and family planners are beginning to advocate giving men a role in the abortion decision and process At the same time a handful of men have even gone to legal lengths to assert their right to procreate over their partners right to an abortion and the courts are still wrestling with the implications of such a potential deadlock Some men feel that since they play an equal part in conception they should have an equal say about the product of that conception Yet most feminists and family planners believe that as long as child care and birth control are still primarily a womans responsibility the abortion decision must be solely up to her Parties on both sides of the question believe that if men and women could discuss abortion more openly their conflicts might diminish A confluence of circumstances has helped abortion become exclusively a womans problem in the public consciousness The womens movement of the 1970s stressed womens control over their own bodies Even earlier the improved means of contraception that were being developed  the pill and the IUD  were designed specifically for women The availability of birth control and abortion has made men much less responsible says Jeannine Michael director of counseling at the Eastern Womens Center a gynecological care and abortion service in New York City Men used to carry condoms around Now its strictly up to the woman In the past a woman often sought an abortion because her partner refused to assume responsibility for the child It was thought to be women who wanted babies men wanted their freedom Abortion counselors still hear horror stories about men who abandon their pregnant girlfriends Indeed the prospect of being slapped with a paternity suit or haunted by an unknown child prompted one man to ask for his girlfriends receipt after her abortion But evidence exists that many men are deeply affected by the controversial procedure whether or not they wanted a child His own troubling experience with abortion led Arthur B Shostak a professor of sociology at Drexel University in Philadelphia to undertake one of the first preliminary studies of mens reactions to abortion In his survey of 100 Philadelphiaarea abortion veterans Shostak found that threefourths of his subjects felt it had been a difficult experience that left them with lingering doubts or thoughts about it While a majority of his sample believed in a womans right to abortion nearly half of the men felt moral conflict about it and 56 percent subsequently had dreams about the child they might have fathered Eightyone percent of his respondents favored some kind of abortion counseling for men Similarly Arden Rothstein a New York psychologist found in a 1974 study of 60 men who accompanied their partners to an abortion clinic in the Bronx that the men were very interested in and concerned about what was happening to their partners Most said they wanted to play a more active role in some part of the proceedings A sociologist and the author of the only pamphlet about abortion directed specifically to men Roger C Wade counseled more than 1000 men from 1973 to 1978 when he was director of Colorados Boulder Valley Clinic a gynecological service and abortion clinic He found that whether or not a potential father wants an abortion he like his partner always has strong and often conflicting feelings about it When Alan Howards girlfriend Martha Peale told him her period was late he was certain she wasnt pregnant He had always taken birth control seriously They bought a home pregnancy kit just to reassure themselves Alan felt sick to his stomach as they watched the little brown doughnut materialize at the bottom of the test tube Though he was happy in his yearlong relationship the 31yearold freelance writer didnt feel mature enough to raise a child Besides he felt he simply couldnt afford it Realizing it was easier for him than for Martha to choose abortion Alan was afraid of forcing his decision on her But they talked about it and Martha agreed that it was the right choice Alan accompanied her to the clinic and took care of her before and afterward But the entire time he was reeling from new emotions Even though in terms of deportment I was the model of what a mans supposed to be he says she was real frustrated with me I think I was preoccupied The pregnancy made him feel that this was what sex was meant to produce and if two people were not careful and lucky  this was what would happen Sex for pleasure suddenly seemed sickening to him If these were the consequences he never wanted to sleep with anyone again It forced us to think about under what circumstances we might have had a child Alan says And that changed the whole focus of things Rather than seeing himself as successful in his career and fulfilled in his relationship Alan suddenly found himself feeling unstable and inadequate He and Martha werent even living together yet It was sad that we couldnt bring a child into these conditions he adds But most of all Alan wanted to be useful I didnt really know what that meant or how to do it Not the formal things But emotionally I just didnt know how and if it happened again Im not sure Id know then either Similarly Craig Newton a 29yearold lawyer from New Jersey remembers the helplessness he felt when his girlfriend Judith Bulloughs had an abortion two years ago As he sat all day in a coffee shop across the street from New York Hospital wondering what was going on inside Craig recalls that he felt exiled as punishment for an unspecified offense At the same time he had a sense that he should be punished flogged for being half responsible but not undergoing the actual procedure He was caught in a net of guilt and doubt I felt uncomfortable being so removed from the situation he says But I didnt know how to get any closer The hardest part is that the man cant really participate At least the woman goes through it and feels the pain and maybe has a certain catharsis But the man feels this great lonely nothingness Its like the other shoe that never drops According to Roger Wade the most common complaint among men who accompanied their partners to his clinic was that they felt excluded The situation calls for a supportive role Wade explains one that many men are not accustomed to playing He counsels a man to give his partner plenty of time and opportunity to express herself to pay special attention to her and to reassure her of his concern and interest something many men would rather leave unsaid From my experience Wade says those women who dont get support from the man they are with are those who have the most difficult time with an abortion Every time I found out in my counseling that the man hadnt told the woman how he felt about the pregnancy Wade adds I would find out from the womans counselor that the woman was angry because she felt she had to shoulder the whole burden alone He cites a poignant example Once while counseling a man he found that he didnt want an abortion but had been afraid to interfere Wade later learned from the womans counselor that she hadnt wanted the abortion either but had assumed from her boyfriends silence that he did Some clinics around the country have begun offering counseling services to men Most clinics are short staffed however and dont have the time or personnel to deal with the men who come in Some abortion providers dont even have waiting rooms But the isolation men experience runs even deeper Men feel excluded because the power over their lives now lies with the woman says Jeannine Michael of the Eastern Womens Center In a sense a woman can rob a man of his potency once she gets his seed she harbors it and can have a relationship with a child hell never know or she can have it annihilated with one blow of a suction That is a power over life a man doesnt have The way John Rothenberger Jr his real name a 29yearold carpenter from Orange NJ sees it if his car hadnt conked out one cold spring day in 1977 he would be a father today He had helped raise his nine younger siblings and he and Sara Marcus his girlfriend of one year had often talked of getting married and raising a large family When Sara found out she was pregnant John was thrilled One day John recalls Sara telephoned from the New Jersey college where she was a freshman and told him to rush down from Orange and marry her His dead engine delayed his arrival by two days and by then Sara had changed her mind John was convinced that Saras parents had intervened He insists that thoughtful gentle Sara would never willfully have chosen to have an abortion But John had previously received a letter from Sara that outlined the pros and cons of having a child and the cons clearly won She felt she was too young and immature to care for a child she wanted to finish school and get married first and most of all she was feeling so depressed that she feared she might kill herself before her nine months were up The letter indicated that Sara was sure the pregnancy would break them up  either way If she had a child shed hate him for it if she didnt she knew hed hold it against her Still John could not see it her way He thought she was confused and letting her parents push her into the wrong decision He tried to talk her out of it offering to elope with her Not only did Sara refuse according to John she refused to see him anymore at all He was furious I didnt want to take her to court he says but I had to find a way to stop her from doing something I thought was wrong for both of us In April 1977 John Rothenberger Jr filed suit against his girlfriend demanding that she continue the pregnancy because an abortion would vitiate his rights as father to the unborn child Though the case was dismissed at the lower levels the Supreme Court of New Jersey granted Rothenberger a temporary injunction By the time it was delivered though Sara had already had an abortion Rothenbergers case was one of a handful of such court battles in the United States None of them have been successful Though the courts have consistently recognized a mans interest in his partners pregnancy they have come down on the side of the womans rights since it is she who must literally bear the consequences of that pregnancy The bottom line of the legal reasoning is the right of every individual to the possession and control of his sic own person affirmed by Judge Gerald Mager of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Florida in his 1973 ruling on the first case in which an unmarried man tried to enjoin his girlfriend from having an abortion Judge Mager determined that it would be absurd to grant a man such a right If we were to conclude that a putative father has the standing to prevent the natural mother from terminating the pregnancy would the putative father have the corresponding standing to compel the termination of the pregnancy   Could a putative father or for that matter a husband seek an injunction to restrain the woman from using contraceptives or compel the woman to bear children Such circumstances would seem ludicrous Ludicrous or not many states did grant such a right to married men When the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that the 14th Amendment was broad enough to encompass a womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy husbands rights were not yet an issue During the next few years several states passed laws requiring a married woman to obtain her husbands permission for an abortion Since this requirement interfered with a womans right to decide the Supreme Court abolished it in 1976 The Court reasoned that since the state had no right to interfere with a womans decision it could not delegate such authority to a husband Some states are now trying to circumvent this reasoning by passing legislation requiring women to notify their husbands rather than to obtain their permission According to Nan Hunter a staff attorney on the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project Where a womans afraid to tell her husband notification is the same as consent Most married women do tell their husbands and when they dont theres a good reason for it Weve seen battered women where the women are afraid theyll be abused if they tell their husbands and women whose husbands are not necessarily the father of the fetus The push for notification she says is less a victory for mens rights than for the New Right The antiabortion forces frankly admit this Their interest in the notification requirement is according to Thomas J Marzen a lawyer for Americans United for Life AUL the assumption that any kind of notification will hinder women from getting abortions The AUL was instrumental in Floridas notification battle where the requirement was upheld last October in the United States Court of Appeals Notification laws are currently being litigated in Illinois Utah Florida and Nevada Legislating some kind of male role in the abortion decision is problematic at best For that decision is only one moment in a continuum of events and assessments including what kind of relationship a couple has what efforts they have taken to avoid pregnancy and how they would provide for a child if they had one The fact is that many men do not participate actively in these other reproductive issues any more than they do in abortion The burden of childrearing still falls mainly on women and many men do not seriously consider the responsibilities involved in raising children According to the Bureau of the Census half of the men in the United States who legally owe child support pay only some of it or none at all and although the number of singleparent households run by men has increased almost twofold since 1970 those run by women still outnumber them by approximately nine to one Some feminists and family planners feel that as long as women are shouldering the burden for both birth control and childrearing a mans say in the abortion decision cannot be equal Men should never have an equal say but of course they should be included in the abortion decision says Rosalind Petchesky the author of the forthcoming Reproductive Freedom Feminist Theory and the Abortion Issue But men should be included in birth control childbearing and childrearing as well Men should consider themselves responsible for the consequences of sexuality and the quality of relationships But to say that they should be more involved in abortion before those other things is putting the cart before the horse Based on his asyet inconclusive research about mens reactions to their partners abortions Arthur Shostak disagrees He believes that abortion would be a good place to start involving men perhaps leading to progress in other aspects of the reproductive process He thinks that men dont want to control the abortion decision as much as they want to be acknowledged as partners in it Only 2 percent of the men in his study said they wanted any kind of veto power over the womans decision while 90 percent wanted an equal say Counselors agree that when men and women can air their respective differences and communicate openly with each other an abortion need not be so painful Some men say that when they and their partners were able to comfort each other through it the experience though difficult brought them closer together Craig Newton is soon to marry his girlfriend Judith who two years ago underwent an abortion He feels that in retrospect he not only grew as a result of the experience but grew closer to Judith It forced him out of his romantic haze to face more serious sides of himself and Judith Suddenly they werent just two people having a good time Craig had to explore what their relationship meant how deeply he was committed to Judith and whether he wanted to marry and have children Even though he was almost 30 the abortion made it clear to him that he was not a kid anymore And he began to think of himself not just as a lover but as a potential father and husband He felt enriched by this broadened perspective It was a mutual problem we had to face and it showed us we could Craig says Everyone fears that its a destructive process and it wasnt and to have gone through it and have the relationship survive was a victory of sorts
HOWARD BAKER TRYING TO TAME AN UNRULY SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/howard-baker-trying-to-tame-an-unruly-senate.html,Midnight had passed and the Capitol was all but deserted the echoes of occasional footsteps reverberating on tile floors Outside room S230 the office of the Senate majority leader a dozen reporters clustered awaiting word from within where a dozen Congressional leaders were in a deadlock on a major budget item with an Administration group that included James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff David A Stockman the budget director and Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan The reporters milled about impatiently missing deadlines until finally the door opened just a crack to reveal the majority leader himself Tennessees Howard H Baker Jr He pointed his Leica at the reporters focused snapped off a few shots and with a slight shrug returned to the battle carefully closing the door behind him Weeks later in that same office which looks out over the Mall and the Washington Monument Senator Baker recalled the incident I knew what I wanted to do he said in his soft measured way When the door opened I wanted to take a picture of whatever was out there I got a great picture The camera is never far from Howard Bakers side No matter how deeply involved he becomes in affairs of state he is never so involved that he does not pause to capture the moment on film Part of him is always detached There are two tracks in my personality he said One of them tries hard to do the job here The other runs along more or less parallel sort of watching whats going on Was it an overstatement to say that the camera reflected his own view of himself as an outsider No its not he replied Did he for example feel an outsider at the White House I am and always have been he said  and then gesturing at his Senate surroundings added and sort of an outsider here Mr Outside and Mr Inside observer and participant casual and calculating Howard Baker is a hard man to pigeonhole Those who know him have different ideas as to his personality his politics his goals His public image as a political moderate for example is at odds with his substantially conservative voting record Yet there is basic agreement among both his friends and foes in the Senate that Mr Baker last year compiled one of the most extraordinary records in the history of that body  keeping the frail Republican majority intact on vote after vote with occasional forays into opposition ranks consistently outflanking outthinking and outfighting the Democratic leadership Hes a genius at finding the compromise point and pushing it through said Senator Jim Sasser Mr Bakers Democratic colleague from Tennessee And on a snappy February morning at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue a newcomer to Washington added his praise As sun streamed into the Oval Office and a fire crackled in the fireplace President Reagan told a visitor Im frank to say that I dont think we could have had the successes that weve had up there without his leadership That was the Baker score card for 1981 but this year the game has changed In the first blush of the Presidents election victory Senate Republicans were united behind their leader this year they started out in open rebellion over the Administrations proposed budget and were soon squabbling about other issues as well including abortion and busing The early public enthusiasm for the Presidents economic program has yielded to dismay over the lingering recession and any hopes for Republican capture of the House of Representatives in the fall elections have all but vanished Dire warnings are heard from some Republicans that the Reagan years may have deadly longterm political fallout Meanwhile the Democrats of the Senate bulldozed and coopted by the opposition in 1981 have been sniping at virtually every Republican initiative The changed atmosphere spells both trouble and opportunity for Howard Baker Not for the first time he will be operating on a double track By definition a majority leader is expected to be a loyal lieutenant of the President and leader of a loyal Senate team That role has already proved difficult as Mr Baker has been forced to inform Mr Reagan that the Republican troops were not prepared to accept their Presidents proposed budget On the other hand the Presidents problems make Mr Baker even more important to the Reagan team a crucial figure who is taking a far greater role in policy decisions than he did a year ago eanwhile Senator Baker must also consider his own personal ambitions he has sought the Republican nomination for President and he makes no bones about his continued desire for that office That means he must maintain some distance between himself and the President in the event that Mr Reagans popularity wanes and his programs fail In 1984 Mr Baker needs to be able to move in either of two directions  as a logical heir to a successful Reagan Presidency or as the right man to pick up the pieces and rally the party after a failed Reagan Administration An impossible task Perhaps but Howard Baker has an impressive track record It has always been easy to underestimate the 56yearold senior Senator from Tennessee Short shuffling his shoulders in a sort of semipermanent shrug he gives the appearance of a man who has lost his way and wandered onto the Senate floor As he stands at his desk in the first row on the aisle his speech is rambling and tentative reflecting the backroom rhythms of an east Tennessee courthouse He tells stories A couple was touring the Capitol hell begin and go on to tell how they were astounded when the clanging bells and strident buzzers sounded signaling that a floor vote was imminent Whats that the woman asked I dont know her husband replied but one of them may have escaped Yet like many of his old courthouse cronies during his days as a criminal lawyer Howard Baker does not simply tell stories for the fun of it He uses them to break the tension both on and off the Senate floor His seeming casualness masks a careful calculation One Senate member talking of Mr Bakers outward patience and good humor was reminded of an alligator sitting motionless in the water seemingly half asleep  until the prey comes close enough and the jaws snap shut That was what happened in the Senate last year and the prospect is for more tooth showing by the majority leader in the months ahead Im the Presidents man in the Senate says Howard Baker in his quiet way but he is aware that I reserve a high degree of independence and discretion Both sides of that equation were on display two weeks ago when the President made a twoday tour of the South to generate public support for his economic policies Senator Baker was scheduled to accompany him in Tennessee but it was not until the day before the trip that Mr Baker limped out of a hospital following knee surgery He called James Baker to bow out but within the hour President Reagan was on the telephone from Camp David strongly urging the majority leader to accompany him as a show of unity The Senator complied  and used his time in the Presidential limousine to urge a more conciliatory tone toward Congress The chief topic of conversation inevitably was the budget which has turned out to be the major vehicle for the Senators exercise of independence The Administration proposals entailed skyrocketing deficits and the largest peacetime increase in military spending in history But deficits are connected in the public mind with high interest rates which are connected with the recession that has gripped the country Congress got its back up Several times a week Senator Baker led delegations of Republican Senators to the White House for meetings with the President and his aides Each time he would emerge to face the television cameras and reporters As always he was respectful of the Presidents position but he did want to make it clear that Congress simply would not accept the Reagan budget In 1981 the Presidents budget was essentially the only program on the table Howard Baker played a basically backroom role cajoling and entreating his disparate charges This year if the impasse was to be broken the Senate would have to play a major role in formulating an alternative budget and Howard Baker would have to be one of the major outfront actors sometimes in open dispute with his President Early on Senator Baker offered his own budget proposal which would have increased existing taxes and earmarked the additional income for military spending The proposal went nowhere its real purpose was to signal other Senators that alternative budget proposals were in order The majority leaders more significant role was to page 68 advise and further the efforts of Senators Democrats as well as Republicans in the face of a stubborn President The first comprehensive budget alternative was offered by a Democrat Senator Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee He proposed a freeze on spending for the military and for costofliving increases for most benefit programs Mr Baker had urged President Reagan to be receptive to budget proposals from the Senates Democrats as well as Republicans and the Senator immediately pronounced the Hollings plan intriguing But it took only two hours for Treasury Secretary Regan to dismiss the Hollings program as absolutely ridiculous Senator Baker said later I made a mistake I did not call the Administration ahead of time and say Look Hollings has got some good ideas and Ive encouraged him to go ahead and surface them  Mr Baker again called upon the White House not to reject budget alternatives out of hand And when Senator Pete V Domenici Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Budget Committee last month offered his own major proposal which bore some resemblance to the Hollings plan the White House pronounced the plan interesting A week later though in the course of a Western swing that included Senator Domenicis hometown of Albuquerque President Reagan denounced alternatives to his budget as political documents designed for saving certain legislators hides rather than saving the economy He also issued a prepared text that assailed the ad hoc alternatives coming from both sides of the aisle Senator Baker protested to both Vice President Bush and James Baker Within an hour Senator Baker received a telephone call from the President and the bothsidesoftheaisle phrase was deleted from the delivered speech Upon the Presidents return to Washington Mr Baker encouraged him to visit Capitol Hill for a fencemending luncheon with Republican Senators Afterward Mr Baker told waiting reporters that the President had indicated a willingness to listen to budget alternatives Two hours later Senator Baker received a telephone call from Bernard Lasker a leading Wall Street broker and former chairman of the board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange Mr Lasker wanted to thank the Senator saying that the Dow Jones industrial average had jumped 17 points on the strength of the Senators optimism One more statement like that he told Mr Baker and well all be wearing diamonds The battle in the Senate over the budget has set the scene for another longdelayed confrontation that is thrusting Howard Baker ever more into the fray and onto the front page Last year as the new Republican Senate prepared for its labors there was joy among such conservative Senators as Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina After years of watching their proposals on the socalled social issues voted down by Democratic majorities their party was in the drivers seat There was a lot of early pressure to get right into school prayer and abortion Senator Robert Dole Republican of Kansas recalled But the President had other ideas economic recovery was his top priority As Senator Dole put it Jesse was finally told that we were going to go ahead with first things first The conservatives accepted that judgment and in return Howard Baker promised that the Senate would address the social issues in 1982 He has proved as good as his word but for a Tennessee Senator striving to create a moderate political image it has been like strolling through a mine field Abortion for example I have more trouble with that than almost any issue he said He finds abortion personally abhorrent and he does not think the Federal Government should finance abortions except to save the mothers life On the other hand he considers it a highly private matter in which the Government should not intrude The Senate Judiciary Committee of which Strom Thurmond is chairman has approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would enable Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortion The vote opened the way for a fullfledged floor debate and the majority leader has said he will see that the debate takes place Another possible pitfall for Senator Baker the debate over extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which is about to expire Under present law the absence of minority voters in a voting district provides the Government with sufficient cause for intervening proof of an intent to discriminate is not required Last year the House of Representatives approved an extension of the law that maintains that approach but the conservatives in the Senate want the extension to demand such proof and the White House agrees Civilrights activists say that this change would effectively gut the law since racists cannot be counted upon to leave public records of their intentions Senator Baker has had close ties to the civilrights movement including close personal ties with Benjamin L Hooks president of the NAACP He has no desire to alienate these friends nor does he want to antagonize the conservatives But he has sworn that the issue will get a full floor debate and he can be expected to lead the movement for a compromise solution On another civilrights issue Mr Baker expressed fewer qualms Early this month the conservatives of the Senate pushed through a measure that would virtually eliminate courtordered busing as a means to achieve school desegregation The majority leader supported the bill and when Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut sought to hold up a vote with a lengthy filibuster Mr Baker helped bypass him in order to get a floor vote In the manner of the onceandfuture Presidential aspirant Howard Baker has not been shy about taking center stage on other issues He has become something of a familiar on network talk shows for example where he has been outspoken in his criticism of the role of the Federal Reserve System and its chairman Paul Volcker We made the first massive cut in the Federal budget in my political lifetime Mr Baker said recalling the Congressional achievements of 1981 and we made the first major adjustments in tax law targeted to savings and investment in a long time What was the Feds response Mr Baker answered his own question somewhat angrily Interest rates went up Mr Baker finally suggested that Mr Volcker should meet regularly with the President to assure a measure of cooperation The Senators political clout may or may not be a factor but the first such meeting occurred last month Howard Henry Baker Jr was born to politics on Nov 15 1925 in Huntsville in the eastern Republican part of Tennessee His paternal grandfather was a judge his maternal grandmother a county sheriff and his father served in Congress from 1951 until his death in 1964 Then his stepmother took over the House seat Young Howard and his two sisters grew up as gentry among the hillbillies The first thing that happened to me that had a jolting effect the Senator recalled was when my mother died I was 8 Next thing after that was when my father remarried I was 11 I resented her It took a while for all that to settle down After high school at the McCallie military academy in Chattanooga he enlisted in the Navys V12 program and studied engineering receiving his Navy commission just in time for the Japanese surrender Mr Baker went on to the University of Tennessee Law School where he was elected studentbody president He ran on a platform that called for mending fences between fraternity members and the independents on campus  an early example of Mr Bakers lifelong devotion to coalition politics Shortly after graduation he wed Everett Dirksens daughter Joy Says Prof John Bakke of Memphis State University a student of the Senators career His marriage could not have been better politically arranged if it had been made in the courts of Europe The Bakers have two children Darek 29 a computer specialist and Cissy 26 who is continuing the family tradition by running for Congress in Tennessees Fourth District Howard Baker set out to carve a court career specializing in murder trials A longtime idol was Ray Jenkins of Knoxville later chief counsel to Senator Joseph R McCarthys committee The most successful bit of courtroom theater Ive ever seen Mr Baker once said was Ray Jenkins representing the victims family He just sat there in the hot courthouse with the sweat from his face dripping down on a grindstone and stroked the murder weapon back and forth sharpening the blade on the wet stone In time Mr Baker himself won fame in Tennessee courtrooms as Old TwotoTen in honor of the low prison terms his clients received He also prospered as attorney for coal operators insurance companies and banks and on a major investment in lumber In 1964 when his father died Howard Baker might have easily taken the vacant House seat but he left that to his stepmother and chose to try for the Senate He was buried in the Lyndon Johnson landslide Two years later he ran for another seat and won the first Tennessee Republican ever to be popularly elected to the Senate During that interval he had made at least one dramatic change in his stance With Barry Goldwater at the top of the ticket Mr Baker had said he would have voted against the Civil Rights Act had he been in the Senate By 1966 he had reversed himself and was able to capture a sizable number of minority voters in Boss Ed Crumps Memphis a conservative Democratic stronghold along with many a moderate Democrat Asked to explain the change Mr Baker said It took from 1964 to 1966 to convince me that I had been wrong It did him no harm to have the endorsement of the liberal Nashville newspaper The Tennessean I really thought he represented a moderate stable approach to government said John Seigenthaler the editor and publisher who also was impressed with Mr Bakers character There are things that Howard Baker will not do There are things he will not say You can count on him to be rational He cleaves to the middle of the road as if the Holy Grail was there In Washington the Senator went his own way socially and politically eschewing the party circuit growing roses in the greenhouse of his luxurious rented home just off embassy row Mr Baker still spends at least one weekend a month in his ancestral and emotional home in Huntsville which boasts acres of rolling lawns and the countys first tennis court In the Senate Mr Baker often differed with his fatherinlaw on legislative issues  the principle of one man one vote for example which Mr Baker supported When Senator Dirksen died shortly after Labor Day 1969 Mr Bakers aides passed the word that he would campaign for the job It wasnt appreciated said one legislative veteran He had been in the Senate only two and a half years Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania the candidate of the Northeast liberals was elected to the post and Senator Robert Griffin of Michigan was appointed whip Senator Baker handily won reelection in 1972 and 1978 Much of his national exposure came because of his habit of helping Presidents regardless of party His first major test was as the ranking Republican and vice chairman of the Senate Watergate committee At the hearings he sought to separate Mr Nixon from the actions of his underlings pounding away at an artful question What did the President know and when did he know it According to John Seigenthaler Mr Baker thought Mr Nixon would be absolved The meanness of the Nixon Administration he said is something Howard Baker did not believe During the brief Presidency of Gerald R Ford Mr Baker was a loyal supporter in the Senate and supported Mr Ford in his 1976 primary campaign against Ronald Reagan There was speculation that he might have been Mr Fords Vice Presidential running mate but for a family problem Upon the death of her father in 1969 Joy Baker developed a drinking problem and subsequently became one of the first political wives to tell the public of her battle against alcoholism Mr Baker also cooperated with the Carter White House According to Stuart Eizenstat chief domestic adviser Mr Carter highly valued Senator Bakers help on domestic issues such as energy legislation as well as on the Panama Canal treaties In 1977 with the retirement of Hugh Scott from the minority leaders post Howard Baker ran hard for the job and won it narrowly defeating Senator Griffin As his floor duties increased many Tennesseans thought they noted a growing lack of interest on the part of the Senator in local politics That has not always been the case One controversial instance his cosponsoring of legislation for the Government to purchase a tract of land owned by a Tennessee company which Mr Baker had once served as lawyer and director Even last year during the budgetcutting crunch in the Senate such major Tennessee projects as the Clinch River breeder reactor and the TennesseeTombigbee Waterway had miraculous survival powers Yet Mr Baker has given nearly all state patronage to Gov Lamar Alexander a longtime Baker protege and Mr Baker himself says of the Governor He is the head of the Republican Party in Tennessee In fact there was a feeling that Howard Baker was becoming bored with his Senate job itself that he was ready to retire when his term ended in 1984 Then came the Reagan victory Suddenly it was a new ball game in the Senate with a Republican majority and the majority leaders post waiting to be filled Any thoughts of retirement vanished as Mr Baker thought of the new challenges and opportunities up for grabs He was an automatic and vigorous contender but there were potential problems The freshman class of Senators was as a group considerably to the right of Mr Baker Many of them for example had not forgiven him for supporting the Panama Canal treaties He knew that his only potential challenger was Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada a conservative who also happened to be the Presidents closest friend in the Senate But was he in the race The day after the election Mr Baker called Senator Laxalt at 7 AM Nevada time with a request He asked Mr Laxalt to nominate him as majority leader If Laxalt says no I know I have a problem Senator Baker told an aide If he says yes I know Im home free Mr Laxalt readily agreed to speak for Mr Baker Theres very little enthusiasm for that job from former governors Mr Laxalt said in an interview afterward Weve been there Thats heavy responsibility Thats being on the point The Republican members of the United States Senate had spent the better part of a quartercentury perfecting their skills as guerrilla fighters in innumerable parliamentary ambushes they had freely indulged their individual egos and ideologies the luxury of being dissidents as Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon put it The dawn of the Reagan era changed that Said Mr Hatfield We had to make this thing work The presence of Ronald Reagan in the White House was a central factor the Republican Senators wanted him to succeed and they knew that it was he who set the Congressional agenda But the explosive personal and ideological mix in the Senate had to be harnessed and for that task Howard Baker was the key If youre looking for somebody who could put us all in a pot and make us come to a boil said Senator Dole hes the one Hes the chef As the Republican minority leader of the Senate in the 1960s Everett Dirksen Mr Bakers fatherinlaw had been famous for his oracular highhanded approach to the job  threatening for example to withhold coveted committee assignments or hold back floor action on particular legislation as a means of forcing recalcitrant Senators to vote the party line It was a familiar technique in an era when Senators spent a lifetime in the chamber amassing political IOUs and nursing grudges Today 54 Senators are in their first term They have little sense of institutional devotion and no disposition to be bullied Howard Bakers approach to the job reflected the changing makeup of the Senate he enlarged attendance at leadership meetings for example inviting freshmen and those with a special interest in the particular piece of legislation under discussion His approach also reflected a very different personality Mr Baker is a patient builder of coalitions generous with his time and slow to anger He is also one of the great listeners of all time and a man of considerable personal charm and humor Last year for example when Senator Slade Gorton Republican of Washington wondered why the majority leader was sitting out a debate Mr Baker offered one of his downhome epigrams Aint got no dog in this fight Not that calm always prevailed There were times when wed be shouting Senator Hatfield recalled and Senator Baker would say Let me turn up my hearing aid Hed let everyone talk and talk and then hed say I want you and you and you to get together and talk this thing over and give me a brief memo on the options This created a delay and by the time we came back wed gotten it out of our system More times than not wed come to some consensus Howard Bakers first legislative campaign as majority leader was the effort to win Senate approval for the raising of the debt limit to 1 trillion Democrats in years past had generally voted for such measures  and then been forced to listen to Republican candidates portray them as wasteful big spenders on the basis of that vote This time the Democrats announced they would vote to extend the debt limit only if a majority of the Republicans voted for the measureMr Bakers problem Thirteen of the 16 Republican freshmen having campaigned on a holddownthedebt platform flatly refused to reverse themselves even at the Presidents request The majority leader turned for help to conservative veterans including Strom Thurmond John Tower of Texas and Pete Domenici of New Mexico He put them together with the recalcitrant freshmen You guys are all rookies on this team Senator Tower told them and the quarterback has called a play In the end Mr Baker had his votes His greatest comefrombehind victory last year  and a case study of the skills the majority leaders job requires  was in persuading the Senate not to block a proposed sale of five Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia We had 12 votes when we started on this thing Senator Baker recalled The House had been against the sale by the lopsided vote of 301111 A resolution of disapproval had been sponsored by 50 Senators  just one vote short of the number required to shelve the sale Mr Bakers first move was to convince the White House to make a new approach to the Saudis seeking their acceptance of some scaling down of the package but the Saudis balked Then he reached out to Democrats including Sam Nunn of Georgia an expert on military affairs and David Boren of Oklahoma head of the informal conservative caucus of Senate Democrats He also appealed for help from John Warner Republican of Virginia a former Secretary of the Navy The answer came Mr Baker said from Senators Warner and Nunn  the idea for a letter from the President to the Senate containing assurances that the Saudis had consented to a detailed plan as to just how the Awacs would be used Jim Baker and I took that and started building on it Senator Baker said One early turning point was in the Foreign Relations Committee where the vote of Senator Larry Pressler Republican of South Dakota spelled the difference between victory and defeat The majority leader put in a call to Maxwell Rabb Ambassador to Italy and a personal friend of Mr Presslers From Mr Rabb Mr Baker learned that Senator Pressler felt he needed a telephone call from the President requesting his vote Mr Baker called the President who a scant 12 minutes later telephoned Senator Pressler The South Dakotan thereupon informed the committee that he had just heard from the White House and that he was going to vote for the sale The battle was tough and gritty with the outcome in doubt as late as two hours before the 5 PM rollcall Senator Bakers patience was strained again and again He found it particularly galling for example that Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the former majority leader had failed to support the Awacs sale Support of the President on a controversial foreignpolicy initiative was one of the obligations of Senate leadership Mr Baker felt citing his own support of President Carters Panama Canal treaties For all of the emotion over the issue Mr Baker managed as usual to maintain his detachment During the vote he looked up at the galleries and saw Georgie Packwood wife of the Republican Senator who had led the fight against Awacs He dispatched an aide to bring her a rose Mr Bakers most singular achievement last year was in keeping his Republican majority virtually intact during scores of votes on the Reagan budget each item in the 37 billion in budget cuts sought by the White House brought forth violent protests from groups that had become accustomed to increases in Federal largess over the years The White House strategy was to place all the cuts in one package subject to one upordown Senate vote preventing lobbyists from picking off the trims one by one My evaluation said Senator Baker was that it was unchartered and I was unsure we could do it But when the President asked me if I thought it was the best shot that we had I told him I thought it was Mr Baker also thought he recalls that a success on the package of cuts would make for increased cohesion among his troops With the majority of the Senate he said every time they stick together it makes it just a little easier to stick together the next time Stick together the Republicans did fending off scores of Democratic efforts to embarrass them by offering amendments to the package seeking to restore funds for popular individual programs such as Medicare and child nutrition programs The Senate voted for the package 88 to 10 Motioning a visitor toward a wing chair President Reagan took the seat alongside and talked of Howard Baker and his achievement in the Senate Mr Baker frequently provided very realistic summations of what the problems are on the Hill said Mr Reagan who also spoke of Mr Bakers good sound advice But the Presidents voice took on added enthusiasm when he spoke of his personal relationship with Mr Baker A very typical thing about him Mr Reagan said was in 76 when obviously there was some feeling because I was a candidate in the primaries  he supported the incumbent President which I think was proper  but when I found myself campaigning in his vicinity he had Nancy and myself as houseguests he and Joy at their home Senator Baker has by and large been a staunch supporter of his President and not only in pushing his legislation Early this month for example Senator Bob Packwood the Oregon Republican who is chairman of both the Commerce Committee and the Senate Republican Campaign Committee said that the Presidents concept of America as male white Protestant middle class and above 40 years of age was hurting the partys longterm chances to capitalize on the 1980 victory Senator Baker met with Mr Packwood the following morning and persuaded him to apologize for expressing his views in public though he did not apologize for the views themselves The first major national test of the Reagan Administration will come with the fall elections Mr Baker expressed some modest optimism I think were going to keep our majority in the Senate he said Republican chances are helped by the fact that only 12 Republican seats are up for election while there will be contests for 20 Democratic seats The real key Mr Baker said was the economy I think weve got more time than most people think If the market decides were on the right track and the Fed decides were on the right track the country will decide were on the right track He said he was looking for an economic upturn by early fall As to his own future the Senator was typically forthright I make no bones about it he said I want to be President In 1984 in the event that Mr Reagan does not seek a second term Mr Baker will almost certainly be among the leading candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination along with Vice President Bush Other possibilities include Senator Laxalt Representative Jack F Kemp of Buffalo and Illinois Governor Jim Thompson Ronald Reagan will have either triumphed or failed and a contender will have to be able to identify with or back away from Mr Reagan and his Administration How will Mr Baker be positioned for such a run His voting record suggests that he will be ready in either eventuality On the one hand he supported all of Mr Reagans proposed cuts in social programs last year including cuts in food stamps child nutrition and child immunology He also voted to reduce inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for the neutron bomb and against delaying the MX missile That added up to a 17 rating out of 100 from Americans for Democratic Action and an 81 rating from the Americans for Constitutional Action On the other hand for all his conservative votes Mr Baker is perceived by large groups of the public to be quite liberal in part because of his civilrights position Given his record as majority leader to date Mr Baker may well be able to don the Reagan mantle in 1984 as a loyal lieutenant and a logical heir Yet if there is at that point a need to distance himself from the Reagan Administration Mr Baker will have the ammunition As early as last fall he led the fight against the Presidents September offensive a request for new deeper cuts in social programs He has taken selected positions against some Administration initiatives  the plan to dismantle the Departent of Education for example And he has criticized the Presidents proposed budget not simply at private meetings but at numerous news conferences Mr Bakers chances for the Republican nomination however are not likely to be helped by his 1980 campaign which convinced few politicians that he would make a compelling candidate He was an early dropout One problem was poor organization  the failure for example to schedule the candidate at events where he would pick up a large audience Part of the problem was the difficulty of running for President at least a fulltime job while still being subject to the demands of a Senators life That would be true in spades for a majority leader In fact Mr Baker said he would quit the Senate if he were to try for the Presidency again A more serious problem with his campaign two years ago according to some of his aides was their candidates casualness Mr Baker told his usual downhome stories There was the time he might begin and then he would repeat the question somebody asked Will Rogers Is it true Congress is all made up of thieves and rascals And then the Senator would recount Will Rogerss reply Of course its true but its a good cross section of its constituency He was his customary amiable self But he lacked the aides said the fire that could ignite an audience  or a possible financial contributor Early this month talking with a reporter about his future Howard Baker seemed his usual objective and detached self moving smoothly and contentedly along two tracks I dont have any great compulsions or overweening ambitions he said Im happy to do what Im doing Ill be happy to run for President or not That may sound complacent or selfsatisfied but its a remarkably comfortable state of affairs Well perhaps

WHITE HOUSE JOINS SPENDING BATTLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/30/us/white-house-joins-spending-battle.html,The White House joined the Senate leadership today in opposing any attempts to stall a temporary spending bill that is needed to finance seven departments of the Federal Government after Wednesday night Three Republican Senators have threatened to attach riders to the bill called a continuing resolution on such subjects as school busing interest rates and the income taxes paid by members of Congress But David A Stockman the budget director sent letters to two Republican leaders saying the Administration would oppose any amendments to the bill which passed the House last week The continuing resolution is needed because three of the 13 appropriations bills that normally pay for Government operations have still not been adopted for the fiscal year 1982 which began last October The current resolution adopted last December after a fearsome battle runs out March 31 Appropriations Held Up After that date the departments of State Justice Commerce Treasury Health and Human Services Labor and the Post Office would no longer have at least in theory the authority to spend money Their appropriations have been held up by battles over abortion school busing and other issues The fear is that any Senate amendments to the bill would necessitate a conference with the House and the stopgap bill might not be passed before the Wednesday deadline All three Senators with potential amendments are expressing sentiments that are strongly held on Capitol Hill If they do not attach their riders to the continuing resolution this week they are likely to try to put them on another urgent bill now before Congress one providing about 5 billion in supplementary appropriations for the current fiscal year One possible amendment suggested by Senator William L Armstrong Republican of Colorado would modify a provision that gives lawmakers the right to deduct 75 a day in living expenses from their income taxes while they are in Washington The deduction expected to reduce significantly the income taxes of members of Congress was quietly approved in the final hours of last years session Representative Patricia Schroeder a Colorado Democrat who favors repeal of the tax break said The only thing this body has is its credibility If we do something like this we have to do it out front Fair and Equitable Supporters of the tax concession point out that members of Congress have not voted themselves a raise in many years I think its fair and equitable and its justice said Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr Without the tax law he said Congress would soon be dominated by the imbecile sons of rich and wealthy families The second possible amendment authored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina is an attempt to dislodge from committee legislation that would virtually ban busing for school integration The Senate added the legislation as a rider to the bill authorizing funds for the Justice Department but it is now stuck in the House Judiciary Committee The third potential amendment drafted by Senator Dan Quayle Republican of Indiana would simply urge lawmakers and top Administration officials to find a way to reduce high interest rates

meant that the state would have a budget on its the books in time for its new fiscal year which starts Thursday and thus be able to pay its bills But the Governors opposition could make the final outlines of the budget a matter of dispute for weeks Budget Called in Balance During more than 12 hours of debate the legislative leaders and their supporters insisted that their budget was in balance We are not perilously close to the edge of the abyss said Senator John J Marchi a Staten Island Republican and the chairman of the Finance Committee I think it is prudent I dont see any solid basis for his objections to our budget Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer Democrat of Long Beach LI who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee told his colleagues that weve done the best we can in the worst possible year Postpones the Inevitable But Mr Carey won some support during the debate from an unusual quarter  the Assemblys Republican minority Weve passed a political budget that postpones the inevitable into a nonelection year said Assemblyman Jon S Fossel a Republican from Ossining Were talking about a budget that will eventually call for some very very severe spending cuts or some tax increases By 715 PM the State Senate had completed action on all 18 bills that together constituted the budget The Assembly delayed by amendments offered by the Republican minority and by lengthy debating finished its work shortly before 11 PM The budget includes about 306 million in additional aid for the states school districts and gives the states public and private universities 34 million more than Mr Carey proposed It also offers local governments over 100 million more in assistance than the Governor had requested The Legislature rejected most of Mr Careys broader program initiatives and most of his proposals to raise state revenues including a 1cent increase in the sales tax to finance education In addition the electionyear budget that was crafted by the legislative leaders  Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink a Democrat and the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson a Republican  used about 300 million more from special state funds than Mr Carey had suggested These funds are held in reserve by the state against a variety of future expenditures The Governor says the use of some of these funds might be challenged in court He also argues that they are one shot revenues that will not be available next year Mr Carey says the Legislature will then have to pass new taxes to meet expenditures built into the budget this year The legislative leaders say their budget  which includes 178 billion in state funds with the balance coming from the Federal Government  is 393 million larger than Mr Careys Challenged by Governor But even this figure was challenged by the Governor who has argued that many of the cuts proposed by the legislative leaders are fictitious reductions The budget includes little money to make up for reductions in Federal programs and this sparked a lively debate between Republicans and Democrats over the merits of President Reagans program Whatever the merits of the legislative leaders state budget proposal they accomplished one of their major objectives to pass a budget by the beginning of the states fiscal year Enactment of a budget was delayed for 42 days last year as the result of an acrimonious dispute between Mr Carey and Mr Anderson Last year passing a budget in May was most embarrassing to everybody Assemblyman Kremer said and we were determined to pass a budget on time so we wouldnt be criticized as being incompetent Abortion Not an Issue Both houses of the Legislature rejected an effort to bar the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women a measure that had delayed enactment of state budgets in the past Though Mr Carey is expected to veto some portions of the budget his aides say these actions will not be enough to bring about balance Mr Careys greatest power according to both legislative and gubernatorial aides lies in his threat not to sign a certificate that assures investors in state securities that the state budget is in balance His refusal to do so could block the states 35 billion spring borrowing which finances aid to school districts and to New York City  assistance that the districts and the city need to balance their own budgets Rebellion by Democrats Todays voting was marked by a rare revolt by several Assembly Democrats against their leadership The rebellion was directed against a bill designed mainly to prevent the elderly from giving their assets to their children in order to be eligible for Medicaid The bill which eventually was passed provided that people who transferred assets to others for up to two years before applying for Medicaid would be ineligible for coverage under the program The bill does not apply to homes and it exempts an individuals last 2000 in assets Opponents said the provision would in the words of Assemblyman Edward C Sullivan a Manhattan Democrat burden those who have saved money and at the end of their lives must turn it all over to the state Mr Fink needed votes from Republicans to pass the bill which according to its supporters was intended to reserve Medicaid assistance for those who most need it The Assembly also gave final approval to a bill that would repeal a 10 percent tax on the profits from real estate transactions worth more than 1 million The bill would replace the tax which was designed to raise money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with new levies affecting mortgage recording and real estate transfers The measure which goes to Governor Carey for his expected approval was strongly favored by Mayor Koch and Richard Ravitch the MTAs chairman
TOWN MEETINGS-A RELIC; by Frank M. Bryan,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/opinion/town-meetings-a-relic-by-frank-m-bryan.html,The town meeting is teetering on the brink of extinction Here in Vermont evidence of its jeopardy is everywhere as special interests make ready to pounce on the one power that the meetings have left  the power to coat issues with demoncratic respectability While Vermont still romanticizes town meetings while national figures stroke local egos by using town meetings name in vain Jimmy Carter held town meetings in Mississippi and Japan and while the towns themselves are only too willing to splash about in a pool of great issues injected too often by outside interests the state has made off with the towns political clothes The problem is that the state government has gutted the towns political power Towns dont decide things anymore During the 1960s Vermont snatched power away from its localities so rapidly that it led 48 other states in centralization By 1969 local units had less power than in any other state except Alaska A major blow came at the hands of the United States Supreme Court when Baker v Carr 1962 and Reynolds v Sims 1964 wiped out the onetown onevote basis of Vermonts lower hour Towns were divided split up grouped and clustered in a manner that struck at the integrity of the town as a political unit The consolidation of school districts and the separation of school meetings from town meetings stripped many town meetings of their gratest local concern education Welfare became purely a state matter In highways and taxation the towns towns are losing authority The fact is that towns have precious little policymaking clout left Town meetings began to be used to promote special interests AntiNixon groups placed impeachment items on agendas in several towns Then the Vermont Public Interest Reseach Group worked town meetings for all they were worth as one insider told me hoping to get a number of towns to deny various privileges to nuclearpower companies  action that the towns had no legal power to take No matter To Research Group operatives moving in on the towns the point was to publicize the issue even if policymaking was impossible In the late 1970s RighttoLifers placed antiabortion ordinances before the people If passed of course they would have lacked the force of law But the point was to use the meetings for symbolism This year Norman Rockwell fashion the pure light of democracy streamed through the windows of town halls all over Vermont and fell squarely on the nucleararms race The result benignly worded resolutions proposing a nucleararms moratorium were overwhelmingly passed in most of the 160 towns where they were brought up While one might agree that taking any step to reduce the threat of nuclear war is worth it the campaign to bring the moratorium before the town meetings left an uneasiness  the king of feeling one gets while enjoying a country auction where huddled at the graveside of a dead hill farm one hopes bo buy a milk can to use as an umbrella holder or an ox yoke to string with potted plants This is because I believe there is a deeper question of governance involved here Are localities capable of authentic selfgovernment Vermont seems to be saying no The glory and eloquence of local democracy  the very ingredients special interests are feeding on  has become tarnished If Vermonters cannot govern themselves locally who can In plain fact town meetings are being prostituted for selfish political gain even though  in the case of the nuclearmoratorium campain  many of would heartily endorse the sources of the selfishness If New England is to remain the only region in the United States with institutionalized direct democracy I would suggest this prescription 1 Let Vermont and other New England states begin to return real decisionmaking power to localities Let these powers be there for today and tomorrow If they be minimal and perhaps they must be let themat least be totally local 2 Let the elites leave town meetings alone  in short people like Jimmy Carter should keep hands off You have your county courthouse We have our town meetings Do not covet thy neighbors political institutions 3 Let the towns refuse to cater to the whims of special interests Let them seek to expand their powere in areas of natural concern laying aside the temptation to huff and puff over the great issues unless and until they have recaptured a legitimate power base of their own Perhaps then when towns speak people will listen Otherwise if local direct democracy is indeed impossible in the postmodern world then let it die alone and in peace in the hills of northern New England Spare us the indignity of being touted around the nation as glorified publicopinion polls Those who understand Vermont and Vermonters will understand Frank M Bryan is assistant professor of political science at The University of Vermont
"IN BARREN ICELAND, CULTURE BLOSSOMS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/world/in-barren-iceland-culture-blossoms.html,One night recently there was a dinner of the Althing Icelands Parliament which was founded in the year 930 and in keeping with tradition the Prime Minister spoke in verse At a recent Lions Club lunch bantering businessmen challenged each other by starting and completing Icelandic equivalents of limericks One of the most popular radio programs in a nation that still speaks almost pure Old Norse the language of the viking sagas is a fiveminute critique after the news that lambasts foreign linguistic intrusions An official committee is charged with giving the country Icelandic names for modern inventions  the word video is now under discussion  and a perusal of the five daily newspapers shows few Americanisms or other alien influences A rugged volanic island with only 230000 inhabitants Iceland is one of the worlds most isolated and civilized nations There is universal literacy virtually no unemployment and hardly any crime A tidy welfare state shepherds citizens from the cradle to the grave the percapita income 12000 a year is among the highest anywhere An Egalitarian Society It is hard to discern a class structure in Reykjavik a seaside city of boxlike utilitarian houses with postcard views of snowcapped mountains and a distant glacier In Icelands egalitarian society most people build their own houses and no one lifts an eyebrow if a garbagemans son marries the daughter of a prominent business leader Reykjavik which is 175 miles south of the Arctic Circle has three professional theater companies and an opera house Writing publishing and reading books are national passions and the capital is cluttered with bookstores richly stocked with titles in English German French Danish and of course Icelandic Books are mandatory Christmas gifts At the center of Icelands robust cultural life are the 13thcentury sagas fictionalized histories of pioneering kings and warriors struggling with their fate It was only until 30 or 40 years ago that it was possible to criticize the sagas scientifically said Halldor Laxness the novelist who in 1955 won the Nobel Prize in Literature Before that people believed every word of them like the Bible Which goes to show that the ability to read doesnt necessarily make people wise Talking over lunch at his country home with a sweeping view of the black treeless landscape the 80yearold writer marveled at the phenomenon of the sagas Some things in literature are inexplicable said the courtly Mr Laxness whose novels are widely viewed as a prolongation of the saga tradition Who would have thought that this barren hell would have produced one of the great literatures of the world Dont Know How Small We Are It is hardly surprising that Icelanders should want to keep things as they are or that all political parties are touched by isolationist impulses We are so isolated that we dont know how small we are said Bogi Agustsson a news director at the staterun television which closes down every Thursday and for the month of July We do behave like a country of 20 million We dont understand the differences between a small country like Denmark and a tiny country like ourselves People resist change in matters large and small A law makes it obligatory for Icelanders to have Icelandic names and sons are given the patronymic affix son and daughters the affix dottir this leads to a proliferation of people with the same name like Magnusson and Matthiasdottir which is how they are listed in the phone book The eerie countryside screeching winds and the long sunless winters have fostered a widespread belief in elves sprites mermen and mermaids  generally known as huldufolk or hidden people  who are also not to be disturbed A survey by the psychology department of the University of Iceland found that 55 percent of Icelanders believe in elves and it is not unusual for roads to detour to avoid enchanted spots inhabited by them Discos but No Beer The human dimension counts too The residents of a street in Reykjavik prevented it from being widened by arguing that neighbors living opposite each other would lose contact A law bans the sale of beer in the name of protecting minors even though at discotheques and abortion clinics young Icelanders are uptodate There is no stigma attached to illegitimate birth which is common Behind Icelands sturdy selfconfidence however lies uncertainty Icelands prosperity rests heavily on a depletable resource  fish  and so far no one has come up with an economic program for the day when the cod runs out If you talk about any crisis in Icelandic society today it is that the leaders of the Icelandic nation have not shown the way to the future said Styrmir Junnarsson editor of the conservative daily Morgunbladid which has a circulation of 43000 We do not know where we are going No Guard for President There are no policemen guarding the presidential residence at Bessastadir a complex of white farm buildings on a small peninsula The President Vigdis Finnbogadottir who was elected in 1980 is a woman The woman has always been very very strong behind the curtain in Iceland said the President 51 years old in an interview I think it was because we have been living with the sea And it has been an almost daily event that a woman has been left behind a flock of children without a husband The President who was the director of Icelands national theater is divorced making her election even more striking As a largely ceremonial figure the President is supposed to be above party politics but Vigdis as everyone calls her is regarded as something of a leftist like many of the intellectuals and artists who supported her candidacy She is extremely popular She argued that money was no longer the dividing line in Icelands egalitarian society Intellectuals and those who do not have education are not as close to each other as they were before the President said The difference is that before everybody participated in the Icelandic heritage But now we have a class distinction that has nothing to do with money but that has to do with an awareness of identity I hope she said that we will not lose our identity but we have been drifting into a society of consumers living with more material things than we need The nations astounding cultural life the President said grew out of this language that makes us a nation And it is this luck she said that for centuries we were so forgotten
SAVING BABIES BEFORE BIRTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/magazine/l-saving-babies-before-birth-042974.html,Intrauterine prenatal surgery will no doubt bring joy and relief to many parents whose dreams of a healthy baby were formerly unrealizable But this technological breakthrough is a medical one not a moral one the status of the fetus as patient may be different in degree from the status of the fetus of 10 years ago but it is not different in kind For thousands of years healers have been trying to preserve the lives and health of fetuses whose mothers wanted them only the sophisticated techniques and the rate of success are new But these techniques and this success are new indeed so dazzlingly new as to blind us perhaps to the fact that the moral premise of abortion remains unchanged The issue of abortion remains the issue of the right of the woman to choose whether or not to carry something in her own body No technological advances can rob her of her right to choose whether or not to keep it there JUDITH PASTERNAK Reproductive Freedom Project American Civil Liberties Union Foundation New York City

CONGRESS; WAITING FOR A BUDGET: THE PACE WOULD SUIT A SNAIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/09/us/congress-waiting-for-a-budget-the-pace-would-suit-a-snail.html,That government is best which governs least Henry David Thoreau once wrote and the second session of the 97th Congress is living up to that maxim Both the House and Senate are currently out for twoweek Easter vacations Before they adjourned Tuesday the House members earned the 75aday tax exemption they receive for each working day by voting to proclaim April 4 a National Day of Reflection and April 19 DutchAmerican Friendship Day It has been like that almost since Congress convened Jan 25 with both chambers in slow motion each blaming the other and both blaming the White House The big holdup they say is waiting for a compromise on the budget without which nobody knows how much money will be available for legislative initiatives But some believe that this legislative sluggishness is an expression of the current fad among most Republicans and some Democrats for smaller government fewer laws and for reshaping existing programs rather than initiating new ones It is a far cry from the days when Congressional committees worked late into the night formulating the sweeping social programs that became President Johnsons Great Society By those standards the legislative cupboard is bare But one can no more judge the quality of a Congress on the basis of the number of laws passed than one can judge a Supreme Court term by the number of decisions rendered Last year the Republican Congressional leadership carried its small is beautiful philosophy to an extreme by placing hundreds of legislative changes in a single legislative package Although the votes were few they were potent Democratic Delay Charged By this years standards however last year was a legislative bonanza Some attribute the current immobility to a stalemate between the White House and Congress They say Congress is still shellshocked after last years mauling by the White House in passing the Presidents economic recovery program which prevailed over the leadership of both parties This experience they contend engendered internal Congressional rivalries that have aborted legislative initiatives On the other hand some Republicans believe that the Democrats are using the budget delays and last years Administration victories as an excuse and are abdicating their responsibility to provide legislative leadership Last month in a letter to Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachussetts all 54 Republican freshmen in the House accused the Democratic leadership of deliberately delaying new legislation But Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the House Republican leader dissociated himself from this charge and said that the freshmen dont realize that a lot of work is going on behind the scenes Much of that negotiating has focused on creating a compromise on the budget for the fiscal year 1983 in the face of intransigence on the part of both the White House and Congress Theres a power stalemate said Representative Richard Bolling Democrat of Missouri who is chairman of the Rules Committee Its a stalemate between the President and Congress Democrats and Republicans the House and Senate Although concern over the budget has preoccupied the bipartisan Congressional leadership to the exclusion of most other matters Congress has managed to dispose of some legislation Resolved is the case of Senator Harrison A Williams Jr the New Jersey Democrat who resigned in the face of certain expulsion because of his conviction in the Abscam scandal Similarly the House and Senate approved an omnibus spending resolution needed to provide funds to keep the Government running But with a few other exceptions Congress has been on hold Legislative Course Changed Some Republicans say that this immobility reflects their political preference With the election of Ronald Reagan and the Republican Senate the legislative course was changed said an aide to the Senate Republican leadership The emphasis was on dismantling rather than creating This is less time consuming less exciting and less news Another Senate Republican aide said Congress is best at being innovative and going out and trying to address a new problem But its not as good at finetuning legislation to make sure its doing what they want it to do Speaker ONeill has insisted that the reason the recent legislative calendar was so spare was because the House was awaiting the initiatives of the President and the Senate The President sets the pace said an aide to the House Democratic leadership Last year he set a rapid pace but this year hes trying to buy some time This Administration is not interested in promoting new programs Hes brought legislative activity to where it was under Calvin Coolidge But some Republicans regard this attitude as just an excuse Its the Democrats mentality said an aide to the House Republican leadership They say they face a Republican Senate and a Republican President so why try to push through their own programs They say Why do something thats not going to go anywhere But if you believe in something you do it Lengthly Agendas Representative Bolling believes however that even if the Democrats wanted to do something they would be hard pressed after last years defeats The Administrations victories last year destroyed the legislative process Mr Bolling said By lumping hundreds of legislative revisions and repeals in a single bill he said the Administration created enmity between the Budget Committee and all other committees The Rules Committee is the referee he said Were trying to maintain both a budget process and a legislative process Both houses have long agendas and few in Congress believe that they will be able to make a dent in them by Oct 1 which is when they would like to adjourn in this election year Pending matters include completion of the Voting Rights Act and regulatory reform enactment of a new criminal code clean air legislation banking deregulation a new housing bill an immigration bill an omnibus judgeship bill and social issues such as abortion school prayer and busing All we have to do now is the budget and its over said an aide to the Senate Republican leadership Thats the one big mountain to cross

new television drama starring Vanessa Redgrave and titled My Body My Child will be telecast at 9 on ABC which by any reckoning is hardly a bad start for a 45yearold beginner Developed at the Eugene ONeill Memorial Theater Center in Waterford Conn and brought to the home screen by Herbert Brodkin who produced Holocaust the teleplay revolves around the moral dilemma of Leenie Cabrezi a pregnant middleaged Irish Catholic whose unborn baby may very likely be damaged by the drugs prescribed by doctors who misdiagnosed her condition She must decide between termination she refuses to use the word abortion or running the risk of having a deformed infant If the story on its most urgent level is one of a womans agonizing personal odyssey from selfdoubt to selfaffirmation the genesis of the script originally called The Lilac Season represents a similar creative odyssey for its author though not to hear Mrs BurnsBisogno tell it anywhere near as arduous You have to realize I had never even had a drama course she recently said her pocketbook in her lap her voice sounding eerily like that of Miss Redgrave as Leenie After 30 credits at Hunter I got married when I was 18 Betty Furness with her refrigerator was the only professional role model I had ever had But when I heard the applause for the play I did for the high school I guess it just went to my head I had to write Today she has accomplished her goal having transformed or worked up as it is called a simple story of unexpected pregnancy into what Mr Brodkin calls multilevel broadbased relevant television fare that takes dead aim at the arrogance of the medical profession without losing the originals emotional impact For most writers of television material textual transformations of that sort or rewrites as they are ruefully known are not always easy to pull off While many writers resist any changes in their work Mrs BurnsBisogno did not I was a high school teacher from Brewster she said I had to teach my kids by guidelines set down by the state If Herb Brodkin said change it I changed it LilacBody in fact went through several incarnations before it reached television beginning inauspiciously enough at a New School workshop The summer following the Bicentennial my husband who is in real estate and I decided to take a course in screenwriting said Mrs BurnsBisogno We joined a workshop given by Ann Loring the current president of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and I wrote a little simple manageable screenplay Lilac Season about the individual versus science run amok I sent it to Jane Alexander  who I thought would be right for the role of Leenie  and to a drama teacher at Westchester Community College They encouraged me but nothing happened So I started turning it into a stage play Then a student in the workshop told me about the ONeill Theater Center in Waterford where playwrights and screenwriters compete for a cash prize and a television production When I called in late November I found I was a day away from the deadline I didnt have time to finish the play version of Lilac so I decided to submit the screenplay I drove to New York and found an empty metered parking space with time left on it across from the ONeill office I said to myself This is a sign for sure In late April just when the lilacs were blooming which my mother God rest her said was another sign I heard that I was one of 16 selected from 1300 entries Once at the ONeill Mrs BurnsBisogno worked with George Roy Hill the film director on LilacBody One of the major emendations to the original script  suggested during critique sessions  was to eliminate the ghoulish opening nightmare sequence in which Leenie kneels at the coffin of her deceased mother whose hand reaches out to touch her Her scream coincides with the ringing of the phone a call from the hospital that it is time for her abortion The action of the play then proceeds in flashback That scene confused everyone at the ONeill said Mrs BurnsBisogno I listened to everything they had to say and then I redrafted I was in total awe I remember once George Roy Hill took me aside and quietly asked me if I knew what a subtext was He was a total gentleman There was always that spirit of collaboration In a week I had a 50minute videotape of my play based on a critique from Hill and the other writers Although her screenplay did not win the competition Mr Brodkin whose company Titus ordinarily produces the winner for television took an option on it anyway for immediate production and the changes began to fly fast but not according to Mr Brodkin too furiously for Mrs BurnsBisogno She was he says indefatigable Sometimes we had to turn her off she was so enthusiastic She overwhelmed us The big change was the introduction of the medical subplot what I call the docu in the drama Mrs BurnsBisogno explained with all the aplomb of a seasoned professional That was a real challenge I had worked so hard to make the play tight solid But Brodkin said Lets open it up lets provide more information My original research had been superficial Although there were doctors in it my original script did not deal in depth with either the medical profession or the whole pantheon of drugs that are harmful to unborn fetuses The original had only a passing allusion to drugs After several weeks of research Mrs BisognoBurns had amassed a bibliography threeinches thick and had considerably augmented her vocabulary with words like teratogens contraindicated and psychogenic But even with my research I had a hard time getting into a medical subplot she said Then I went to a drugstore and accidentally found a motionsickness medicine with the warning that it was not to be taken by pregnant women It was a teratogen So I called the Federal Drug Administration and asked if they knew about it and when they said they had no listing for any drugs contraindicated for pregnant women came the roar inside me I sat down and started writing Leenie at one point in the play is unwittingly fed that very medication by her husband Joe As part of the medical subplot several incidental characters were considerably fleshed out Leenies brotherinlaw had only ten words to say in the original and no identity said Mrs BurnsBisogno In the new play he has been made a radiologist I asked myself What doctor is the least involved with the patient but very involved with life and death What sort of doctor is so totally removed that he would think Leenies problem is psychogenic Indeed some radiologists may take exception with the characterization Mrs BurnsBisogno has created for her radiologist has one of the few wickedly callous lines in the play Her problem he says to his wife about Leenie is psychogenic Its between her ears not in her womb Dr Berenson who in the original is never heard from after he initially examines Leenie becomes in the new incarnation an integral part of the action as well as the plays heavy Conspiring with Leenies brotherinlaw to examine her quickly he hastily prescribes tranquilizers hormones and sleeping pills to calm her down And Leenies sister is guilty in the new script of indiscriminately giving Leenie amphetamines for what was misconstrued as a weight problem I had several points to make continued Mrs BurnsBisogno The first is that medical families are often too casual with drugs Its a fact Secondly we often do many things whose consequences we really dont understand like the incident with the carsickness pills because of the subtle interference in our lives by the scientific community All of a sudden we find ourselves in situations that should never have happened in the first place Despite having broadened her original story considerably Mrs BurnsBisogno said that she is nevertheless quite content with the finished project Im absolutely delighted she said and Ive learned a lot Im much more confident in setting up a drama But I have no idea whose idea it was to change the title Im sure it was a business decision My problem with it is that it seems onedimensional while the drama is not But I learned something important from that change she concluded Once you sell your story youre not in control anymore When I read the television contract I asked How in the world can you sell authorship But you do dont you
ATHENS MOVING TO SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/11/world/athens-moving-to-separate-church-and-state.html,Greeces Socialist Government is moving to carry out its pledge to separate church and state and to expropriate the churchs unused land The Greek Constitution recognizes the Orthodox Church as the state church and provides for its financing and its involvement in many legal and administrative affairs The Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou however sees separation of church and state as necessary to end what it regards as the churchs improper involvement in official functions and it views expropriation as needed to aid underprivileged farmers and the country as a whole The Governments ultimate objective is to confine the church to a spiritual role Since coming to power in October the Papandreou administration has obtained approval in Parliament of legislation establishing civil marriage and ending the prosecution of adultery as a crime It is preparing legislation that would allow abortion on demand and has introduced a bill providing for automatic divorce after several years of separation Those wanting a divorce now must first go to the church which urges reconciliation only after reconciliation efforts fail does the case go to court Baptism Rule Will be Dropped Constantine Beis an Athens University Law School professor and Socialist Party member who is advising the Government on the issue says other measures include a bill that will make it possible to name a child without baptism by registering the name with civil authorities There will also be a law he says stipulating that the churchs administration be independent of state involvement and financing The churchs charter governing its internal affairs is now incorporated in the Greek civil code and though it is drawn up by the church it is subject to scrutiny by the Government and approval by Parliament Total separation the Governments program declares will give the church the ability to continue its course freely and independently of worldly authority allowing it to depend on its own strength and on a healthy and democratic internal organization The program also envisions an amendment to the Constitution to make all religions equal in the eyes of the state The Government which has a strong majority in Parliament seems to have widespread public support for the program as well as the political approval of the conservative opposition While in power the conservative New Democracy party had begun negotiations toward expropriating fourfifths of the churchs landed wealth Although the church opposes most of the projected changes Archbishop Seraphim the Primate of Greece has said he agrees with Prime Minister Papandreou that separation of church and state would be beneficial to both But he has also called for assurances of the clergys financial wellbeing and of the general health of the Orthodox Church in view of its contribution to the countrys history Support of Junta Charged Archbishop Seraphim was elevated to his post in 1973 by the military junta then in power Critics of the church say it gave its support to the rule of the colonels and then under the elected conservative Governments of 197481 opposed attempts at social change and the expropriation of its property Savvas Agouridis an Athens University theology professor says that the churchs reputation has been seriously harmed by this record and that separation would be beneficial to the church To prepare for the projected expropriation said Prof Dimitrios Rokos secretary general of the Ministry of Education and Religion a inventory of the churchs nearly 300000 acres of land is being made He said the Governments aim was to put to use all church land not being utilized Its plans he said include the distribution of land to farmers and the creation of agricultural cooperatives

TV: VANESSA REDGRAVE AS A WIFE FACING ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/12/theater/tv-vanessa-redgrave-as-a-wife-facing-abortion.html,MY BODY MY CHILD ABCTVs Theater of the Month presentation tonight at 9 oclock was first seriously considered for television a couple of years ago when it was submitted in a competition organized by the Eugene ONeill Theater Center in Waterford Conn The original play was written by a suburban housewife Louisa BurnsBisogno who decided to become a playwright in her 40s Although missing the top prize the piece was optioned by Herbert Brodkin a television producer with an exceptionally prestigious list of credits Mr Brodkin has indeed assembled an impressive collection of talent for this production Vanessa Redgrave no less plays Eileen Leenie Cabrezi the suburban housewife who is forced to deal with the prospect of an abortion or as she prefers to call it termination Joseph Campanella is her husband Joe and the late Jack Albertson is her father Poppa McMahon Marvin Chomsky directed The ingredients are certainly promising but somewhere between rehearsals and small screen Mr Brodkin persuaded Mrs BurnsBisogno to expand what was evidently a small personal drama into a project with a wider scope There are now tangential plots and subtexts most of them having to do with the greed and sheer incompetence of the medical profession There is even a bit about physicians spending a good deal of time on the golf course an insight that was fodder for standup comedians at least two decades ago The problem is that with the exception of the suffering heroine the characters are never developed adequately They are given a few lines of dialogue that suggest overall attitudes They are in short tired stereotypes The good doctors spend most of their time sitting around and chatting about ethics committees and the specter of malpractice suits By the time Leenies saga ends she would appear to have enough grounds to bankrupt several hospitals and private practices Having buried her mother and while trying to help her weakened father she wakes up one morning thinking that she is pregnant She has three grown daughters She mentions something about losing the little boy in a miscarriage seven years earlier Leenie believes that the new child is a kind of compensation for the death of her mother The doctors however inform her that she is not pregnant that she is merely under great stress They begin prescribing mild tranquilizers and sleeping pills They subject her to Xray examinations Friends and relatives begin giving her pills and potions designed to soothe her growing unease It soon begins to look as if she is having a nervous breakdown It is not until more than halfway into the film that Leenie has an auto accident that puts her in a hospital where she is then revealed to be carrying fetal cartilage Given a title like My Body My Child this can hardly come as a surprise By this time of course the fetus has been subjected to inordinate amounts of radiation exposure and drugs Leenie may be carrying a dreadfully deformed monster in her body Will she have the baby or will she terminate Unfortunately this production has been put together so ineptly so unconvincingly that the answer finally seems to be beside the point The only thing that is left is to watch an actress of Miss Redgraves extraordinary caliber get through the ordeal with a remarkable measure of dignity That in itself presents a problem Miss Redgrave is so strong so riveting that it becomes impossible to believe that this Leenie could ever have allowed herself to be trapped in such an incredible situation The remains are strictly for connoisseurs of disaster
COURTS WEIGH VALUE OF UNWANTED LIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/12/style/courts-weigh-value-of-unwanted-lives.html,A small but growing number of lawsuits claiming wrongful life and wrongful birth terms virtually unheard of a decade ago is stirring concern not only in the medical and legal communities but also among opponents of abortion Plaintiffs in these complex negligence suits range from parents of children born with physical and mental defects and parents of healthy but unplanned children to handicapped children themselves In the most provocative cases lawyers are asking what courts have generally held to be an unanswerable question Is it better not to be born than to be born defective If so how is the difference assessed in dollars A classic case is that of Frank and Dorothy Speck of West Homestead Pa Mr Speck is a victim of a crippling disease known as neurofibromatosis After two daughters were born with the same disease the couple decided to have no more children Mr Speck had a vasectomy which failed his wife became pregnant She then had an abortion which also failed she gave birth prematurely to another child with neurofibromatosis Split Decision in Pennsylvania A suit alleging wrongful life brought on behalf of the child Francine Speck was recently rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a split decision The court upheld her parents right to sue their doctors for wrongful birth however and the case is scheduled for trial next year Despite the similarity in terms the actions involving wrongful life and wrongful birth differ significantly both in the way they are brought and in the way the courts are viewing them Wrongful birth is alleged by parents seeking damages for the birth of a child most often a handicapped child but sometimes a healthy child The parents argue that if it had not been for medical negligence the child would either not have been conceived or would not have been born Since 1967 when the first wrongfulbirth award was made there has been a gradual trend in the courts to honor such claims legal scholars say In wrongful life the suit is brought on behalf of a handicapped child The claim is that the childs very existence is wrongful and that but for medical negligence it would not exist Unlike wrongful birth in which damages are measured by the parents lifespan damages in wrongful life would be measured by life of the child Courts in at least five states have rejected wrongfullife suits because of the difficulty of assessing damages and the impossibility of the question posed Whether it is better never to have been born at all than to have been born with even gross deficiencies is a mystery more properly left to the philosophers and the theologians the New York State Courts of Appeals commented in a 1978 decision Two years later a California district court held that 3yearold Shauna Curlender could sue for wrongful life She was born with TaySachs disease a devastating illness inherited by some descendants of Eastern European Jews Before she was conceived a genetic laboratory that analyzed her parents blood told them they were not carriers Though the Curlender case was settled quietly out of court for 15 million the decision caused a legal uproar Since then another court in California has upheld the decision while several others there and elsewhere have rejected it The wrongfullife issue is now before the California Supreme Court which is closely watched for legal trends Though the American Trial Lawyers Association has no figures on the number of cases involving wrongful life and birth there clearly have been more than 100 judging by lawjournal citations alone A 1980 article in an American Bar Association publication Family Law Quarterly cited 60 recent cases Lawyers attribute the rise in part to the United States Supreme Courts 1973 decision upholding the right to earlyterm abortion and in part to scientific advances particularly in the areas of genetic screening and prenatal testing Discussing the growing number of court actions George J Annas professor of law and medicine at Boston University School of Medicine said Youre going to get some aberrant cases and the courts will differ on damages Any time you have a new area of the law it takes awhile to develop principles Youre going to get people who dont like it Theyll get impatient and pass statutes Statutes prohibiting suits alleging wrongful life and birth have already been passed in at least two states South Dakota and Minnesota both amid controversy A third California recently passed a similar law specifically designed to protect parents against wrongfullife suit by their children The language of the laws in South Dakota and Minnesota as well as that of bills pending in state legislatures in Illinois Michigan and Missouri was developed by an antiabortion group Americans United for Life according to Thomas J Marzen staff counsel for its legal defense fund What these statutes say essentially he explained is that abortion is an exception that abortion is not the kind of surgical procedure that falls within the usual civillaw description and that physicians are not liable for failing to perform them recommend them or provide information that leads to them Mr Marzen and others in the socalled prolife movement deny that the laws are designed to restrict abortion Rather they say they are conscience laws to protect doctors morally opposed to abortion Advocates of the right of choice on abortion maintain that the laws would restrict that right and that it appears that they would make it legal for doctors to lie to a pregnant woman about possible genetic defects in a fetus They dont want abortion to be an option  said Janet Benshoff director of the American Civil Liberties Unions reproductive freedom project They may be furthering that purpose but theyre also immunizing tortious conduct of doctors which is against public policy While opponents on the abortion issue argue over legislation to bar wrongfullife and wrongfulbirth suits the courts are faced with the reality of the suits and the damages sought Homer H Clark Jr a University of Colorado law professor who has researched the issue of damages said that where negligence is found most courts now favor recovery for the medical and other expenses of a handicapped as opposed to a healthy child The courts stand evenly divided on damages for the parents pain and suffering he added According to the American Trial Lawyers Association the largest wrongfulbirth award reported by its members was 450000 in 1976 to an Ohio mother of twins one of whom was born handicapped after a tubal ligation a sterilization procedure Reported outofcourt settlements have been considerably higher A California hospital recently agreed to pay 900000 to settle a suit involving a child with Downs syndrome The hospital had not told the childs 36yearold mother about amniocentesis a prenatal test that can detect the defect If she had had the test she maintained she would have had an abortion In wrongful births of healthy but unwanted children the damages sought are generally the cost of rearing and educating the child Some cases involve failed abortions and some involve failed sterilizations  tubal ligation of the mother or vasectomy of the father An argument traditionally advanced in some cases by the other side is that the parents should have mitigated damages by aborting the child or by putting it up for adoption Increasingly the courts are rejecting this argument In a 1981 decision involving a healthy child an Illinois appellate court called abortion and adoption uniquely personal choices which cannot be forced upon parents as a means of mitigating damages Within Zone of Privacy Nor was the court persuaded by the contention that public policy deems a healthy child a blessing rather than a compensable wrong The uniqueness of life is in no way denigrated by a couples choice to not to have a child it said Neither the individual nor society as a whole is harmed by this choice The right to limit procreation through contraception and to a limited extent abortion has been held to come within the constitutionally protected zone of privacy  Noting that there is a trend to allow recovery for the birth of healthy children Vickie Greenfield an American Medical Association lawyer stressed that courts varied widely on the issue In a study of six 1981 cases in which sterilizations were unsuccessful Mrs Greenfield said she found courts refusing damages for a healthy child courts saying that the benefits of the child should be balanced against the costs in assessing damages and courts saying that parents could recover the costs of rearing and educating the child The largest award for a healthy child reported to the American Trial Lawyers Association was 110000 given in 1981 to a St Louis woman who had three children then gave birth to twins after a tubal ligation

Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/15/garden/hers.html,IHAVE just returned from celebrating the 90th birthday of my grandfather Clinton Boone Pennebaker a man who gambled all his life and won Until not so many years ago he smoked freely drank heavily and ate what he liked much of his comfortable living today comes from winnings in cards horses and stocks I on the other hand did not share his happygolucky attitude toward risk and sat whiteknuckled on the flight from his home in Tampa to New York last week carefully monitoring my watch to see whether or not I was yet safe Once we have reached cruising altitude I figure the odds are with me for a safe landing This is not entirely rational of course Landing is statistically speaking more dangerous than taking off Still I do not relax my guard nor the grip of my sweaty palm on the goodluck charm around my neck I know that should our 727 unexpectedly hit a mountain my chances of not surviving could quickly soar to 100 percent Odds are elusive I ran into this realization head on recently when I had to decide whether or not to have amniocentesis to detect possible Downs syndrome in an unborn child The odds of having a Downs syndrome child at my age 35 are about one in 200 The odds of having a complication from the test itself are also one in 200 But even odds are not always equal For a woman who is already overwhelmed with the burdens of raising say six children the odds might argue strongly in favor of the test because the consequences of having a severely retarded child would be great and the consequences of a miscarriage minimal However for a woman who at 35 was trying desperately to have her first child the odds of a miscarriage would loom much larger Just to complicate matters the odds of having a miscarriage at five months with or without amniocentesis are also about one in 200 The geneticist who gave me these numbers suggested that we consider the worst that could happen and see if we could live with it The worst that can happen if one gives birth to a Downs syndrome child is a lifetime of emotional and financial disaster tempered of course by love But then even a nonDowns child can be born with serious defects and the most perfect newborn baby can be crippled for life on his way home from the hospital On the other hand if Downs syndrome is detected prenatally and the mother decides not to have the child she must go through an abortion which means killing a fetus whose movement she can already feel Nuances in numbers often add up to matters of life or death but numbers cannot help us decide what is morally or even practically right More than 50000 Americans were killed in Vietnam The same number die every single year in auto accidents More than twice that many die each year from cigarette smokingrelated cancer But you cannot compare cigarette smoking with war It is much easier to compare apples and oranges In fact if we go by the numbers the most dangerous thing you can do is to remain unmarried especially if you are male According to a Health Physics article risk of early death associated with cancer for an average man is only one third of the risk of early death associated with being unmarried Of course statistics apply to average people and none of us is average If it happens to you the odds are 100 percent If it doesnt happen to you they are zero Everyone knows somebody like my grandfather I think thats why we often ignore the odds even when they are trying to tell us something Conscientious parents who ban cookies from the kitchen and insist on every childhood inoculation in the book often dont seem to appreciate that more children are crippled and killed in auto accidents than from all childhood diseases combined they still prop their babies in their laps neglect to insist on car seats and seat belts On the other hand hiding behind averages can become an easy way to skirt important issues to leave the deciding and the blame to somebody else Too many book publishers magazine publishers TV producers these days base matters of taste on statistics blaming the average person for the schlock they so successfully try to sell But the best editor I know  like the best parents I know works from the seat of her pants by instinct People who play their lives by numbers remind me of a friend who asked me when I told her I was getting married if I had tallied all the pros and cons if I was absolutely sure what I was doing Of course I could not have come to a conclusion by tallying all the pros and cons even if I figured out what the pros and cons were I dont think Ive been absolutely sure of what I was doing in my entire life Risk is not as objective as we would like to think I know people who eat nothing but health food but also fill up on dangerous drugs people who continually abuse their bodies and yet see a doctor every six months without fail Perhaps they think the doctor can fix whatever damage they do Perhaps they are just looking for someplace to put the blame When I calculated the risks of giving birth at home and in a hospital the mortality rate seemed to come out roughly the same I chose to bear my first child in the hospital because if something went wrong at home I figured I would have no one to blame but myself There are some things one does against all odds of course for example live in earthquakeprone California There are other things one avoids even though the odds are favorable like reaching out to other people A recent article in Scientific American concludes that for most people The threat of a loss has a greater impact on a decision than the possibility of an equivalent gain Perhaps that is why we are so paranoid about losing face losing youth losing interest We like to hedge our bets People are afraid to risk having children because it might change their lives as if that were a bad thing People are afraid to fall in love for fear they will be jilted We seem increasingly afraid to praise each other even though the possible risks are dwarfed by the possible rewards We also confuse and are confused by the difference between personal risks and social risks Just because its wise to be aware of the statistical dangers of smoking doesnt mean we need to be rude to every smoker we meet Just because its important to make commercial airplanes safe doesnt mean that people who want to shouldnt be allowed to fly to the moon Efforts to make obstetrics perfectly safe often result in a clinical approach to birth and the Caesarean rate in some hospitals is 30 percent On the other hand people who want to take personal risks shouldnt feel free to rape everybodys environment or put a handgun in every house military men who like to play with fire shouldnt be allowed to set nuclear fire to the world The greatest risk of all comes from thinking that anything guarantees us a free ride I recently got a letter from a college roommate no one had heard from in years We all thought she was very ill or perhaps even dead because she had suffered from serious tumors for a long time The letter however explained that the long silence was due to family problems it did not mention illness until the end Then my friend wrote I now accept that I have a fatal disease But I also realize that we all have a fatal disease The important thing is what we do with our lives

WHAT THE SQUEAL RULE WILL BREED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/16/opinion/what-the-squeal-rule-will-breed.html,The fertilization of pine cones is complex the process for producing sea horses requires a remarkable degree of malefemale partnership and slugs snails and earthworms being hermaphrodites are tortuously selfinvolved But human reproduction is simplicity itself  which is why celibacy is the only surefire contraceptive Celibacy however has seldom been the peoples choice and is even less of one now that recreation has so thoroughly replaced procreation as the main event Recreational sex has always been popular true but only in the last 20 years has the nation been pummeled with the message that pursuing it is intrinsic to the pursuit of happiness The children born during that time have heard that message too 24 million women under the age of 18 are sexually active Some 458000 pregnancies occur annually in this group Nearly half will end in births to young mothers who may face a truncated education poor job prospects and welfare dependency Whats to be done One can pray of course that Americas sexual revolution will go away will somehow or other be put on recall Or one can hope for the continuing success of federally funded family planning services In 1979 these averted some 400000 unintended teenage pregnancies and might have averted more if their clients had come sooner most had been sexually active for a year What these agencies provide besides counseling prescription contraceptives and followup is confidentiality That last though will disappear under a proposed squeal rule a Federal regulation requiring that their parents be notified when women under 18 request contraceptive prescriptions or devices from agencies funded by Washington The chilling effect that this rule would have is evident a recent study showed that 25 percent of the clinics young clients would no longer seek their help if parents had to be notified But only 2 percent said they would stop sexual activity The prospect for thousands more unwanted births among teenagers is obvious The argument for the squeal rule is that it would to quote Marjorie Mecklenburg head of the Federal Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs bring the parents back into the picture But its already proven that such a ruling is unnecessary for such a result Most clinics already encourage their teenage patients to tell their parents and a majority of them do so Rather than reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions the new ruling will probably raise both Yes it may bring a few more parents into the picture but its sure to drive thousands of teenagers out of the agencies That prospect does not appear to disturb Miss Mecklenburg We are not trying to keep the attendance at clinics up she said in a recent interview Why not Isnt that Miss Mecklenburgs job  to carry out Congresss intent to reach teenagers and prevent teenage pregnancy What Miss Mecklenburg seems to be saying is that anyone old enough to be sexually active is old enough to shift for herself and never mind the consequences for herself her child and the welfare rolls That attitude and this proposed regulation are not only illogical and intrusive but an example of financial planning at its worst There is still a chance though that the measure can be derailed The deadline for public comment is April 23 which means one more week in which Americans can tell Washington how they feel about the squeal rule
MORRISTOWN IS HOPEFUL OF SETTLING ZONING RIFT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/nyregion/morristown-is-hopeful-of-settling-zoning-rift.html,MORRISTOWN A PROPOSAL by Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey to move into a building a block from where it is now has taken on epic proportions in the last 11 months as the organization has sought to rebut allegations that it is undermining the morals of young people The controversy is expected to peak Wednesday night when after 10 hearings the Morristown Board of Adjustment is scheduled to decide whether to grant Planned Parenthood a zoning variance that would enable it to move into the old American Legion Hall Planned Parenthood currently rents space on Speedwell Avenue one block from the Legion building The hall however is at the beginning of a residential zone A member of the Board of Adjustment Jay Longhurst has said that the hearings at which members and friends of the Ad Hoc Committee for a Residential Morristown have attacked Planned Parenthood have made it seem like the whole theory of evolution is on trial Local and national Planned Parenthood officials say that freedom of ideas and thought are under attack by rightwing forces that want to impose their own sense of morality on others Lydia Davidoff vice president for public affairs for the National Federation of Planned Parenthood said that the Morristown case epitomized what was happening to the organizations affiliates across the country There is a national pattern of attack she said There seems to be an attack on the freedom of ideas and an attempt at censorship Anthony Lagani Jr a lawyer who heads the Ad Hoc Committee for a Residential Morristown said that Planned Parenthood was not only destroying the moral character of the country but also was responsible for an increase in abortions teenage pregnancies and venereal disease According to Mr Lagani the organizations message to children is essentially If it feels good do it The lawyer who acknowledged that his group had only 10 active members has blown the whole issue out of proportion said Edward Limoncelli chairman of the Board of Adjustment Basically Planned Parenthood is asking for a use variance Mr Limoncelli explained They want to put an office in a residential zone but this has become a threering circus The citizens group has presented witnesses including the head of a committee opposing sex education in New Jersey and a Washingtonbased psychiatrist who came to Morristown to bolster the contention that Planned Parenthood is not good for the community While conceding that the hearings have lasted too long Mr Limoncelli said he did not dare shut up the opposition for fear it would use that as a basis for an appeal to the City Council and the courts that it had not been allowed to present its case fully During testimony the Planned Parenthood attorney Lois N Van Dusen has maintained that the organizations benefit to the community has already been proved because the states Department of Health issued it a Certificate of Need for its proposed new location  Frances Smith president of Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey said that although the organizations clinic served 11000 persons in a fivecounty area last year there were at least 35000 people in the area in need of aid Patricia de la Fuente public information coordinator for Planned Parenthood the organization would spend 1 million to renovate the American Legion building
HOW THE CHINESE POLICE THEMSELVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/magazine/how-the-chinese-police-themselves.html,Copyright c 1982 by Fox Butterfield Reprinted by permission of Times Books a division of QuadrangleThe New York Times Book Company It was a cold overcast day in January 1980 when I arrived at the cavernous Shanghai railroad station for the overnight express train back to Peking A blueuniformed woman conductor was waiting beside the door to my car I had purchased my ticket the day before in an office of the China Travel Service the staterun tourist agency The clerk at the counter had not shown any particular interest in me  I simply presented my green travel pass from the Public Security Bureau Chinas police and paid for my passage I had chosen to make the trip by train a 20hour ride rather than by plane a mere twohour flight in hope of encountering some Chinese who away from the prying eyes of neighbors or office mates might be willing to ignore the official regulations against talking to a foreigner It was a tactic other Westerners in China had sometimes used with success But when I approached the train the conductors broad face broke into an immense smile Welcome to our train she said almost too eagerly You are the American reporter are you not It was more a statement than a question As I stood with my suitcase in my hand I might as well have been naked My hopes continued to fade as the conductor a stocky woman in her late 20s began walking down the car corridor Through a crack in my compartment door I could hear her stopping to announce to the other passengers in her booming voice We have a foreigner on board He is an American journalist He speaks Chinese He speaks very good Chinese That was the alert I calculated Then she returned to minister to me Please let me know if there is anything I can do to serve you My name is Ding An appropriate appellation for in Chinese ding means solid like nails and she struck me as a rare cross between a Marine drill sergeant and a cheerful overweight waitress Mustering the remains of my courage I asked Ding how she was so well informed about me The responsible comrades notify us who the passengers are so we can make preparations she replied Dings preparations included making sure that I had the compartment all to myself I was traveling soft berth in a private compartment for four people with lace curtains and thick mattresses the section reserved for cadres and foreigners The adjoining coach was hard berth for the masses jammed with tripledecker hard wooden bunk beds lining an open smokefilled corridor Still I thought I might meet someone in the dining car What time was lunch I asked Ding I will call you after the other passengers are finished she answered It will be more convenient for you It wont be so crowded Indeed when she finally did summon me there were only two other Chinese left in the dining car and they were finishing their soup the last course in a Chinese meal When they saw me they hastily gulped down the rest of their soup and left I felt like the plague As the train crossed the rice fields of the Yangtze River valley the long trip appeared a mistake In its regimentation and singular lack of privacy life in China is not much different from life in an army barracks In fact it is not an exaggeration to say that virtually every aspect of life is subject to constant public scrutiny Foreigners who have visited China including some experienced in traveling elsewhere in the Communist world often say they were able to walk wherever they wanted poking down old lanes looking into peoples houses without being followed China really isnt a police state after all they conclude But an American who has lived in Peking since before 1949 and who prefers anonymity scoffed at their naivete The Governments control system operates the other way around he explained from the inside out through such overlapping and mutually reinforcing components as the danwei or workplace and the street committee Every Chinese belongs to a danwei through his office factory school or commune The danwei is the basic building block of Chinese society almost a second citizenship for most Chinese A Chinese is more likely to be asked his danwei than his name when he goes someplace new Although technically a persons place of work the danwei often provides the housing where a Chinese lives the school where his children get an education the clinic where he receives medical care and ration cards for his rice cooking oil and soap Before a Chinese can get married he must get permission from the party secretary of his danwei if a couple want to get divorced the danwei must first approve In a sealed envelope in the personnel section of each danwei is a confidential dossier for every employee It contains not only the usual elements of biography  a persons education and work record  but also any political charges made against him by informers in the past and the partys evaluation of him In addition the file lists the persons class background for three generations whether his grandfather and father were landlords and capitalists or poor peasants and workers Before anyone can be transferred from one city to another or from one job to another he must have a letter from his danwei confirming that his dossier has already been forwarded to his new unit His danwei also controls his right to travel Before a Chinese can make a trip from his city or village that will take more than a day he must get approval from the party secretary of his danwei He must come up with a concrete reason for needing leave a sick parent for example because the only regular vacation time in China is six national holidays a year If a traveler wants to get a hotel room he must first present a letter from his danwei This is recorded and his name sent to the local police station If the danwei exercises control over Chinese in their workplace the urban street committee provides the Government with a mechanism to watch them at home On home leave one day in the early 1970s my friend Weidong  the star on the armys basketball team  and another soldier from his regiment first went out drinking and then at his friends suggestion visited a young female acquaintance by the name of Hong I have altered the names and minor details of my Chinese friends lives to protect them When they arrived at her apartment red in the face and smelling of liquor she pushed them out Intrigued by the attractive young woman Weidong surreptitiously returned to her apartment later that evening But an elderly woman neighbor who was a member of the buildings street committee had chanced to see Weidong sneaking in She had immediately summoned the police and they arrived within minutes The next day Hong was taken away by the police The daughter of intellectuals both her parents were professors with suspect overseas relations she was charged with trying to seduce a soldier and the son of a general Weidong tried to use his fathers connections to get her released He even went to a Peking court and confessed he was to blame but to no avail Hong ended up spending a year in jail After her release Weidong and Hong over the objections of their families dated each other and eventually married Weidong had been warned by his parents that he would become unreliable in the partys eyes if he had any relationship with Hong and when he continued to see her his commanding officer told him his military career was finished and he was demobilized He is now a lowlevel cadre in a foreigntrade corporation while she is a translator In the fivestory concrete building where they moved to after their marriage the representative to the local street committee was a rotund graying illiterate woman in her 50s named Ma Mrs Ma was not a party member but she was energetic and shrewd In action Mrs Ma was a building superintendent police informant social worker and unionhall hiring boss The powers of the street committee are not codified in law  for members of such a committee are considered representatives of the masses rather than the police  but that only gives them more authority Weidong said Their most terrifying power is that they can search your house whenever they want Weidong related The police are supposed to have a warrant but the street committee cadres can come in when they please Usually three or four members of the street committee middleaged women like Mrs Ma would just barge in without knocking after midnight when Hong and Weidong were asleep Their excuse is that they are here to inspect our hukou the household registration certificate The street committee was checking to see if there were any people from the countryside living illegally in Peking  relatives of the family perhaps If we have friends over even for dinner Mrs Ma may walk in and ask who they are Hong interjected Its very humiliating If you dont cooperate she can call the police and they will come over and ask the same questions The streetcommittee cadres are not paid a regular salary but they can count on small gifts of meat vegetables and rice from residents who want to keep on their good side More important their posts put them in a position to help their families and friends for it is the street committee that passes on recommendations about job assignments to the city labor department for unemployed young people in the neighborhood It is also the street committee that advises the municipal housing office about which families need new quarters In recent years the street committee has gained a further and extraordinary power  the right to decide which couples in the neighborhood may have children This prerogative is part of the Governments tough new birthcontrol campaign that aims to reduce Chinas rate of population increase to zero by the year 2000 by encouraging families to limit themselves to one child Under the drive each province and city has been awarded quotas for the number of babies allowed to be born per year and the street committee then determines which families may use the quotas We give first preference to couples without children said Mrs Tian another energetic middleaged streetcommittee member I got to know If a family already has one child we ask them to wait at least four years before having another or better not to have a second baby If a couple already has two children or more we tell them not to have any more Mrs Tian was frank about how her street committee administered the program We assign a person to keep track of each womans menstrual cycle If someone misses her period and isnt scheduled to have a baby we tell her to have an abortion There isnt room for liberalism on such an issue The reason for this stringent program the most ambitious familylimitation plan in history is the dismal arithmetic of Chinas population figures In AD 2 when Chinas first census was taken there were 596 million people in the country in 1840 412 million and in 1949 540 million In other words it took about 4000 years of recorded history for China to reach its first 500 million people But in the past three decades under Communist rule the population has almost doubled to one billion all in a country only slightly larger than the United States The control apparatus operates in less overt ways too Because Pekings leaders firmly believe that information is power  especially the power to shape peoples minds  they are chary about disclosing anything no matter how trivial I had my first taste of the national mania for security and secrecy on my first day in residence Using the telephone in China I found out requires a special technique  not in dialing the number but in eliciting a response from the person you are trying to reach I had just arrived in Peking and was calling the personnel office of the Diplomatic Services Bureau to inquire about hiring a Chinese assistant for The New York Times The conversation  in Chinese  went like this Hello is this the personnel office Im not too clear said a diffident voice Is there anyone there who knows if this is the personnel office I tried again Theyve just gone out the voice answered What do you want Im the new correspondent of The New York Times and want to hire an assistant Whom do I contact Im not too clear the voice said retreating once more Can I make an appointment to come over and talk to someone in your office about an assistant I said trying a new tack Please give me your phone number Will someone call me back later I asked my hopes by this time fading Im not too clear With that the person hung up Rule No 1 in making a telephone call I learned soon enough is never give out any information  it could be a state secret and get you in trouble But the lengths to which people go to avoid identifying themselves or divulging facts on the phone often reach comical proportions When one Chinese calls another the person answering the telephone always begins by saying Wei the Chinese equivalent of Hello Even if you are calling an office like the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry the official Government spokesman the clerk who picks up the phone never answers by saying This is the Information Department It is up to the caller to guess whether he has dialed correctly But to add to the confusion most times the person who initiated the call is also unwilling to identify himself So neither party can be sure whom he is talking to until one finally relents and takes the daring step of giving out his organization or name The Government itself goes to extraordinary lengths to try to encase its workings in secrecy In 1980 disturbed by a number of foreign press reports on developments inside the Politburo Peking pointedly republished a Draconian set of Regulations on Guarding State Secrets first issued in 1951 The law is a detailed document enumerating 15 categories of information that must not be revealed anything touching on the armed forces national defense foreign affairs the police state economic planning culture public health ethnic minorities warehouses even weather forecasts The 16th article of the law covers all state affairs which have not yet been decided upon or which have been decided upon but have not yet been made public For good measure a 17th article specifies the law also includes all other state affairs which should be kept secret This fetish for secrecy means that Chinese must do without some everyday information that Westerners take for granted Whenever I arrive in a new city one of the first things I do is purchase a map so I can learn my way around In Peking I bought a copy of the standard busroute map that the Government publishes in Chinese But my friends the Wangs a middleaged couple who frequently invited me to dinner  laughed at me It is not really accurate they confided The angles and dimensions of the streets and the locations of some important buildings have been distorted to foil Western intelligence In keeping with the Chinese leaders strict rule of discretion the capitals important buildings are devoid of identifying marks There is no sign in front of Zhongnanhai the tall redwalled compound next to the Forbidden City where the top party and Government leaders work There is no plaque to identify the drab yellowbrick building in the western suburbs of Peking that houses the Central Party School In addition most offices factories schools and even apartment buildings throughout China have walls around them and guards at the gates Outside the new whitewashed walled compound of The Peoples Daily in Peking two sentries of the Peoples Liberation Army stand guard with rifles Everyone going in and out must show a special work pass from the paper When I asked an editor of The Peoples Daily why they needed so much protection he replied Because it is one of the most secret places in China Much of the information we handle is secret A professor at one of Pekings universities laughed when I complained to him about the excessive precautions He invited me for a walk down the Avenue of Eternal Tranquillity to the western wall of the Forbidden City There running for several hundred yards was a threestory building that looked like part of the palace with the same madderrose walls and mustardyellow tiled roof But my companion urged me to look more closely The windows on the west side of the building which faced the party and Government headquarters in the Zhongnanhai compound across the street were only painted to look like windows the whole edifice was a facade In 1973 the professor related when the new 17story wing of the Peking Hotel was being completed the Public Security Bureau discovered to its horror that a guest looking west could peer down across the Forbidden City and into the secret recesses of the Zhongnanhai  if he had very strong binoculars Wang Dongxing then head of Mao Zedongs Praetorian Guard a special army division known only by its numerical designation  the 8341 unit devised the idea of putting up the facade as a security measure It was outrageous the professor lamented squandering millions of yuan on that hoax when satellites can take photos from the sky Even something as ordinary as a telephone directory presents a problem in China When I first arrived in China there was a Chinese telephone book but it was supposed to be kept secret from foreigners It was 190 pages long and was issued to offices by special subscription through the post office An individual could not just walk in and buy one As a favor a friend one day smuggled out her offices copy of the telephone book to show me It had been published in 1975 four years before and not updated since I noticed The telephone book contained odd lacunas All the listings were for offices there were none for individuals Only a few privileged Chinese have phones in their homes it is true but the omission helped me understand why Chinese are always nervous about losing the little pocketsize personal phonenumber booklets they carry with them In 1980 as part of its effort to become more open the Government for the first time issued a 30orsopage public phone book The first number in the book is that of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress followed by the Supreme Peoples Procurate relatively powerless organizations The Communist Party Central Committee the nations most puissant body which controls the entire structure of Government ministries is included under the heading Partisan Organizations But the directory gave only two numbers for it  one for the reception center for petitions from the masses the other the United Front Work Department Telephones are hard to get in Peking  there is an installation fee of 1900 yuan about 3500 or almost three years salary for an average worker and a years waiting list Only officials have telephones of their own my friend Hong said and all public phones are in shops offices or apartments of people who work for the police It is one of the most basic mechanisms of Government control They report to the police whenever there is a suspicious phone call especially from foreigners like you said Hong Phone service is erratic and phones often emit strange buzzing and clicking noises and it can take several minutes to get a dial tone signs most foreigners assume that someone else is listening During the 1980 visit to China by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown when he was being feted at the Great Hall of the People he ordered an American diplomat to send an urgent message back to Washington for him The diplomat was uncertain as to how to proceed and asked a liaison officer from the Peoples Liberation Army for help He was immediately taken to a central communications room inside the bowels of the Great Hall that had a bank of red phones When the American picked up the phone he noticed the connection was marvelously clear unlike anything he had ever heard in China before The special telephones are only one aspect of the Governments careful control of access to information Each party Government and army unit distributes its own classified documents Like most things in China information can be acquired not with money but through ones connections The higher an officials rank the better informed he can be The principle is to keep the leaders wellinformed without contaminating the minds of the masses Complementing the classified documents is a hierarchy of neibu literally internal or restricted publications that go far beyond what is available in the open media There are four layers of these internal bulletins my Chinese friends told me the narrower and more highlevel the circulation the more complete candid and interesting the contents At the bottom is a fourpage tabloidsize paper called Reference News which reprints articles from the foreign press about international events and carries some dispatches by Western journalists in Peking about domestic Chinese developments While foreigners in China may not legally buy or read Reference News any Chinese can subscribe to it and the papers circulation of more than 10 million is nearly double that of the official party newspaper The Peoples Daily At the next level above Reference News is Reference Material a much richer and more detailed digest of foreign news articles that is printed twice a day It is available only to party members and cadres through their danwei not to individuals and is printed in large characters to help the fading eyesight of elderly officials At a still more rarefied level is a group of publications known as neican internal reference which are distributed only to officials above grade 12 on the ladder of 24 ranks equivalent to deputy cabinet ministers Each ministry puts out its own compendium of unvarnished reports about its area of responsibility Finally there is a special digest for members of the Central Committee and the commanders of the large military regions Called Cable News it contains major Chinese and international news flashes and is similar to the daily briefing the American President gets each morning from his nationalsecurity adviser Surprisingly television has been allowed to drive a wedge into the Governments system of controlled access to information China established its first television station only in 1958 and until 1979 there were fewer than five million television sets in the whole country of a billion people But now suddenly the Chinese are becoming as addicted to television as Americans and Japanese at least in urban areas where the ownership of sets is concentrated In 1980 the Government took the liberal step of adding 20 minutes of international news  picked up by satellite from Visnews in Britain and UPITN and ABC in the United States  to its halfhour national news broadcast each evening Before the evening news had been largely a turgid rehash of stories from The Peoples Daily plus some dreary homemade features on the latest improvement in machinetool production But now in living color without censorship the Chinese could watch the Pope touring Africa Ronald Reagan winning the American Presidential election political terrorism in Italy even stockcar races in North Carolina and surfing in Hawaii After 30 years of almost total isolation from the outside world the Chinese were being fed a rich confusing diet of exotic new images Television it seemed to me was likely to have a number of unintended side effects on China For the Communists it could be a useful new propaganda tool but it also tended to break down the old stratified system of rationed information It gave the Chinese a much better appreciation of how wide a political and economic gap separated them from the United States Western Europe and Japan and it bred a desire for more consumer goods particularly television sets If television threatens to break down the Governments control of access to information Chinas libraries have preserved it in its pristine form The library at Peking University a modern concrete and glass structure is one of the newest and most impressive buildings on its treeshaded campus Although the library houses three million volumes the second largest collection of books in China after the Peking National Library near the Forbidden City there is no central card catalogue Instead I learned on a tour of the building each department has its own individual catalogue scattered among a labyrinth of corridors and small rooms most without identifying signs The division serves a purpose A student may borrow books only in the field in which he or she is majoring A math student cannot take out books from the Englishlanguage section not even a volume of Shakespeares plays or Mark Twains stories a history major is barred from the philosophy department though he may need a book on Plato or Confucius After you have found the number of the book you want you take it to the main chargeout counter in a clamorous room crowded with knots of students shouting to get the attention of the few clerks who are dressed in long beige smocks to protect them from dust The library stacks themselves are closed except to a few privileged professors and libraryscience majors so students are totally dependent on the clerks like supplicants At least half the time they take your slip walk into the stacks go only a few steps and without even leaving the main aisle check off We dont have it  a student studying library science related One problem she added is that most of the clerks are former peasants or factory workers with only a primaryschool education Censorship in China is both subtle and pervasive It is designed to be so allencompassing that it blots out facts of life that Deng and the Politburo do not want to exist I was reminded of this when the Chinese press in 1980 suddenly discovered that the countrys longtime model agricultural unit Dazhai was a fraud Since Mao glorified Dazhai in 1963 proclaiming In agriculture learn from Dazhai millions of Chinese pilgrims had trouped to the small production brigade of 83 families on 250 acres of stony arid land in Shanxi province in the northwest But that had been Maos version of Dazhai Now Deng saw it differently Hua Guofeng his colorless but stubborn opponent for the partys leadership had continued to extol the virtues of Dazhai Further one of Huas few remaining supporters was the former party secretary of Dazhai a peasant turned Politburo member Chen Yonggui So for Deng Dazhai became a symbol of all that had been wrong with the Maoist way and a handy instrument with which to dishonor Hua The Peoples Daily confessed that Dazhai had not really relied on its own efforts to terrace its rocky hills and dig its irrigation ditches actually Dazhai had accepted millions of yuan in Government subsidies and help from battalions of army laborers Dazhais everincreasing grainproduction figures were fake too a lie by the local authorities its output had actually gone down year by year Not only that but during the Cultural Revolution Chens persecution was responsible for the death of 141 people Now all those millions of signs In agriculture learn from Dazhai would have to be painted over This kind of comprehensive censorsorship of turning black into white and white into black to use a popular Communist slogan is tireless work requiring endless attention to detail At a photographic exhibition on the life of Zhou Enlai in Pekings huge Stalinesque sandstone Museum of History one of the pictures showed the party leadership attending his funeral in January 1976 In the solemn rank of mourners there were four blank spaces gaps in the line Once I guessed these had been the Gang of Four Courtesy of the visit by Defense Secretary Harold Brown to Peking I managed to make it into the Military Museum but only one of its two wings was open that commemorating the Red Army before 1949 The other covering the history of the Peoples Liberation Army after 1949 its fighting in the Korean War and its border skirmishes with India and Vietnam was off limits Why the difference I asked my guide We have not yet come to a conclusion about certain things she replied with a straight face Translated it meant that it was difficult to decide what to say about Lin Biao the former Defense Minister and military hero who had been officially accused of trying to assassinate Mao in 1971 What was striking about these incidents was that the partys monopoly of the means of communications makes it very difficult for the Chinese to know what to think about anything We are a nation where the Government controls not only the present but the past commented Bing a friend of mine in her late 20s whose father had been imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution for being a capitalist roader She had been given an essay of George Orwells by one of her foreign teachers Looking Back on the Spanish War and she quoted a passage she thought applied to China  If the Leader says of such and such an event It never happened  well it never happened If he says that two and two are five  well two and two are five This prospect frightens me much more than bombs   Despite the fact that a vast apparatus is in place to control the thoughts and behavior of the populace every now and then quixotic acts break through the humdrum surface of daily life Once on a cold winter afternoon driving back to the Peking Hotel I noticed a young policeman on his elevated traffic box hail a woman cyclist who was trying to cross the intersection He was shouting at her for some apparent violation but she wouldnt stop So the policeman dismounted from his stand grabbed her bike by the luggage rack on the back and threw her off balance to the pavement The woman was incensed She jumped up whacked the policeman on the shoulder punched him in the chest and then for good measure yanked off his stiff bluecotton cap and hurled it across the street In turn he took her by the arm and marched her over to a whitepainted police sentry stand on the corner She was a poor woman in her late 30s with tired eyes and rough skin I noticed she was wearing a worn corduroy jacket baggy bluecotton pants and thin cotton gloves which had been crudely mended Her cotton shoes were old and much too thin for that time of year Several more police soon arrived and confiscated her bicycle ordering her to report to a nearby police station to be questioned But how can I get there if you lock up my bike she protested By this time a crowd of several hundred bystanders had gathered There are few movies and plays to go to in Peking and tickets are hard to come by anyway so a crowd will gather to watch almost anything especially a fight with a policeman A teenage boy stepped up to the woman ignoring the police and said Here ride my bike to the station Yet despite such occasional acts of bravado the ubiquity and intensity of the control apparatus have generated tremendous psychological pressures on the Chinese creating mental strains that few Westerners can imagine People live under constant tension remarked a dignified taciturn engineer You always have to worry about someone you know betraying you he explained someone in your danwei or your street committee This pressure has been compounded by the years of political campaigns the constant shifts in the official line and the widespread political persecution the engineer added To try to minimize the dangers he said he follows one major precaution  he never talks about anything personal with people in his danwei For the next time a campaign comes up the party will order criticism meetings in your danwei and people will be compelled to say anything they know about you whether they like you or not So I make my friends with people outside my office The engineer and his wife both complained about suffering from what they called shenjing shuairo literally weakness of the nerves or medically neurasthenia what Westerners identify as nervous tension depression and anxiety Over time I found many of my Chinese friends talked about having shenjing shuairo David Eisenberg a young American doctor from Harvard Medical School who was doing research at the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Peking spent a month observing how patients were treated in the acupuncture clinic of the hospital He was the first American permitted actually to work in the hospital More than a quarter of the 100 patients he saw complained about nervous tension While the Chinese doctors prescribed a course of treatment with needles for the headaches insomnia and fatigue Dr Eisenberg as an experiment inquired whether the patients had any emotional problems that might have triggered their symptoms One young man said no he didnt have any personal problems but a few days ago his fiancee had been stabbed to death by two guys Dr Eisenberg recalled Among the other patients some were depressed by conflicts with the cadres in their danwei from whom they couldnt escape Another man was catatonic He couldnt speak or move and seemed numb When Dr Eisenberg asked a companion who had brought him into the clinic about his history it turned out he had just been released after spending nine years in solitary confinement in prison Psychology as a field of study was branded a bogus bourgeois science by the Government in 1957 and banned Most of Chinas small number of Westerntrained psychologists were arrested and packed off to labor camps a psychologist who earned his PhD at Columbia University before 1949 told me Shortly before I left China I met a woman psychologist in her late 50s who had been allowed to resume teaching her specialty again in 1978 after a 20year hiatus Her books had all been burned years before but her own spirit was still youthful almost feisty and she was deeply interested in the implications of psychology for China Had she noticed that many Chinese complained about nervous tension I asked Her dark eyes stared at me intently for a moment and I wondered if I had trespassed onto forbidden territory But then she broke into a passionate discussion After what we have gone through in the past 30 years the whole country is depressed she said her eyes flashing Depression and anxiety are our psychological scars I worry about this every day
THE ALTERNATIVE TO ARMS CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/magazine/the-alternative-to-arms-control.html,While anyone in his right mind is in favor of nuclear disarmament I am skeptical of the capacity and willingness of governments to achieve it in any fundamental measure The skepticism is based on the history of disarmament in our century  a long painful repeatedly frustrated always futile effort Disarmament is a mirage and a willothewisp concluded Salvador de Madariaga of Spain chairman of the League of Nations Disarmament Commission and Disarament Conference No person has ever been better qualified to judge Persistent failure of an endeavor should cause it to be reexamined not continued forever in the same manner Another way must be found to control nuclear war not necessarily ruling out disarmament but laying a new foundation for nonbelligerent coexistence This may be the time to seek it out because a new element has entered the situation  an impelling fear What follows will not be a discussion of weapons and strategies nor an analysis of coupling and decoupling windows of vulnerability launchonwarning first strikes theater deployment or any other of the nuclear esoterica Nor will it discuss the apocalyptic consequences of nuclear use the deaths devastation radiation and destruction of the human home of which I assume most people are fully aware A major predicament of the subject of nuclear arms control is that it is virtually incomprehensible to the layman I am a layman and I find it impossible to grasp the verifiable facts and potentials of nuclear weaponry because experts on both sides of the argument  the argument that is between advocates of more arms and advocates of disarming  give us diametrically different statements of fact or what they say is fact One side says the Russians are ahead the other that we are ahead one that we must close the gap the other that there is no gap one that they can hit us before we can hit them the other that the case is the reverse The public reads statements of the number of United States warheads that range from 9000 to 30000 and a similar range of variation exists for the Russians Of course the variation depends on what is being counted but since that is almost never precisely indicated one cannot draw useful conclusions and perhaps it does not matter because no belligerent will ever have a chance to launch 9000 warheads much less 30000 The public has no way of checking any of these statements or of knowing the truth indeed there may be no truth Unlike all other arms systems prior to actual use nuclear missiles have never been tried out in maneuvers Their explosive power has been tested but not their performance in battle or in the destruction of nations which should make one wary of all the dogmas If there is one thing more certain than any other it is that wars develop in ways that are unpredictable The Maginot line failed totally to perform the function it was designed and maintained for The Luftwaffe and V2 rockets did not knock out Britain As between the North Vietnamese supply lines and our B52 bombers the result was not what the Air Force promised or expected In nuclear war once communications and cities are blasted decision making could fall into chaos How would the belligerents if appalled by what they had done reach each other to stop the firing Will missiles with live warheads flown over the magnetic pole operate with the accuracy they did when tested without warheads inside our own borders What about the speculative phenomenon interestingly called fratricide meaning the effect of warhead explosions on fellow warheads targeted in the same direction These are unpredictables already considered which only means there will be many more no one has yet thought of The area of unknowns should warn us against taking announced doctrines and strategic scenarios on faith At the other end of technology and strategy is the peace movement  the wish for peace world government brotherhood and all those goals of good will that humanity craves and has never attained I am skeptical of peace Peace has not figured among the notable achievements of mankind It is the most talked of and least practiced of all social endeavors Men  and in this case I mean the male gender not the species  are always saying they hate war and war is hell and so forth and have continued to engage in it lustily aggressively and ceaselessly since the beginning of recorded history and doubtless before Historians have estimated that society has spent more time fighting than in any other activity except agriculture Sumerians Babylonians and Assyrians Egyptians and Israelites Greeks and Romans Scythians Carthaginians Huns and Goths Mongols and Turks Celts and Saxons Europeans and Americans Chinese Japanese and Moslems have fought each other or among themselves or against some opponent at every stage of civilizationPeace is brief as fragile and transitory as apple blossoms in spring Moreover because it engages deep feelings it produces sentimentalizing and distance from realism Somewhere between the strategists and the peace movement we must find an area for creative thinking It may lie in control the control of war Of course that is certainly no new idea although its history has been negative In the early Middle Ages when war was constant and indeed the gentrys profession an attempt was made by the church to restrict its havoc by means of the Truce of God During the truce fighting was to be suspended on saints days Sundays and Easter and all noncombatants  clerks peasants merchants artisans and even livestock  were to be left unharmed by men of the sword That was the theory in practice the truce was a sieve consisting mostly of loopholes The concept of just war  that is war in response to a wrong by the other side  was another effort to restrain the impulse to war It was paid a great deal of attention largely because the claim of a just cause entitled the belligerent to unlimited loot with a free conscience loot being the primary object of medieval war Since as we all know ones own motives are always just the justwar concept never deterred anyone as far as I am aware from aggression It was curious to see it turn up a few weeks ago in a protest by members of the Harvard Divinity School calling for a worldwide freeze on production of nuclear weapons They stated that While there may have been just wars in the past the inability to place traditional constraints on nuclear war now makes any moral justification impossible While that is admirable and true the authors had they been historians would have known that socalled traditional constraints have never been more than a verbal screen The history of control belongs largely to our century the Terrible Twentieth whose unconfined violence has made the need so compelling That history has included attempts at disarmament or limitation of arms international arbitration international organization in the form of the League of Nations and the United Nations with covenants and sanctions and systems of collective security Even a pact of renunciation of war was signed by all the nations that counted in 1928 Major international effort began with the first Hague Conference on disarmament in 1899 followed by a second Hague Conference in 1907 Forced into existence by public pressure arising from fear of the swelling armaments industry and by the efforts of several extraordinary individuals the Hague Conferences were a response to the frightening dynamics of the machine age which seemed to be rushing toward explosion In the same years Alfred Nobel proposed a peace prize to compensate one supposes for the dynamite he had made available The summons to a world conference issued by Czar Nicholas II who was behind in the arms race surpassed the wildest dreams of the friends of peace and sounded in the comment of a Viennese newspaper like beautiful music over the whole earth Once in the hands of governments  for no government could decline the summons  and of their delegations of tophatted diplomats and bemedaled military the results were carefully tailored to distress no war departments Nothing done at the Hague restrained the Balkan wars from breaking out within a year nor the explosion of world war six years later The battered nations that emerged from World War I made a serious effort toward world order in the establishment of the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice and they made a specific commitment to disarmament in the covenant of the League In Article 8 of the covenant recognized by the signatories as fundamental they argued that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety The Council of the League was mandated to formulate a plan of arms reduction for members to consider and act upon New undertakings to confirm and carry out this purpose were added by the Treaty of Locarno in 1925 The Committee on Disarmament worked for the next eight years in the attempt to implement Article 8 but agreement on means and principles broke down over the question of how to assure security before disarmament General security was recognized as a prerequisite to disarmament and sanctions against an aggressor as essential to security but no nation was prepared to trust in the system to the point of disarming Meanwhile the Washington Naval Conference of 1922 actually achieved the single act of arms control of the time not disarmament but a limitation of battleships by the United States Great Britain and Japan in the ratio of 553 and an agreement on nonfortification of the Pacific islands As the first such act by the great powers it was a stunning event supplemented by the NinePower Treaty guaranteeing the integrity of China Regrettably the soul was less handsome than the face Because Japan furiously resented holding the short end of the 553 ratio the effect of the treaties was ultimately negative Resentment fueled the rising Japanese militarism that led eventually to Pearl Harbor and the guarantee of Chinas integrity that Japan signed did not halt its program of expansion in China by so much as half an hour The Leagues efforts continued with the Geneva Protocol of 1924 for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes Intended to reaffirm and strengthen the covenant it provided for compulsory arbitration and defined the aggressor as the nation which refused arbitration As this made the parties nervous about sovereign rights the protocol was stillborn Optimism revived the next year with the Locarno Treaties which committed Germany and France to mutual guarantees of boundaries and committed Germany to pursue the course of arbitration in any disputes with Belgium France Poland or Czechoslovakia A euphoric Locarno spirit prevailed and bloomed in the forever memorable KelloggBriand Pact engaging its signatories in the renunciation of war The pact gained almost immediate and universal adherence because  according to one textbook that was either consciously or unconsciously cynical  the pact only involved renunciation of aggressive war and made no provision for sanctions In short it was empty Nevertheless the ceremonial signing in Paris was greeted by Foreign Minister Aristide Briand with genuine emotion as marking a new date in the history of mankind and by Secretary of State Frank Kelloggs happy assurance We have made peace at last The London Naval Conference of 1930 proved unable to translate this spirit into actual disarmament It registered some limitations on submarines and other tonnages amiably softened by an escalator clause which allowed an increase over specified tonnage if the national needs of any signatory demanded it The descent from euphoria was under way and was underlined a year later by the event that began the era of aggression and appeasement  Japans seizure of Manchuria In 1932 the Leagues efforts at arms control finally culminated in the major Disarmament Conference of 59 nations at Geneva It adjourned without result because Germany disarmed by the Treaty of Versailles was now admitted to the League and demanding equality which in turn caused France to cling rigidly to the principle that security must precede disarmament Later at a reconvened session in 1933 Britain France Germany and Italy signed a No Force Declaration pledging not in any circumstances to attempt to resolve any present or future differences between them by resort to force Though a fine promise it persuaded no one to disarm But let us not wax too cynical about the verbal promises They reflect what we genuinely wish and they keep the wish alive even if performance fails Humanitys eternal difficulty is that thought is never matched by practice Collective security now unraveled fast When the League adopted the Lytton Report blaming Japan as politely as possible for the Manchurian seizure Japan departed from Geneva and officially repudiated the naval agreements of 1922 and 1930 Germany left the League six months later denounced in its turn the Versailles Treaty and announced its own rearmament based on the failure of the other nations to disarm as provided by the Versailles Treaty and the League covenant As soon as its armed forces were sufficiently revived Germany repudiated the Locarno settlement with France and its troops reoccupied the Rhineland At the same time Italy invaded Ethiopia in a challenge that the League powers failed to meet by sanctions Collective security was moribund and Munich not far off After World War II the nations returned to the search for a system of international control Confronted by the atom bomb the United Nations tried through the International Atomic Energy Agency to lasso the new beast of war but all ropes fell short The United Nations Disarmament Commission earnestly plodding in the footsteps of its predecessor worked for five years to formulate a system for the limitation and balanced reduction of armed forces and armaments the elimination of major weapons of mass destruction and the effective control of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes It too adjourned in deadlock In 1959 a revised Commission of five Warsaw Pact and five NATO countries resumed the effort without success In 1961 the General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the use of nuclear weapons contrary to international law to the United Nations Charter and to the laws of humanity Comment fails Judging by the race in nuclear weapons since then resolutions of the General Assembly lack something in authority We come to 1962 the year of the Cuban missile crisis when 30 years after the Leagues Disarmament Conference the United Nations Disarmament Conference convened in Geneva over the graveyard of its ancestor with the declared aim of general and complete disarmament Seventeen nations with the notable exception of France  attended under the presidency of the United States and the Soviet Union and adjourned in the usual impasse Nevertheless in the waters off Cuba something had happened The shock of the near miss propelled the governments of the two parties to a serious effort at control Together with Great Britain they signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 renouncing nuclear tests above ground to which a hundred other signatories later adhered Hailed with solemn joy as a real advancement at last by the peace advocates who had worked so hard for it the test ban at least reduced radiation in the atmosphere That was a gain for the environment but not for disarmament It reduced no arsenals it simply drove the tests underground More tests have since been carried out underground than were previously carried out above ground The total since 1963 is 783 In 1980 alone there were 49 or the equivalent of four a month 20 by the Soviet Union 14 by the United States 11 by France three by England and one by China The Nonproliferation Treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1968 and since ratified by 116 nations is a similarly qualified accord It was meant to limit the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability Since the treaty that capability has been admittedly acquired by India probably acquired by Israel with Pakistan and South Africa said to be close behind Argentina Brazil and Iraq are said to be working hard on the development with South Korea and Taiwan possessing some degree of the technology Meanwhile the development of a defensive weapon the ABM or antiballistic missile threatened to upset  or as the strategists say destabilize  the system to the point of initiating a race to produce antiantiballistic missiles As detente was still warm or lukewarm the superpowers were sufficiently perturbed to enter strategic arms limitation talks and succeeded in 1972 in reaching the agreement called SALT I which actually accomplished some limitation It included a restrictive antiballisticmissile treaty and a socalled interim agreement temporarily freezing launchers of ICBMs and submarinelaunched missiles at existing levels The inexhaustible creativity of the weapons men however was not frozen and they soon raised lethal powers to a new stage As a result talks were renewed toward a more comprehensive mutual restraint but arms limitation travels on such reluctant feet that it took seven years of negotiations before a signed agreement was reached By that time relations had so deteriorated that SALT II never even reached a vote in the United States Senate It might be added that in 1972 a Biological Warfare Treaty prohibiting the development production and stockpiling of toxins and bacteriological weapons was signed by the United States Britain and the Soviet Union It entered into force in 1975 with a provision that any such weapons then in possession of the parties must be destroyed or diverted to peaceful purposes within nine months Yet substantial reports have circulated of a Soviet anthrax program that violates this treaty while the active chemical warfare recently reported in Afghanistan if true violates the Geneva Treaty of 1925 ratified by the Soviet Union in 1928 that prohibits belligerent use of chemical weapons Plainly there is nothing governments sign that they will not break I have engaged in this long and dreary survey in order to show that control of war in the form of disarmament or limitation of arms has been a fruitless effort Even the Encyclopaedia Britannica coming to that conclusion in its last edition was shaken from its usual composure to the outspoken admission that the effort for disarmament in our time has been spectacularly unsuccessful This suggests that we should try another way Control of nuclear war is too serious a matter to be left any longer to governments They are not going to get it for us in fact they are the obstacle As the late President Eisenhower recognized in that oftenquoted and very revealing remark People want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it What then is to be done What change can be expected in a process that has accomplished nothing in 80 years I think a change is possible because a new factor terrible as it may be has intervened it is the prospect of finality Before the advent of nuclear power war however devastating and brutal had limits of destruction The Mongols may have left pyramids of skulls and the Nazis the equivalent in their gas chambers but capacity was not global It is often supposed and stated that turning war against civilians is an introduction of our century but this is not so The medieval way to destroy an enemy was to destroy his resources by killing off as many as possible of his working class The punitive massacre of a citys inhabitants and the looting and burning of civilian property were normal procedures What our century has introduced is not new inhumanity but newly extended capacity for mass destruction and ruin of the human home Until now the finality of the human race and its living space was not within the framework of expectation Today it is which gives the question of control an urgency it never had before The new factor is fear It is fear that has given rise to the antinuclear movement in Europe and to the remarkable change in this country from the recent indifference to the new deep and widespread concern reflected in citizens committees bulletins and pamphlets church groups petitions demonstrations and conferences Last November a United States Senator David Pryor Democrat of Arkansas stated the case in a few words People are petrified to put it simply Fear may make the difference Heretofore we have ascribed war to human aggression to what William James called the rooted bellicosity of human nature A millennium of peace he maintained would not breed the fighting instinct out of our bone and marrow Maybe not but fear might It is the only motive power I believe that could compel us toward the control of war that all the efforts of the last 80 years have not secured It is an instrument moreover in the hands of the public Governments of course are made up of human beings who know fear no less than ordinary mortals But the trouble with governments is that they are moved by too many other considerations Policy makers become trapped in illusions of power individual ambition and selfimage vested interests ideologies hopes of reelection As a result fear has no room to energize common sense Governments I have concluded cannot be looked to for genuine disarmament or meaningful arms control Let us acknowledge it the American and Soviet Governments have no real desire to limit nuclear arms They go on talking about it as they are talking now at Geneva and this is useful up to a point because it keeps the dialogue going but the intention behind the talks is questionable Perhaps it is indicated on our side by the appointment as chief delegate to the Geneva talks of the high priest of the hard line Paul Nitze A rough equivalent would be putting Pope John Paul II in charge of abortion rights Governments that distrust each other do not seriously intend to reduce their arsenals That is understandable but we should understand it and not expect much Governments like the rest of us know that in a conflict of nuclear powers there can be no hard dividing line between conventional and nuclear warfare One will slide inevitably into the other as soon as the choice for one side becomes either escalation or surrender And they know that nuclear war once started cannot be limited because the side that is losing will employ whatever remains in its silos Strategists nevertheless talk of limited war but I expect that is to let them sleep at night  besides providing the material for a large and growing profession They plan scenarios play deterrence juggle the acronyms calculate delivery accuracy and counterforce capability expound preemptive strike versus worst case and intricately occupy their minds and skills in a way they could not if they acknowledged that the operation must end in a big bang While they keep busy the obstacle to progress is that the superpowers have got themselves into such a bind of mutual suspicion that they cannot divest themselves of a single missile That will take a revolutionary change of attitude The principle necessary for such a change was stated by MadariagaSumming up his experience as the general manager of disarmament he wrote in his memoirs that the causes of quarrel must be eliminated first before disarmament can take place The trouble with disarmament he wrote in 1973 was and still is that the problem of war is tackled upside down and at the wrong end  Nations dont distrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they distrust each other And therefore to want disarmament before a minimum of common agreement on fundamentals is as absurd as to want people to go undressed in winter Let the weather be warm and people will discard their clothes readily and without committees to tell them how to undress I realize that the metaphoric warm weather is a long way off but a minimum of common agreement on fundamentals is the essence That is going to have to be our almost impossible task If the nuclear threat is to be taken as seriously as all the passionate words of the peace advocates plead we have no choice but to implement the Madariaga theorem While I do not wish to get into politics because the problem is deeper than that the first step may have to be recourse to Horace Greeleys slogan Turn the rascals out The Reagan Administration is explicitly and probably immovably attached to a policy of bigger and better and more arms not less To quote the Republican national platform of 1980 the partys object is to close the gaps with the Soviets and ultimately reach the position of military superiority that the American people demand This is nonsense even more than is normal for an electoral platform I do not know whether the American people demand military superiority or not but I know that for now and the foreseeable future it is an illusion and delusion If there is a gap how is it measured How do we know when we have closed it The advocates of increase say it is measured by relative expenditures but you might as well judge a beauty contest by what the contestants spend at the hairdresser Expenditure does not tell you the quality or effectiveness of what it buys nor the combat efficiency or commitment of those who operate the weapons Military superiority is not a tangible nor a static thing one can get or keep If we got it it might last a week For the sake of clutching at this cloud the Administration insists upon a defense expenditure that is ultimately counterproductive because the cost will gradually erode civilian support for the defense program Creating an unmanageable deficit and adding 50 billion each year to the national debt is the greatest cause of the inflation that is wrecking the economy and the welfare of our society Americans may not be the most rational of people but eventually enough of them will put two and two together to demand a halt I cannot speak for the Soviet people from personal knowledge but I should think it unlikely that they exist in serenity A study made in 1981 by the International Communication Agency the former United States Information Agency reports that while the Russians apparently do not fear direct attack they suffer their own kind of apprehension about the United States as a power that can overwhelm them by superior military technology In the popular view the United States is seen as capable of changing the military balance in its favor overnight by some technological miracle that will leave the Soviet Union far behind in the arms race Soviet governing groups according to the study harbor doubts about the competence reliability and effectiveness of their own forces The possibility of direct conflict with the United States is no longer dismissed out of hand as it was formerly although the Chinese rather than ourselves are seen as the enemy and the sense of inevitable conflict with China is pervasive Add to this the absence of selfsufficiency in food the running sore of Afghanistan the shift in their own population toward a possible majority of nonRussian peoples and a border of unreliable satellite nations and the sum is reason enough for uneasiness I do not share however the idea that the Russians might at some desperate moment plunge into foreign war to drown their internal dangers that seems unlikely American theory holds that they would like to dominate by blackmailing the United States with their superior forces nuclear and conventional and therefore we must deploy greater forces lest we be dominated If Soviet conventional forces started to roll across Europe we are told NATO conventional forces could not successfully oppose them and therefore we would have to resort to nuclear weapons first tactical and then inevitably when the enemy replied in kind intercontinental landbased or submarinebased missiles On the other hand I have heard it said that no American President would ever give the order to let loose nuclear war meaning presumably that we would prefer to accept Soviet domination or else on the assumption that the Russians too refrain from loosing their missiles that we would reach a kind of standoff much as we have now Given nuclear weapons and their consequences one thing is clear There is no military solution to the problem The confrontation of their system and ours has I repeat no military solution I noticed that one of the Congressmen who went to El Salvador last February to investigate the situation recognized this in the microcosm of that struggle I dont think Representative James K Coyne Republican of Pennsylvania was quoted as saying we can develop a military solution That was astute and as Coynes Law could justifiably be extrapolated to cover the larger rivalry of the United States versus the Soviet Union Whatever the strategists and militarists and presentdanger propagandists have to say about warfighting as they oddly like to call it there is no war of nuclear powers now that can be won or could end short of extinction Earl Mountbatten citing his 50 years of military service told the public shortly before he was killed in 1979 that the nuclear arms race has no military purpose Wars cannot be fought with nuclear weapons That they must have the weapons anyway is the position of the Soviet and American Governments This policy can only be deactivated I think by public rejection There can be no real progress toward arms control until public tolerance of existing policy ends When public tolerance stops piling up overkill must stop because as Christoph Bertram the director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies recently acknowledged without acceptance by the public there can be no sustainable policy The European antinuclear movement has already shown that governments and parliaments respond to public pressure if for no other reason than fear of losing the next election The deepest emotion of any person in high office is desire to stay in The public wish not to be obliterated and not to be despoiled by grotesque military spending and insane national debt must make itself effectively felt Military needs must be brought into proportion with the other needs of society social and cultural When control of arms becomes a goal of the mainstream then it will prevail The working instrument is votes Every candidate for elective office this coming November should be asked to state for the record his position on the arms race I am not deluded enough to suppose that reason will suddenly take possession of the human race and that a majority of every community will see the light of common sense within the next six months I am a historian not a mystic Nor am I a Maoist believer in the ultimate wisdom of the people Your people said Alexander Hamilton unkindly to Thomas Jefferson is nothing but a great beast but even a beast may balk at the edge of an abyss Public demand should continue for a bilateral nuclear freeze ratification of SALT II a ban on all nuclear testing and above all for a firm renunciation of first strike by act of Congress These are necessary both to inform the public and maintain the pressure Dramatizing the issue is Ambassador George F Kennans proposal for a sweeping 50 percent bilateral reduction of all nuclear arms without further discussion to be followed by a further reduction of twothirds of what remained This cuts through the rhetoric and notifies us all how serious is a serious mans estimate of the situation Yet with all due respect to Ambassador Kennan something else must happen first I come back to the Madariaga theorem The source of hostility must be eliminated or mitigated before nations will give up their weapons Most people would say that to eliminate hostility between Communism and free enterprise is impossible I will grant that it is very difficult but not more so than disarmament which has eluded our efforts so far therefore we might just as well try another way If all the energies skills intelligence and at least half the money we have put to the use of the arms program were employed instead in an effort to reach accommodation or modus vivendi that is to say a way of living not dying  we might in fact find it This does not mean we have to be friends Friendship between a representative government based on liberty of the individual and a totalitarian government based on submission of the individual to the state can never be natural We are not on a common path we do not have political methods and principles in common we share only one common goal  survival As long ago as 1957 the late Gen Omar Bradley saw this as the path He asked why we do not make greater more diligent more imaginative use of reason and human intelligence in seeking an accord and a compromise which will make it possible for mankind to control the atom and banish it as an instrument of war  It may be that the problems of accommodation in a world split by rival ideologies are more difficult than those with which we have struggled in the construction of ballistic missiles But I believe that if we apply to these human problems the energy creativity and perseverance we have devoted to science even problems of accommodation will yield to reason That is such a brave belief that I could not resist quoting it Instinctively I share it although I know from the study of history that reason does not control human motivation Still there are measures we might try One would be a more massive more purposeful effort than may now be conducted to promote antinuclear sentiment and fear of their own policies among the people of the Soviet Union and satellite countries We are always blaming the Russians for agitating the peace movement in Western Europe Why should we not do the same behind the Iron Curtain We could also try what might be called the stuffedgoose option  that is providing them with all the grain and consumer goods they need in such quantities that they become dependent on us and could not risk the domestic turbulence that would follow if they cut off the source of supply by war Mistrust has to be tackled and that is the hardest task Diplomats and journalists who have dealt with Soviet officials see small chance of breaking through the granite wall of their recalcitrance Yet living as we do now under a cloud of imminent explosion is too expensive and too socially destructive We must find the way to coexistence without violence If Germans and French after centuries of hostility and three major wars in the last hundred years could do just that from sheer necessity I suppose we could too This is easily said but it is a deeper more basic enterprise requiring more radical readjustment of national thinking than another round of balancing your missiles against my missiles A start might be made if leaders came to power in Washington and Moscow at the same time who both really wanted accommodation Only both publics can make that happen
THE FAILED MISSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/magazine/the-failed-mission.html,It has been almost two years since the bold ambitious attempt to rescue the American hostages in Teheran collapsed in flames on a bleak stretch of Iranian desert Here in the first account by a key participant Zbigniew Brzezinski President Carters national security adviser tells of the months of secret planning meticulous preparation and spirited debate that led to the rescue attempt Although the details of the mission have been examined in this magazine and elsewhere a number of new facts and insights emerge from Dr Brzezinskis account which is based on his recollections and a journal he kept during the 14month hostage crisis They include the following One day before the raid the President rejected a plan that cloaked the rescue attempt in a larger punitive military assault on Iran designed to help salvage the national prestige if the rescue failed The military was instructed to stage a collision with a Russian ship if necessary to prevent detection of the mission Carter considered a plan to seize some of the Iranian captors as counterhostages but ultimately authorized holding them only until the planned takeoff from Iran Carters deep personal concern about inflicting casualties was a constant element in the planning of the mission he directed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to make it his personal responsibility to see that no wanton killings resulted from the raid A critical weakness in the rescue plan  the insufficient number of helicopters  was raised by a senior military officer in a whispered aside at a key White House meeting shortly before the mission Preparations for the raid included an advance onsite intelligence probe to locate an appropriate place in the desert to land aircraft Reading the Brzezinski account today it is important to remember the political and emotional backdrop against which the drama was played As efforts at negotiations with the Iranians foundered and months passed the 1980 Presidential primaries continued with the incumbent facing a stubborn challenge from within his own partyPublic pressure on the Administration to do something  almost anything  to break the stalemate was mounting Television commentators were adding to the tension by ticking off the days of captivity with each nightly broadcast Within the Administration the strains between the White House and the State Department had reached the breaking point and the rescue attempt ultimately led to the resignation of the Secretary of State Cyrus R Vance In the midst of all this was Brzezinski the strongwilled Polishborn hardliner whose task was to coordinate and synthesize the different views of the Departments of State and Defense and the CIA and present them to the President As this account reveals the professorturnedadviser had strong views of his own about how and when the rescue should be mounted Though more than five months passed from the day our people were taken hostage in Teheran until the final decision was made to try to free them planning for a rescue attempt began almost immediately Just two days after the seizure of our embassy on Nov 4 1979 the process was set in motion when I telephoned Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and instructed him to have the Joint Chiefs of Staff develop a plan for a rescue mission My thought was that we needed such a contingency scheme in the event that some of the hostages were either put on trial and then sentenced to death or were simply murdered by their kidnappers at the time these seemed to be lively possibilities A rescue mission would then have been a moral as well as a political obligation both to our people imprisoned in Iran as well as to our national honor The military came back to me two days later  on Nov 8  with a briefing in the Situation Room in the White House At this meeting we carefully reviewed aerial photographs and examined the schedule for a possible airborne helicopter assault on the embassy compound by a specially trained team The plan called for the rescue team and the hostages to be extricated from an airfield not too far from Teheran We had two problems inadequate intelligence regarding the disposition of the hostages and the enormously complex problem of logistics Our target was far from the United States remote from any Americancontrolled facilities and helicopters were not usually used for longdistance assault missions The military went to work overcoming these difficulties and on Nov 11 I went to the Pentagon for a much more comprehensive review of how the mission might be executed It was here that I started to consider for the first time that there might be a need to combine the rescue mission with a retaliatory strike designed to inflict damage on Iran but with precautions to avoid largescale civilian casualties Retaliatory plans were being developed in any case because we had to consider the possibility that the hostages would be killed and that a purely punitive action would have to be undertaken My thought was to link one of such punitive scenarios with the rescue mission thereby giving our military operation a broader character The rescue mission would then be simply one of its components The purpose of such a combination would be to prevent the continued humiliation of the United States in the event of a massive failure of the rescue mission My view was that casualties in the rescue mission would be unavoidable but we also had to face the possibility that the attempt might fail altogether If the rescue succeeded that would be all to the good if it failed the United States Government could announce that it had executed a punitive mission against Iran because of its unwillingness to release our people and that unfortunately in the course of that mission an attempt to rescue the hostages had not succeeded I mention this point now because it became the subject of more intense debate later when the rescue mission was finally approved It should be made clear in this context that my concern over the failure of the mission did not pertain to something like what finally happened  its early abortion  but rather to some totally unexpected setback during its execution in Teheran involving heavy casualties for the team for the hostages or for both Our expectation was that the probability of such a setback was relatively low but we could certainly not exclude it entirely At this stage in developing options for Presidential decision I felt that the rescue mission should be a lastresort action to be undertaken only if the hostages were being killed or were about to be killed I was leaning more toward a generalized military response designed to put Iran under pressure to release our hostages The actions that made most sense to me involved seizing Kharg Island Irans main oilexport facility and imposing a naval blockade possibly combined with some air strikes However after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late December 1979 I concluded that such a military action would be strategically damaging to the United States since it would simply give additional opportunities to the Russians in their drive toward the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean It now seemed to me more important to forge an antiSoviet Islamic coalition and military action by us against Iran would have been counterproductive to such an effort It was in this context that the rescue mission started to look more attractive to me especially as the negotiating tack gradually came to prove fruitless hroughout this period a small group composed of Secretary Brown Gen David C Jones Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm Stansfield Turner Director of Central Intelligence and one or two of our immediate associates would meet regularly in my office with me taking handwritten notes of the proceedings We were planning both a possible rescue mission and wider military action These meetings were held in such secrecy that even my close staff was unaware of them and of the plans for the rescue My gravest concern was that any rescue mission would have to be assured maximum secrecy and surprise and I feared that the pattern of massive leakage in the United States Government the endless multiplication of papers the rather loose enforcement of the principle of access as well as the unavoidable penetration by hostile agents would compromise our mission I was haunted by the fear that at the critical juncture the Iranians would be warned probably by the Soviet Union and the mission would be destroyedI noted in my journal in late February that pressure from the public and from Congress for more direct action against Iran was building On Feb 28 1980 I met with a group of some 40 Congressmen and I reported on my return to the White House their growing frustration over the absence of any progress in the negotiations I raised with the President the rescue option and asked him to authorize a flight into Iran to examine firsthand the possible landing site for the mission The President declined to do so out of concern that such a probe might fail and thereby jeopardize the negotiating process Knowing that Secretary of State Cyrus R Vance was not enthusiastic about any rescue mission I talked to him early in March and obtained his agreement that an intelligence probe would in any case be useful I knew that the President would be more impressed by such a joint recommendation I went back to the President on March 7 and again he reserved his decision on the same grounds  that he did not want to endanger the negotiations The rescue issue however was becoming more urgent From a practical point of view the success of the mission depended on nighttime being sufficiently long to provide cover for the complicated process of deep penetration into Irans air space A very comprehensive review of the rescue plan by Brown Jones and myself in midMarch led me to the conclusion that the plan had a reasonably good chance of success though there probably would be casualties How large they might be was impossible to estimate and much depended on the degree to which the mission would enjoy the advantages of surprise and secrecy At this stage I also informed both Jody Powell the press secretary and Hamilton Jordan the Presidents aide of some of the details of the rescue mission I discussed it more fully with Vice President Walter F Mondale All three were feeling increasingly frustrated and concerned about rising public pressure for more direct action against Iran We were faced essentially with three choices We could continue negotiating ad infinitum even though the Iranians gave no indication of their willingness or ability to make any accommodation raising the prospect of our having eventually to accept humiliating conditions we could undertake a large primarily punitive military operation against Iran with the likelihood that the Iranians would respond by doing something brutal or murderous to the hostages and that they might even invite the Soviet Union to provide military assistance or finally we could undertake the admittedly risky but increasingly feasible rescue mission With the political climate heating up and with our political opponents deliberately exploiting the hostage issue to embarrass President Carter public pressure on behalf of the second option was clearly on the rise Our freedom of choice and our ability to act responsibly were certainly not helped by the daily invocations by wellknown television commentators on the number of days our hostages had been incarcerated Yet at the same time it was evident to us that a general military operation was perhaps the worst solution of all It would not free the hostages and it could tip the strategic balance in this vital region in favor of the Soviet Union by generating unprecedented IranianSoviet military and political collaboration Thus the choice increasingly was between endless negotiations or the more surgical solution provided by the rescue mission Perhaps surprisingly there was never any explicit discussion of the relationship between what we might have to do in Iran and domestic politics neither the President nor his political advisers ever discussed with me the question of whether one or another of our Iranian options would have a better or a worse domestic political effect For my part I was conscious throughout that at stake were not only lives but our national honor and our strategic interests I felt it was my duty to be concerned at least as much about the latter two as about the first It was for this reason and I hope I will not be misunderstood in saying it that I decided not to meet with the families of the hostages I felt that I should not be swayed by unavoidable human emotions but that I should be free to take into account all of the factors that a decision maker in some degree responsible for the national security of this country ought to consider I was determined to do all I could to get the hostages out for I felt as deeply for them as anyone else in the Administration but I also believed strongly that the conditions of a release or settlement could be of importance to our international standing and to the preservation of our national security With the passage of time we were all becoming more confident that possible kinks were being worked out of the rescue plan and that the probability of success was increasing with additional refinements to it not the least of which was improved intelligence The rescue option began to take on a kind of inevitability at a crucial meeting on March 22 when the President heard his first full briefing on the mission While both Brown and I had been deeply immersed in the rescue plan it had not become a prime alternative as a national policy decision That Saturday Carter and his key advisers  Vance Mondale Brown Turner Jones Powell my deputy David Aaron and myself  met at Camp David It was a terribly windy day and the helicopter ride from Washington was rocky but Mondale Brown and I became so engrossed in a discussion of our political prospects that we actually recalled the flight as having been smooth  As is customary at Camp David we ere all dressed casually  jeans sport jackets or sweaters The conference table in the central cabin is unusually large so there is much more distance between participants than in the Cabinet Room in the White House and one tends to lounge more to lean back and even to put ones feet on the edge of the table There is on the surface an impression of airiness relaxation and informality at Camp David  After we entered the study Carter called Brown I stood in front of the desk with my mind racing Should I press the President to go ahead with only five helicopters Here I was alone with the President able perhaps to persuade him to abandon military prudence to opt for a daring single stroke for the big prize to take the historic chance And at the same time a contradictory thought flashed through my mind Would I not be abusing my office by pressing this man into such a quick decision after months of meticulous planning The President reached Brown at 455 PM I crouched in front of his desk so that I could take notes on it while they spoke Carter asked for the latest report and Brown presumably reported what he had said to me I whispered to the President having resolved in my own mind how to act You should get the opinion of the commander in the field His attitude should be taken into account I had decided to urge going ahead with five helicopters only if Colonel Beckwith was prepared to do it The President asked Brown for the field commanders assessment and then I heard the President say Lets go with his recommendation He put down the phone looked at me and confirmed that the mission was aborted He then put his head in his arms and cradled it on his desk for a few seconds I felt extraordinarily sad for him as well as for the country Neither of us said anything The President then asked me to convene a meeting of all his principal advisers and the rest of the day was spent informing the various governments of what had happened and coordinating the extrication of our men When we assembled in the Cabinet Room I was struck not only by how lined everyones face was and I assume mine was as well but also by how calm and lowkey the atmosphere was There were no recriminations raised voices  not even much tension Carter was particularly controlled and businesslike though he must have realized what a personal as well as political calamity he had just suffered At 515 PM the President received a call from General Jones who reported that one of the helicopters had run into a C130 and burst into flames and that there were casualties Carter looked as if someone had stabbed him pain was evident all over his face but he remained very cool and in complete control of the meeting He instructed Vance Christopher and Powell to begin preparing a public statement on the failure of the mission We were joined shortly by Turner who urged that no public statement be made until he had made certain that his people in Iran were safe I admired the way Turner fought for his agents and we agreed to delay any public announcement until 1 AM Although we knew shortly after 6 PM that there were fatalities at Desert One it was not until approximately 11 PM that we learned eight men had sacrificed their lives so that other Americans would go free and so that Americas honor would be redeemed They were the real heroes of this tragic day The next morning Harold Brown gave a superb briefing to the press explaining in cool and precise terms how the operation was planned how it was executed up to the stage when it was aborted and what had gone wrong Since the mission was aborted at an early stage I did not raise the question of any concurrent retaliatory action Such a move would only have given the aroused and emotionally unstable Iranians an opportunity to take revenge on our hostages On the morning of April 26 I convened a meeting in my office on the instruction of the President to plan another rescue mission While we did not know at this stage what precisely had gone wrong  beyond the fact that two helicopters had malfunctioned and that a helicopter and a C130 had collided at Desert One  we decided initially to make the second attempt simpler one in which a larger force would be airlifted right into Teheran and a nearby airfield seized Any effort to attempt such a rescue would have to await the outcome of renewed diplomatic initiatives as well as the reassembly of the hostages who in the meantime had been dispersed throughout Iran I also met with the commanders of the operation and verified that they had all concurred in the aborting of the mission once they were down to five helicopters This greatly relieved me for I had continued to worry that perhaps we should have gone ahead adjusting our plans under fire so to speak Needless to say the failure was the most bitter disappointment of my four years in the White House Could we have done it differently Should we have tried sooner Should we not have tried at all These questions are not easy to answer even with the benefit of hindsight Carter perhaps would have improved his political fortunes by having been more willing to toy with or even to sacrifice the lives of the hostages  and this he refused to do by any peremptory and demagogically appealing actions The political costs of failure might have been smaller if we had tried the rescue mission sooner but we felt that we had to give the negotiations a chance to succeed For my part I felt we had to exhaust the negotiating track and that the Administration had to be almost united in the view that the rescue mission was timely before we actually undertook it  for otherwise any failure would be demoralizing and profoundly divisive The rescue mission paradoxically did have one immediate benefit It relieved public pressure for a largescale American military action against Iran and thus permitted the resumption of our diplomatic efforts reinforced by sanctions to obtain the release of our people Personally I never had any political or moral regrets about the rescue mission I felt that we owed it to all concerned to try to rescue our people once there was a good chance of success At the time the likely alternative seemed to be either their prolonged incarceration or their murder by the Iranians My greatest worry was that we would not succeed in preserving secrecy and in achieving surprise Little did I dream that our failure would involve technology an area where America normally excels I knew throughout that there were risks involved but that was unavoidable I felt then as I feel now that not to have tried while having the capacity to try would have been shameful and unworthy of AmericaTERENCE SMITHEVE THERE IS AN INTRO TO THIS WHOLE BRZEZINSKI MESS WRITTEN BY TERRY SMITH WHICH IS NOT YET IN FINAL SHAPE COPYRIGHT c 1982 BY ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKIZbigniew

CONNECTICUT JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/nyregion/connecticut-journal.html,WHEN Governor ONeill called a press conference for last Monday afternoon reporters looked forward to the event with special anticipation It wasnt because there was a burning topic to discuss in fact the press conference had not been called for any particular reason And it wasnt because this was to be an open askwhateveryouwant press conference although this was Mr ONeills first such event since taking office 14 months ago The interest in seeing Mr ONeill step behind the lectern was the lectern itself The Governor while experienced in public speaking has an aversion to crowds of microphones waving in his face When broadcast reporters set microphones on his desk he tries to push them back to leave himself a few inches of clear space The reporters however say they get better quality recordings by keeping the microphones close Recently therefore the Governor asked that a new lectern be built and on Monday it was unveiled The wooden structure with the state seal on the front is of standard width but it is unusually long about two feet long The top is as usual slightly inclined toward the speaker but the special part of the lectern is the sides A stubby winglike shelf sprouts from each side leaving space for a cluster of microphones It looks only moderately like a standard lectern Governor ONeill in fact gave it a careful examination as he entered the office where reporters had gathered for the press conference I dont know what this is called he said the Battleship Galactica Mr ONeill who is running for a term in his own right said that the lectern and he would appear more frequently in coming weeks Connecticuts campaign to diversify its economy is paying off in its first real test the current recession according to the states Department of Economic Development The state finished 1981 with an unemployment rate lower than that of 36 other states according to John J Carson the Economic Development Commissioner The 62 percent unemployment figure was one percentage point below the national average he pointed out and half Michigans rate In comparison during the last recession in the mid70s Connecticuts unemployment rate exceeded the national average The 1981 figures show that the states with lower unemployment figures than Connecticuts are predominantly agriculturebased For the current year unemployment is still rising but Connecticuts unemployment figure for February was two percentage points below the national average of 88 percent the department said Businesses labor unions professional groups and many others with common interests have formed an increasing number of political action committees in recent years to channel campaign contributions to political candidates sharing their points of view Last week a new political action committee was formed in Connecticut to back candidates supporting womens issues in this years elections for the state legislature The announcement of the Womens Issues Network Political Action Committee  known as WINPAC  was made at a fundraising event at the home of United States Representative Barbara B Kennelly Democrat of Hartford It is past time that women increase their involvement in electoral politics where it counts  in the financial commitment to campaigns said Flora Parisky head of WINPAC The criteria for backing candidates will depend on their record of support for such issues as economic equality for women elimination of racism elimination of violence against women nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and freedom to choose abortion according to the announcement Connecticut Public Television will have a house to help balance its budget after all Last year a builder gave the publictelevision organization a house in Rocky Hill which was sold during CPTVs annual fundraising auction This year CPTV is struggling to raise more money in its auction which began last week because of a cut in its Federal subsidy But it thought that it would have to do so without a house to sell In what may become a tradition however CPTV was given another house this time by the Insilco Corporation of Meriden We feel it is incumbent upon business and the private sector to take up the slack by providing extra support for public television said Donald J Harper president of Insilco The ranchstyle house at 32 Cliffside Drive Wallingford has three bedrooms two baths a twocar garage extra insulation and as may be of interest to auction viewers is wired for cable television CPTV puts the value of the house at 120000 Like every other realestate seller the organization is trying to set up an attractive financing package Governor ONeill had the decidely welcome task Thursday of announcing what he called a magnificent gift to the state that had a somewhat complicated and historical significance for Connecticut The announcement came on taxdeadline day which was appropriate since the gift can in effect be multiplied threefold thanks to some Federal tax laws that probably few people have heard about The gift to the state was 1977 acres of undeveloped woodland in Harwinton some 10 miles east of Litchfield The land will become one of the largest wildlife management areas in the state and will be open to the public for hunting fishing hiking and other recreation in one of the most scenic spots in the state The land had been acquired in the early part of the century by the late J Henry Roraback a powerful state Republican leader and utilities developer Mr Roraback left the land to his son Lewis who established a land trust transferr ing the site to the state after his death Lewis Roraback died several months ago While the land is an outright gift to the state it is valued at 3475000 which is where the littleknown Federal tax laws benefit of the state In the late 1930s Congress passed the PittmanRobertson Act which taxed sales on sporting guns ammunition and related equiptment In the 1950s the DingallJohnson Act provided for a Federal tax on fishing gear As a conservation method the sport taxes were to be used to provide funds to the states to buy land for wildlife amd recreational use The amount of the Federal funding for the state was set so that the Government would give three times the value of private gifts to the state of wildlife areas Thus the gift of the Roraback land makes the state eligible for 10425000 in Federal funds to buy additional wildlife areas The state knows exactly what land it wants and is now in the process of closing a deal The land to be purchased is 417 acres of prime land in Westbrook about five miles east of Old Saybrook The package includes six miles of riverfront that is expected to provide recreational trout fishing a 15acre pond and what is considered to be one of the best examples in the state of a late 19thcentury manufacturing plant The entire property has been in the Messerchmidt family for some 70 years The Messerchmidts came to this country from Germany in 1902 and eventually moved to Connecticut They settled in Westbrook where the family still resides Rather than sell the land to private developers the family is selling it at market value to the state The purchase price will be announced when the closing takes place State environmental officials who will administer the two properties in opposite corners of the state were delighted with the gift and the pending purchase It is a real boon to recreational and especially wildlife management programs in this state said Alphonse Letendre a state land agent Governor ONeill said These valuable acquisitions offer the opportunity to preserve two excellent pieces of property as wildlife recreational areas for the benefit of future generations There was a respite last Wednesday from all the discordant notes that have been echoing around the State Capitol as both houses of the General Assembly work through long calendars of pending bills For a few brief moments the sounds of the Hartford Symphony Brass Quintet could be heard from the Hall of Flags instead of the usual blare of the Capitol loudspeakers summoning legislators to caucuses sessions or rollcall votes The guest performance was held to announce a new statewide concert series to be sponsored by members of Local 919 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union The series which will start next month will bring musictogo ensembles of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra to an estimated 100000 people in schools libraries and other public places across the state Representative David Lavine Democrat of Durham and chairman of the legislatures ad hoc committee on the arts said he was pleased to have the group in the Capitol bringing music and pleasure to the legislative halls

Washington Watch; Money-Short Tax Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/19/business/washington-watch-money-short-tax-court.html,WASHINGTON THERE really wasnt anything else we could do said Charles S Casazza chief clerk of the United States Tax Court describing efforts to save a little money by canceling all trial sessions for April and the first week in May The cases involving several thousand taxpayers whose simmering disputes with the Internal Revenue Service have brought them to the court have been rescheduled for July provided Congress comes up with 15 million of supplemental appropriations Otherwise warned Mr Casazza the court which employs 230 persons including 29 judges will simply run out of money during the summer We cant close down the court the chief clerk contended seeking to muster some confidence in the appropriations process The public wont let us He is still fending off the slings and arrows of some litigants who were counting on a July vacation The judges travel to 100 cities and towns a year to hear taxpayers their lawyers and the IRS lawyers argue about questionable charitable contributions inventive tax shelters tricky depreciation allowances and the other esoterica of tax law In April and the first week of May they were scheduled to hold sessions in New York Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle Salt Lake City Phoenix Columbia SC Tampa Fla San Diego Miami Philadelphia and Chicago Meanwhile swing sessions were to be held in dozens of smaller towns in the southwest midAtlantic and New England regions By keeping the judges in Washington the court saves on transportation and reporting costs hoping that Congress will come up with the funds Some 30000 cases were filed before the tribunal last year and it has a current backlog of 47000 cases Congressional staff aides said that the court has been caught unintentionally in the budget battle jurisdictional fights between committees and a fight over a controversial antiabortion amendment The court is one of several bodies financed through the Treasury Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Bill When that bill failed to clear last year because of the antiabortion amendment monies came from a continuing resolution that trimmed 16 percent from the fiscal 1982 budgets A supplemental appropriations bill has been readied to ride to the rescue and Congressional staffers expect it to pass but just when is unclear because there are still some contests to be resolved between committees and between House and Senate GAO Criticizes IRS While taxpayers may have temporarily lost their right of appeal the General Accounting Office the investigative arm of Congress marked the April 15 tax deadline with a study that trounces some of the working methods of the IRS The report commissioned by Senator Lloyd Bentsen Democrat of Texas says that the Revenue Service accounts for 50 percent of the 13 billion hours of paperwork that the Federal Government imposes annually on the American public And it adds that by adopting some new management procedures the service could reduce this burden by some 45 million hours and lower its own operating costs by more than 1 million almost immediately The report suggests that the IRS should reduce nonessential detail on Schedule F of Form 1040 Farm Income and Expenses and on Form 4835 Farm Rental Income and Expenses and Summary of Gross Income From Farming and Fishing and that it should allow certain taxpayers to bypass Schedule E of Form 1040 Supplemental Income Schedule In addition the Congressional watchdogs contend that further taxpayer hours could be saved by adopting an 1120 US Corporation Income Tax Return Short Form and by eliminating duplication on Form 5884 Jobs Credit and Schedule K1 of Form 1041 Beneficairys Share of Income Deduction Credits Etc The revenue service was also urged to strengthen its internal controls over the development and revision of tax forms perform practical utility reviews to assure that collected information is needed and used improve clarity and consistency of forms and instructions and involve top management more in the process of developing forms The IRS now inundated by returns from 95 million Americans had no immediate comment on the report Wine vs Corn Gluten The Administration is now debating what measures to take in retaliation if the European Economic Community actually imposes a threatened import tax on corn gluten American farmers sold 500 million worth of this livestock feed to the Europeans last year French Italian German and Luxembourg wines are on at least one retaliatory hit list An average bottle of French wine could go up by 50 cents to 1 under tariff increases now being considered View From Harvard Kenneth R Andrews is editor of the Harvard Business Review and chairman of the General Management Faculty at the Harvard Business School He told the National Economists Club last week that people along the Charles are saying some unkind things about the people along the Potomac Everybody I hear talking in Cambridge seems to believe that the implicit national industrial policy currently embodied in our present tax regulatory and antitrust policies is chaotic inconsistent and obsolete
BIRTH CONTROL: 4-DAY PILL IS PROMISING IN EARLY TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/20/science/birth-control-4-day-pill-is-promising-in-early-test.html,A new birth control pill which women could take for four days at the end of each monthly cycle instead of for three weeks as at present has been devised by a leading French biochemist Prof EtienneEmile Baulieu announced his device and the results of preliminary tests in his speech of induction today to Frances highest scientific body the Academy of Sciences Although Dr Baulieus work has been closely held word of it has begun to arouse interest among several leading specialists in the United States and elsewhere Dr Baulieus invention is a steroid whose effect he says is to jam the protein receptor through which the cells of the uterus are able to absorb progesterone Progesterone prepares the uterine cells to accept lodge and sustain the fertilized ovum Taking the steroid in pill form for four days beginning two days before the expected onset of menstruation diverts progesterone from the uterine cells If a fertilized egg has been implanted it is dislodged producing according to Professor Baulieu the bleeding and cramps typical of a natural abortion of less than a months pregnancy If there is no pregnancy the steroid simply assures a moreorless normal menstruation he finds In an interview over the weekend at the Bicetre Hospital a leading teaching institution whose hormone laboratory he heads Dr Baulieu said he believed that his discovery is a real breakthrough in the control of fertility He said an intensive animal toxicity testing program by RousselUclaf the leading French chemical company engaged in steroid research had indicated that the pill was safe But more testing will have to be done The primary research on humans thus far has involved 11 women who were known to be pregnant and thus the drug was being used to abort an established pregnancy rather than as a monthly treatment whether a woman has conceived or not The study was conducted by Dr Walter Herrman director of the Human Reproduction Department at the Cantonal Hospital in Geneva and an internationallyknown gynecological expert The volunteers most of them nurses or medical students and ranging from 18 to 24 years in age were six to eight weeks pregnant All had requested abortions They were given 200 milligrams of the steroid  which bears the name RU486 but whose composition is held secret by Dr Baulieu and RousselUclaf who hope to produce it commercially  each day for four days In nine cases bleeding began within two days in the two others it began later and was slight In eight cases the embryo was expelled in two to five days although in one woman aspiration was used to cut the process short because of heavy bleeding A ninth case took eight days and in the two failures aspiration was used to end the pregnancy Dr Baulieu believes that the two failures resulted from insufficient knowledge of proper dosage something he says that wider use and testing could remedy He stresses however that in all the cases  including that of the heavy bleeding  the process and side effects closely approximated those of a natural abortion more closely than with other types of induced abortion Dr Baulieu believes that the most promising aspect of RU486 is not to induce abortion once pregnancy is recognized but to be used regularly to terminate any pregnancy that may have occurred In a second experiment undertaken at the Geneva hospital three women not believed to be pregnant since they were using intrauterine devices were given one quarter of the dosage for four days beginning on the 22d day of the menstrual cycle Bleeding occurred 48 hours after the beginning continuing like a period of normal menses but slightly more abundant than usual Dr Baulieus paper said The following cycle pursued its normal course with ovulation and no secondary effect was observed The study showed that the pill could induce a normal menstrual period two days after treatment is begun Dr Baulieus term for his steroid is menses regulator In other words taken monthly it would regulate the menstrual cycle where there was no pregnancy and extirpate the pregnancy where there was one Dr Baulieu is not noticeably tentative about his conclusions or his hopes but he acknowledges that a great deal more testing must be done For one thing he says although he sees no sign that the method will produce undesirable side effects and every sign that it will not only wider testing can confirm this For another the exact regulation of dosages to conform with age physical condition and other factors can only develop with extensive clinical usage Interest has been expressed he said both by the World Health Organization and by the Population Council at the Rockefeller Foundation He hopes that once Governmental bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States certify it as harmless health and population organizations will supervise studies in how it can best be used Dr Baulieu said he hoped that the FDA would be persuaded by the pharmaceutical house associated with the product  Hoechst in the United States  to speed up the toxicity tests on the steroid The FDA is very conservative he said and it takes its time on contraceptives since it does not regard them as urgent medical problems The saying is that it takes 10 years and 20 million dollars in costs to get a contraceptive certified as safe Dr Baulieu believes that his steroid is free of many of the potential objections attending other such products and could therefore be certified much more quickly It had he said a basic advantage over the birth control pill with whose inventor Gregory Pincus he once worked The pill is taken for three weeks out of four and therefore the body is exposed to its side effects for most of the time With this device the exposure is only four days out of 30 and the risk is thus far less In addition he said it had the advantage of flexibility The decision to use it could be taken month by month Not using it  when for example there had been no sexual activity during the month  would be less disruptive than briefly dropping the pill The latter works by regulating the entire menstrual cycle he said and suspending use means that an entirely new cyclical pattern must be established Dr Baulieus product on the other hand simply produces a temporary blockage of the uterine receptor which ceases as soon as its use stops  Termed a Promising Approach American contraceptive experts said yesterday that the new French birth control compound is in a class of chemicals that represent one of the most promising approaches to contraception A related compound is currently under study here by the Winthrop Laboratories a division of Sterling Drug Inc Rather than interfering with the normal hormonal cycle as the current oral contraceptives do the French compound blocks the action of progesterone the hormone needed to sustain pregnancy It is believed to work by occupying the chemical sites in the uterus that normally serve as receptors for progesterone In effect it sets up a receptor blockade although levels of progesterone in the blood remain normal the hormone is unable to maintain the thickened lining of the uterus that is essential to pregnancy When progesterone action is blocked the uterine lining is sloughed off as it would be in a normal menstrual period According to Dr Wayne Bardin Director of the Center for Biomedical Research at the Population Council in New York City the new drug uses a principle that researchers have been investigating since the late 1960s It looks like Dr Baulieu may well have come up with a compound that would inhibit the action of progesterone It could be used to induce abortion or to bring on a menstrual period Dr Sheldon Segal director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation said several other compounds like the French one have been looked at and found wanting because they were not 100 percent effective in reducing progesterone action He added that the preliminary clinical studies with the French drug indicated that it blocked enough of progesterone action to terminate an early pregnancy However he noted that the new compound may also have an unwanted effect on the adrenal gland suppressing production of important hormones from the adrenal cortex There are two ways that a drug like this might be used Dr Segal explained A woman might take it once a month whether she is pregnant or not or she could wait until she missed a period and then take it Which way to go will depend on side effects If the drug suppresses adrenal function you wouldnt want to knock that out for four days a month In such cases it would be better to use it only if a period is missed
Liberalism and the Chinese Bedroom,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/20/opinion/liberalism-and-the-chinese-bedroom.html,Something like 1984 already seems well entrenched in China Fox Butterfields illuminating report Sunday in The New York Times Magazine documents the chilling extent to which all daily life is monitored An engineer avoids telling anything personal to people at his workplace knowing that workers can be ordered to tell whatever they know about each other Local street committees can search ones house at any hour And probably the most chilling aspect of social control is one with an American echo The local street committees are so powerful they decide who can have children a task they take seriously People are assigned to keep track of each womans menstrual cycle According to Mrs Tian a committee member If someone misses her period and isnt scheduled to have a baby we tell her to have an abortion There isnt room for liberalism on such an issue Mrs Tian might find it hard to believe but in this country there are people who would regard her as a flaming liberal Some of them are eager to impose a squeal rule on birth control clinics requiring them to inform on teenage patients to their parents Such a rule is sure to drive up the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies Others Right to Lifers they are called are as determined that America forbid abortion as the Chinese are to require it The Right to Lifers are often libertarian in other respects But when it comes to abortion they have no qualms at all about pushing government into the most anguished corners of peoples private lives These the Mrs Tians of America are not content to discriminate against poor women by eliminating Medicaid funds for abortions They now press for legislation and even a constitutional amendment to forbid abortion altogether President Reagan is among them two weeks ago he wrote to an Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life that he hoped Congress would act to restore protection of the law to children before birth  in other words to legislate against abortion The Americanstyle Mrs Tians also denounce liberalism and they may not readily acknowledge the contradiction between their general attitude toward government in private life and their attitude toward government in the bedroom Nor are they likely to find a lesson in Mr Butterfields report But the rest of us ought to Government intervention in family planning may be called mandatory abortion in China or Right to Life in America Its real names are snooping squealing and prying
OF SEX AND LIBERALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/22/opinion/of-sex-and-liberals.html,Why do liberals panic when faced with certain aspects of sexuality and social mores Mention the word chastity and they get all nervous and giggly This at least has been a common response to the Reagan Administrations proposal requiring parental notification when adolescents obtain prescription contraceptives from federally funded clinics Demographic evidence may suggest that reducing the extent of adolescent sexual activity not sex education or contraceptives is the key to controlling teenage pregnancies Yet the idea that public policy might be designed to inhibit adolescent sexual activity is something liberals cannot discuss calmly it is easier to huff about Moral Majoritarians Has some profound liberal taboo been offended This seems odds in view of liberalisms own proclivities While conservatives tend to see the status quo as a reflection of unchangeable human nature liberals have insisted that the status quo can always be modified by social and environmental influences But when it comes to adolescent sex liberals act as though they are confronted with an unalterable law of human nature indeed an uncontrollable force of the natural world To suggest that current trends toward earlier and greater sexual activity among adolescents might be curbed and reversed is as ridiculous as King Canutes ordering the tide to halt Better liberals suggest to limit the damage by providing contraception and abortion as easily as possible In another way to be sure liberals recognize that the extent of adolescent sexual activity rather than being a natural fact is as artificial as our need for Sony Walkmans designer jeans and other appurtenances of our culture As one group providing contraceptive information to teenagers puts it Current American culture injects sex into advertising books magazines television movies and popular songs From the suggestive to the blatantly erotic sexual content or connotation pervades the mass media and inundates our teenagers The Moral Majority couldnt have expressed it better Conservatives however still entertain the idea that something can be done about advertising books TV movies and song lyrics This something usually involves moral exhortation boycotts censorship in schools rating systems and social pressures With the possible exception of censorship liberals think that these responses are fine when applied to South Africa infant formula and racial prejudice when applied to adolescent sex they are positively preposterous The only alternative is to accept the status quo In this case accepting the status quo is exactly what the conservatives oppose In their eyes departing from the usual practice of requiring  Margaret OBrien Steinfels is author of Whos Minding the Children The History and Politics of Day Care in America Peter Steinfels executive editor of Commonweal magazine is author of The Neoconservatives parental consent for prescription drugs helps to legitimize the sexual option as the familyplanning professionals like to call it Nobody can prove that just as nobody can prove that Harvards holding stock in corporations doing business in South Africa helps legitimize apartheid In the real world sexual activity like all kinds of other things is influenced by so many different factors that it is impossible to isolate and measure the impact of a single change in public policy The same thing is true about the conservative argument that excluding parents from the process of providing adolescent contraception is one more factor undermining parental authority generally Liberals to be sure favor parental involvement in sex education Wise parents begin when their children are young moving step by step from hamsters to mommies and daddies But liberals balk at the idea that public policy might invest this friendly persuasion with yes parental authority Yet the conservative argument on both counts makes sense To some unknown immeasurable degree a proposal like the Administrations would probably delegitimize adolescent sexual activity and relegitimize parental authority The honest liberal response ought to be that such a diffuse uncertain gain isnt worth the pregnancies that will result when faced with the prospect of parental notification a certain proportion of adolescents decide to forego contraception but not sex And the honest conservative should reply Were willing to risk more pregnancies in the short run in order to create a social climate where the level of adolescent sexual activity and of pregnancies as well is lower in the long run But why the honest liberal then asks are you starting here with contraceptive services We start wherever we can says the honest conservative When we threaten to boycott TV you act outraged When we complain about rock lyrics you sneer at us as prudes OK where would you start And the honest liberal says Well what does the honest liberal say
YOUNG BUT NOT INNOCENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/books/young-but-not-innocent.html,In 1957 the year my library card was upgraded to YA drugs meant penicillin grass was something you mowed to pad your allowance and when you wanted to read about sex you climbed up to a top shelf and filched Lady Chatterleys Lover A Young Adult novel in those days provided a firmly edited version of reality with ethical and romantic dilemmas scaled down to our budding comprehension and our treasured innocence The best ones did this without condescension and without leaving the reader feeling that something was missing Out of limited materials they created complete dignified novelistic worlds Todays young adults know more than we did about the complexities of life and the clay feet of authority figures With television in the house drugs for sale in school and divorce and teenage pregnancy rampant it would be pointless to pretend they dont And todays YA novelists do not pretend indeed it could be argued that some go overboard in the other direction An inventory of six books Ive just read has the sordid topicality of the 6 oclock news five deceased parents three divorces two abortion clinics an affair between a teenage boy and an older woman one child abuser one wife abuser a couple of mental hospitals marijuana PCP pornography and prostitution Its enough to send an Old Adult running for Tolkien But a closer look reveals that the determinant of good taste isnt what a YA author writes about but how  and how well Its fascinating to see how six different writers graft todays obligatory frankness onto the traditional aims of the YA novel entertainment and empathy with perhaps a light touch of moral guidance Sixteenyearold Billie James heroine of Sandra Scoppettones LONG TIME BETWEEN KISSES Harper  Row 1050 has grown up in SoHo and Greenwich Village and she dodges drug dealers and street crazies with aplomb Harder to take lightly are her divorced parents her mother a failed artist turned carpenter who lives in a loft and calls herself Arley Carpenter and her father a failed musician who freaks out on angel dust and has to be dragged away in a straitjacket What can Billie do under the circumstances but cut her hair very short and dye it purple This precipitates a breakup with her boyfriend and soon Billie believes shes in love with a mysterious older man of 21 about to be confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis Weird huh Yet this relentlessly uptodate scenario camouflages a conventional YA plot basically good kid learns basic moral lessons like doing the right thing hurts but its better than selfish fantasy and you dont have to dye your hair purple to be noticed The emotional dimension of the book rings true Sandra Scoppettone handles the tension between Billies surface jive and her deeper loneliness very nicely But the moralizing has that whiff of condescension under the hip surface is a sugar pill THE GIRL IN THE GRASS by David Roth Beaufort Books 1295 starts out as a promising psychological Gothic and ends on a note of sour realism Seventeenyearold Tom Stevens adopted as a baby by his aunt and uncle has been haunted all his life by images of a girl with long golden hair singing in tall grass On a trip to Boston he sees paintings in an art show that exactly match his visions He leaves his small town and moves into a seedy Boston rooming house to search for the painter who is the girl in the grass  his longlost sister Sylvia Sylvias trail leads in and out of art galleries and mental hospitals Tom finally finds her only to lose her again because she cannot face the pain of their shared past  an alcoholic sexually abusive father Tom comes out of it with two gains a gallery owner he met while searching for Sylvia becomes his supportive older lover exactly how much older she is or how Tom feels about this initiation we never learn and a therapist helps him piece his identity together The authors decision not to deal with Toms sexual experience at all seems an odd omission in an otherwise blunt book Mr Roth also disappoints the reader so bitterly with his nohappyendings ending that it almost violates the unwritten laws of storytelling for any age TWO POINT ZERO by Anne Snyder and Louis Pelletier NALSignet Vista 175 does away with another illusion that has been a staple of YA fiction that of a moral adult universe When Kate Flemings flashy stepfather absconds after losing all the familys money Kate must work her way through Pacifica College to fulfill her dream of being a lawyer like her late father She goes to work for an intense moody graduate student who runs a tutoring service for football scholarship students tutoring service being a euphemism for a termpaper writing operation that is paid for by the Athletics Department At first Kate feels that its cheating but she needs the money and is attracted to Brock her boss who encourages her rationalizations Youve got to work the angles to get by Youve got to cheat a little  Everybody cheats And not just here in college Outside as well The authors show that the reasons for cheating arent simple survival and dreams are at stake for all The college condones the tutoring scam because the football team supports the budget A principled teacher knows whats going on but fears for her tenure Brock needs money to send to his widowed mother A bigtime freelance writer wants to expose the scam not on principle but for money and splash The editor of the school paper agrees to fink in hopes of a career and a car And so on The serious treatment of this challenging issue a natural for classroom debate doesnt quite mesh with the books sprightly preppy tone when it comes to dating romance looks popularity and clothes Nonetheless theres suspense three possible romantic male leads and a happy ending Kate resolves to follow her noncheatin heart The title of UNBIRTHDAY by AM Stephensen Avon Flare 195 is symptomatic of the books cheekyclean tone its what high school lovers Charlie Dutton and Louisa Billingham decide to call the day of Louisas abortion They are the two most unconventional kids in a square town shes an athlete and computer whiz hes a poet and musician Theyre in love and theyre careful to practice birth control Nonetheless Louisas period is late and she and Charlie face the big decision Their story is really an excuse for the author to offer some good liberal prochoice sex education The reader accompanies Louisa whose parents arent told of her situation through a gynecological exam and pregnancy test a consultation with a bright sympathetic counselor and finally to the abortion itself The presentation is upbeat at once graphically frank and subtly sanitized almost too reassuring sex is OK love is OK abortion is OK no regrets no problems SAILING HOME by Cynthia King Putnams 995 is the beautifully written if mildly melodramatic story of a boys return to his Long Island hometown and to his girlfriend after two years of wandering the West with members of a hippie commune Paul had left home at 16 at the climax of a long slow estrangement from his mother and grandfather that began with his fathers death from cancer and ended with an unjust accusation of statutory rape Teaching sailing hed been becalmed in fog with 14yearold Mary Lou the daughter of strict religious parents who had recently moved to Long Island from Texas Paul and Mary Lou did nothing but kiss which was electric and frightening enough for them but Paul fled the ensuing trouble Now hes back changed taking a changed Mary Lou for a sail remembering his own dreamlike experiences with sex and drugs and wondering somewhat sullenly about hers By the end of the sail theyve discovered each other and the delicate link between love and responsibility The hereandnow parts of this book are fine Mrs King sensitively plays the tensions of wind sail and rope against the exploratory tensions between Paul and Mary Lou and unlike many of these writers who either jolly sex up or gloss it over she captures the way young people really feel about making love and about smoking grass Unfortunately the flashbacks to Pauls commune life are much less convincing Theres just one flawless YA performance in all the seven books I read Lynne Reid Bankss THE WRITING ON THE WALL Harper  Row Charlotte Zolotow 1050 Mrs Banks is English and so is her slang copper daft rows but no matter American young adults will identify with her perfectly pitched story of a 16yearold pulled between her Polish survivor fathers steady anchoring love and the temptations and dares of her Punk peers Maybe because Tracy Just comes from a solid family a vanishing species in YA fiction these days she brings a healthy skepticism to the risks her father knows every teenager must take visiting a dance hall with her Punk friend Connie a gallant character whose mother is battered by her father and who movingly explains the hurt idealism underlying Punk tentatively necking with her broody boyfriend Kev joining a group trip to Holland led by Michael a schoolmates older brother In Holland Tracy almost goes to bed with Kev who leaves her stranded in the apartment of two friendly pornographers unknowingly gets her bicyle pump packed with contraband heroin and falls in love with Michael It could be sensational it isnt Its a tightly crafted novel which is true to the awareness of a 16yearold without any behindthescenes preaching
TREATING YOUTH CONFIDENTIALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/nyregion/treating-youth-confidentially.html,WOODMERE IM here for birth control she said because of a recent extremely upsetting incident My friend had to have a pregnancy test No my parents dont know I am here  basically because I dont really talk to them Unsmiling she continued her countenance disconcertingly sad She said that her boyfriend waiting outside was involved in her decision to obtain contraceptives This was her first visit to the clinic Ive always been concerned about possible consequences the 17yearold said since I started having sexual relations at age 14 Another 17yearold girl waiting to see a pediatrician at North Shore University Hospitals Five Towns Adolescent Health Service said she had come for birth control a gynecological examination and a pregnancy test Although clad in designer jeans and carrying a fashionable leather purse she said that it helps that the medical service was free because she did not have money A minimal fee will be charged starting in July I asked myself if I tell my parents what would their reaction be she said Im the baby in the family When she had the flu recently she went to her mothers physician It was OK but I would not feel comfortable going there for personal matters As for the family pediatrician she believes that he would respect her confidentiality but she is not altogether sure because he knows my mother so well Besides she said I feel uncomfortable there The kids are so young Im comfortable here Findings from a questionnaire submitted by the hospital and completed by 649 students from the 9th through the 12th grades in the HewlettWoodmere and Lawrence school districts showed that although 899 percent used a private physician and 485 percent saw a pediatrician over half said they would not seek medical aid for sexual problems or drugrelated care with their parents knowledge According to Dr Martin Fisher a pediatrician who is the centers medical director confidentiality is one of the major reasons why more and more teenagers primarily female are visiting the twoyearold clinic Certainly the physicians I know in this area would respect patient confidentiality he said but teenagers just arent sure Their attitude is Who knows if the pediatrician will meet my mother in the supermarket  Although Dr Fisher said that the center which provides complete medical services did not originally intend to become primarily a birthcontrol clinic 76 percent of the patients last year came for sexually related matters up from 57 percent in 1980 In 1981 patient visits totaled 947 more than doubling 1980s 408 On a national level studies indicate that by the time 50 percent of the female population graduates from high school they are sexually active said Dr Andrea Marks chief of the division of adolescent medicine at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset We are saying that in the average high school including the Five Towns onethird of the girls are sexually active and we believe that Five Towns may well be typical in terms of sexuality and alcoholism abuse Although the Five Towns is known as an affluent area it does not have fewer problems While we are treating general healthrelated problems here we are seeing disproportionate numbers of sexualityrelated problems The multiservice adolescent center was developed after a request by the Youth Services Committee of the Five Towns Community Council Community leaders believe that many of the needs of teenagers were not being met in traditional settings Financing was started with a 20000 grant from the State Division for Youth In 198182 the center received 114000 from the state The clinic open three afternoons a week is staffed by three universityaffiliated pediatricians and a registered nurse While adolescent health clinics throughout Nassau County are seeing a steady rise in those seeking care physicians and publichealth administrators report that a majority seek aid related to contraceptives According to Dr Rosemarie Guercia deputy commissioner in the Nassau Health Department teenagers who visit the Young Adult Services Clinic for FreeportRoosevelt are not under private care and do not opt to go to a regular clinic because they do not feel comfortable in that environment Some patients she said are estranged from their parents They live independently and support themselves Patient visits have grown so tremendously she said that the clinic is introducing a second weekly afternoon session Dr Guercia believes that patient confidentiality is one of the most important components for these youngsters Multiple services here include family planning gynecological care prenatal treatment venerealdisease treatment and general services Similar clinics for InwoodLawrence Plainview and Elmont are run by the department While a large portion of their funds comes from the county financing is also provided by the Federal Government under the Title 10 familyplanning program Concern over a proposed regulation on contraceptives obtained at federally subsidized clinics has given rise to a fear that youngsters would not go to clinics for sex information if a visit involved informing their parents The Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated a regulation intended to implement the Title 10 statute the main Federal financing for family planning services passed by Congress last year Congress said that parental involvement was to be encouraged when teenagers sought and obtained prescription contraceptives from clinics financed by Title 10 Alfred F Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood in Manhattan said that the language was clear on the word encourage but the regulation he said uses the word mandate Mr Moran said the regulation has the force of law for any clinic that takes Title 10 money He said the intent of the regulation which he termed stupid was to force kids out of family planning clinics and threaten them with pregnancy and thus deter them from having sex Planned Parenthood in Washington said recently that it would continue to provide contraceptives to minors in confidence even though the Government said parents should be notified According to the president of the national organization up to 30 million in Federal funds could be lost because of the decision A legal challenge to the regulation is being prepared About 25 percent of the patients at the family planning clinic at the Nassau County Medical Center are adolescents According to William G Theyskens the administrator if the Federal regulation were approved it could seriously impact on teenage clinic attendance  many youngsters would not come if it meant informing their parents In 1977 the number of adolescents at the countys health centers and the Nassau County Medical Center totaled 700 In 1978 Mr Theyskens said the figure jumped to 1500 in 1979 to 1900 this year it has leveled off at 2000 So there has been a steady growth in all of our clinics Mr Theyskens said And I hate to see us going backward Although the clinics offer a gamut of services most adolescents come for contraceptive advice according to Mr Theyskens At the Freeport clinic he said many teenagers are pregnant and first come for a pregnancy test Additionally we find many Freeport teenagers will travel to Inwood for their health services because they wont run into their mothers aunt there While the proposed Federal regulation has jogged the sensibilities of many groups not everyone believes that pregnancies and abortions will increase if the Government involves itself in private lives Dr Jerome S Fass a psychiatrist who is chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center Queens Hospital Center affiliation and project director of the teenage pregnancy program at Queens Hospital said that the proposed regulation would not necessarily affect middleclass teenagers who he said have mobility and flexibility with money  they know they can go to private physicians Asked whether the Government had the right to legislate sex he acknowledged that the issue was complex Nevertheless he saidif you are going to accept the dollars you have to accept certain Federal regulations Dr Fass said that an exception in the regulation which some physicians consider to be a loophole stipulates that clinic physicians have a right not to divulge confidential information if they believe that informing the family may cause physical harm to the teenager Disagreeing about this option which he called a can of worms Mr Theyskens said that a doctor must prove the danger of physical abuse and substantiate and document it and we dont quite know how to do that At the division of adolescent medicine at the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center in New Hyde Park Dr Ronald Shenker the director said that the clinic which receives Federal funds saw a patient ratio of 65 percent female to 35 percent male Serving a basically middleclass population the clinic is geared to take care of broadbased health problems he said While only 20 percent come for sexrelated problems there is a steady demand for this service he said Similar adolescent health care programs are offered at Queens Hospital and Long Beach Hospital which are staffed by the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center and headed by Dr Michael Nussbaum a specialist in adolescent pediatrics The majority who come in for routine health care Dr Nussbaum said turn out to need contraceptives At first they are reluctant to seek these contraceptives despite the fact that they are sexually active at an early age Regarding the possible affect that the Department of Health and Human Services regulation might have on the clinic Dr Shenker saidI think it is naive of the Federal Government to think they are going to legislate teenage sexuality The regulation smacks in the opposite direction of everything that this Administration stands for in the way of individual freedom The irony of the situation he maintains is that I could dispense contraceptives in my private office to a private patient It just turns the screws on poor people who come to federally funded clinics
SUMMING UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/magazine/summing-up.html,Copyright c Theodore H White This article is excerpted from Theodore H Whites America in Search of Itself The Making of the President 19561980 which will be published next month by Harper  Row A Cornelia and Michael Bessie Book  I had made myself a promise the election of 1980 was to be the last in the series of stories about American politics that I had begun in 1960 But when the election was over I found this story to be essentially different from the others What I had been seeing in 1980 was not just a single campaign it could be viewed only as a climactic episode in a stretch of history that went back for 20 years or more The election of 1980 was about that explosion of ideas which over the past two decades had torn American life apart and transformed its politics I had watched the ideas take shape in the streets in riot and bloodshed with horrors broadcast into every home Then the ideas moved off the streets toppling old walls and as the occupiers moved in the occupation spread farther than anyone could understand Of all the ideas however the most unsettling was the renascence of the oldest political idea in American history  equality before the law Old phrases only vaguely trace the hopes and turmoil of the storm decades liberation participation affirmative action outreach And they were to add up finally to a paradox What began as a quest to enlarge freedom and equality would ultimately require enlargement of Federal controls on a scale never envisioned by those who dreamed the dreams of the early 60s New phrases like quotas entitlements goals and timetables the protected classes were to signal the change in the nature of American government Those who cheered the changes and those who were horrified slowly hardened into two antagonistic camps and by 1980 two men Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had emerged as their champions In all this the original and most powerful motor drive was the revolt of the blacks Memory flecks that drive with episode It is spring 1964 the mood of the time still unsettled by the assassination of John F Kennedy and the visions he left behind The Civil Rights Act which Kennedy had brought before Congress in 1963 is now moving through Congress If it passes it will change American society But as the debate boils on Capitol Hill the action is elsewhere so as a political reporter I am off to Mississippi where the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC is mobilizing for the bloody adventure that will be remembered as the Mississippi Summer In Jackson the capital I pass through the black district Parched lawns littered with trash shack houses with peeling paint boards cracked and broken raggedy children sitting on porches peering out on nothing I pass a black cemetery pillars of the gates leaning toward each other the scraggly grass already very high in springtime but unmowed and unkempt sad Faulknerian It does its own mourning And there next to the Streamline Bar is 1017 Lynch Street SNCC storefront headquarters It is unmarked but instantly recognizable  two students one black and one white are standing outside playing catch and in the windows are those black and green stickers that say ONE MAN  ONE VOTE Inside the dominant presence is Bob Moses the field marshal of the adventure drawing hundreds of students from all over the country He talks with the lilt that New York schoolteachers have indelibly pressed on Harlem children for a generation but he has a masters degree from Harvard Blinking softspoken gentle Moses has been here in Mississippi for three years trying to rouse his black people to their rights They must be taught to vote they must be taught to do things for themselves they must be taught to be unafraid He is sweet and stubborn and strong the stuff of martyrs he will not kill but will not hesitate to die Five blacks here in Mississippi have been killed by unknown men since the first of the year Moses has spent 17 days in solitary confinement in jail his people are organizing the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the allwhite political structure of the state his people demand their constitutional right to vote And there is no one in authority to whom Moses can talk no contact No white official in Mississippi dares have contact with the blacks More people will die this summer as they seek the right of blacks to vote It is a few weeks later in New York the evening before the opening of the 1964 Worlds Fair The papers and television have been churning out the story of impending disaster The blacks are threatening to drive in and stall their cars on all the highways feeding to the fair blocking all traffic I drive out to the storefront headquarters of the stallin organizers deep in the BedfordStuyvesant ghetto of Brooklyn The storefront lies between a Chinese hand laundry and a meat market its broken glass windows are boarded over Inside the blacks glower at the coming of a white stranger not at all like the black smiles at SNCC in Jackson Miss On the wall several signs No Statement Will Be Given Without Permission of the Chairman No Outgoing Calls After 10 AM By Order of Isiah Isiah finally arrives and consents to talk He is Isiah Brunson all of 22 years old two years out of South Carolina a carpenters son He is softspoken deliberate with a fine sensitive face hair closecropped innocent But his conversation makes no sense he is all but incoherent The entire New York police force will be mobilized the next morning the dignitaries of the nation from President Johnson on down will leapfrog the demonstration and come to the opening of the fair by helicopter All except Senator Jacob K Javits born in a New York slum himself and now approaching his great authority as Senator he intends to go by subway and walk into the fair on foot black picket lines notwithstanding I accompany the Senator on the subway no television crowding us or hatching trouble in those days And when we get off the subway stop expecting to brave the chaos of demonstrations  there is nothing nothing at all Isiahs threat had been a nightmare mirage there are no stalled crowds no marching pickets no banners In the late summer of 1964 the revolt moves on into politics It is coming to the convention of the Democrats in Atlantic City For despite their sham and pageantry the conventions are where new groups first knock for entry into the power circle And at Atlantic City the black demand is to burst with a howl The howl comes in a closed and steaming room of committee hearings on credentials to determine the legitimacy of delegates Outside a thin line of pickets black and white together ring the convention hall singing We Shall Overcome They insist that the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party has a legitimate right to be seated in this national convention because Mississippi blacks have been excluded from the right to vote Upstairs in the hearing room a black woman Fannie Lou Hamer is voicing the demand with a wail that torments everyone in the chamber as she tells what happened in Mississippi when she tried to register to vote She had been arrested she says and she continues It wasnt too long before three white men came to my cell  I was carried out of the cell into another cell where they had two Negro prisoners The state highway patrolmen ordered the first Negro to take the blackjack  I laid on my face The first Negro began to beat and I was beat until he was exhausted  The second Negro began to beat and I began to work my feet  I began to scream  All of this is on account we want to register  and if the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now I question America Three days later the blacks of the Freedom Democratic Party have invaded the convention hall and occupied the seats of the allwhite regular Mississippi Democratic delegation But Lyndon Johnson holds the Democratic Party in his hand his chief surrogate is the young Attorney General of Minnesota Walter F Mondale who negotiates with black and white with Johnsons whip to back him up All together they work out a compromise The blacks of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party are to be given two voting seats at this convention But  far more important beginning with the next convention in 1968 no delegation will be seated from any state where the party process deprives citizens of their right to vote because of race or color The thrust of justice and equality was thus moving on into the political process But already seven weeks before the convention Lyndon Johnson had signed into law an act that expressed the conscience of the nation  the Civil Rights Act of 1964  a watershed in American history All previous acts of regulation by the Federal Government had been regulations of things and standards of railroads and wavelengths of foods and drugs of weights and measures The Civil Rights Act was a departure It undertook to regulate behavior Its purpose was to change the customs and manners of the American people The Civil Rights Act of 1964 guaranteed blacks access to all public accommodations across the nation not just schools restaurants and theaters but hotels and motels excluding only the hypothetical Mrs Murphys boardinghouse if it had five or fewer rooms The new law instructed the Justice Department to sue if necessary to enforce desegregation of all such facilities It went further A fiveman Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was set up All of American industry was to fall under its police power any industry or union affecting commerce that employed more than 25 workers could be summoned to account if it was suspected of discriminating against an individual because of such individuals color religion sex or national origin At one stroke now women and ethnics were also to fall under the protection of the Federal Government All the powers of government prodigious already were to be invoked to enforce the new measures Any program any activity any institution any contractor benefiting in any way small or large from Federal funds would find those funds cut off if discrimination against anyone could be proved Universities and hospitals hotels and theaters airlines and mailorder houses unions and manufacturers cities and states could now be summoned to account for their behavior One large limitation on the Civil Rights Act is worth stressing Its purpose was to insure equality The act warns that nothing in its text shall be interpreted to require any employer  to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of any race color religion sex or national origin employed by any employer With the Civil Rights Act passed Lyndon Johnson was now moving on to engage the motor of conscience with the driving wheels of politics in the form of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 That bill said Johnson in impassioned advocacy would be not the end  not even the beginning of the end But it is perhaps the end of the beginning That beginning is freedom and the barriers to that freedom are tumbling down  We seek not just legal equity but human ability not just  equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result A subtle change had transformed the quest for equality of opportunity to equality of result Within five days of the signing into law of the Voting Rights Act the first of the ghetto riots of the 60s burst in the Watts section of Los Angeles More followed from Newark to Detroit to Boston With black riots flaming the summer skies from 1965 to 1968 white conscience was tormented but white fears rose  The cleavage between the races in the streets and in the suburbs mocked the high eloquence of those who still pursued the hope of harmony and a national community At the executive level of American life and on television the ablest of the blacks would be increasingly accepted at the grassroots level where the rub came whites would begin to flee from anticipated violence My memory of political movement is caught next by the youth revolt and hangs on the Democratic convention of 1968 in Chicago the most dramatic convention of modern times Youth had never been seen as a separate problem group in American history Youth was accepted as a glandular episode that would without doubt be cured by the simple passage of time when youths became parents and taxpayers in their turn But by 1967 student youth had become a force in American politics In 1939 as America prepared for war fewer than 15 million students attended the nations colleges and universities By 1968 this number had exploded to 69 million So much had the country changed that college youth outnumbered farmers by 3 to 1 and railway workers by 9 to 1 college students were as politically important in carrying states like Wisconsin or Massachusetts as were coal miners in West Virginia or automobile workers in Michigan And they had become a critical mass  ready to let go at the spark of ignition The spark of ignition was by 1967 already there the war in Vietnam the most mismanaged war in American history The war was in the eyes of educated youth illegal No Congress had voted either a declaration of war or a national emergency yet they were being drafted by Presidential command for a cause no one properly explained and their lives were at stake Episodes of youth in revolt mark the dismal course of the war The march on the Pentagon in October 1967 The sweep of the early 1968 primaries by students for Eugene J McCarthy The riots at Columbia University in the spring of 1968 and at Harvard in 1969 The tragic confrontation in 1970 at Ohios Kent State University But what remains fixed most sharply in memory is the student intrusion at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago I watched their climactic demonstration in Chicago  an almost allwhite group of innocents and crazies all jumbled together controlled by squawk boxes of the Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam Down Michigan Avenue they march chanting and yelling Peace now peace now and Stop the war stop the war Police in triple ranks stand at the corner of Balbo Drive and Michigan Avenue behind yellow barricades cellophane sacks of toilet waste are being thrown at the police bundled packets of leaflets are being hurled from hotel windows trash cans tossed In the swaying mass of demonstrators momentarily halted fly red flags of the revolution the black flags of anarchists Omega banners and the Vietcong flags of the enemy And then  slam  like a coiled spring the police reserves from Balbo Drive burst in Like a punch they jolt The police move like a wedge into the packed mob and split it youngsters are hustled off by their elbows their heels dragging on the ground a woman is dragged along the pavement her head bumping the concrete The police club tear gas bursts over the crowd The squawk boxes of the mobilization call out Cool it now lots of people are getting hurt  Cool it cool it Please dont throw things dont throw things But memory of the chaos must not obscure what the youngsters accomplished First if the Vietnam War was lost as it was to be a major defeat had occurred on the streets of Chicago The whole world is watching the whole world is watching chanted the youngsters as television lights and cameras carried the scene around the world to Vietnam encouraging enemy resistance in that Asian civil war that was to end with the victory of tyranny Second the Democrats  swept by the noise and clamor punished by televisions snatches of the youngsters sad confrontation with the police seeking to mollify the protesters  would pass two resolutions to reform the party These resolutions designed to purify the way delegates were selected required every state party to give youth minorities and women proper representation at future conventions  or be excluded No matter how ordinary Democratic voters might vote in the future at primaries or caucuses these groups must be guaranteed representation in and of their own right not as representatives of the general electoral constituency Third most of the earnest youngsters of the 1968 insurgency of Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy as well as most of the youngsters of the 1972 campaign of George S McGovern would go on to jobs careers homes and families with the insurgency only a romantic memory But thousands would not give up the memory They had developed new techniques of vote gathering learned how brittle were the old machines they had challenged outwitted the oldstyle politicians over and over again recognized computorial analysis and television manipulation as vital tools of the politics to come Blacks and youth had won their entrance to equality by violence and demonstration in the streets as much as by appeal to conscience The next group would win by appeal to conscience and reason alone victories that may be even longer lasting These were the women of America Women in America as everywhere else had been regarded as legal and social inferiors from the beginning It was Thomas Jefferson who in 1807 said The appointment of a woman to office is an innovation for which the public is not prepared nor am I For more than a century and a half women were regarded if not as chattel as wards of the state and their families protected in some cases by law deprived in other cases of rights by the same laws The modern push for womens rights begins in the Kennedy Administration in 1961 with the calling together of a Commission on the Status of Women and moves on from there to the forming of the bipartisan National Womens Political Caucus 10 years later Until the 1970s women had been one claimant group among many a group recognized sporadically and symbolically by token appointments in government or by the voters in elections where the quality of an outstanding woman might command loyalties The National Womens Political Caucus was different It meant not to plead but to demand not to beseech but to mobilize power by votes at any point of vulnerability in the male power structure Here again memory pinpoints a place and time of breakthrough  the Democratic convention at Miami in 1972 For there was no doubt that among the many power groups jostling in Miami a totally new almost irresistible center of pressure was the recently formed National Womens Political Caucus The scene at their headquarters was that of a bad soap opera  the damp dismal seasprayed Betsy Ross Hotel where the charge was 8 a night per room Phones jammed elevators were crammed One remembers the littered rooms the unmade beds dressers strewn with yogurt cartons the cockroaches and cooking odors the mimeograph and copy machines in the corridors which ran until the hotels ancient fuses blew and on the third floor indelibly stained on the old rug in red paint WOMEN POWER 1972 But there was nothing comic about what they represented or the force behind them In a single year from a standing start the caucus had mastered the mechanics of politics Women had been observing men practicing politics for years  but usually as handmaidens at conventions and campaign headquarters They knew how to code names of delegates how a boiler room operated how to buttonhole plead lobby threaten  and how to move whips about on the floor of an uncertain convention These skills were now organized Every one of the state delegations at the more than 40 Miami Beach convention hotels was circularized with bulletins leaflets news Every night bluejeaned volunteers rode the buses to stuff the mailboxes or slip reports under the door of every delegate Their sisters on the floor were identified by cause and issue They installed their own switchboard to link them to key delegations in the rival commands of McGovern and Hubert H Humphrey  There were several moments of recognition of this new force in being this new call to attention One remembers the explosion on the convention floor of that issue which torments modern women most  abortion for the first time publicly debated at a convention in the presence of television Forced to floor debate by their caucus opposed by the governing McGovern majority as a political disaster about to happen the women are voted down Nonetheless there was the issue now out in the open Should not a woman have personal control over her own bodys reproductive processes One remembers the overnight candidacy of a woman for Vice President the campaign of Frances Sissy Farenthold organized at 2 PM on Thursday breaking through the thicket of rules and credentials so that shortly after midnight Thursday Farenthold could astound the convention and even those who voted for her by gathering 40404 instant votes And one remembers the triumphant passage of the womens plank in the 1972 Democratic platform bringing that party out squarely for the nomination of a woman to the Supreme Court which Ronald Reagan would do and far more important for the equal rights amendment to the Constitution But women while they waited for their amendment would have to rely on the Federal courts to decide just how far the enlargement of their rights might legitimately go  and whose liberty must be chipped to enlarge their own From the nations beginnings the idea of equality has rested on the courts authority to translate that idea into law As Alexis de Tocqueville had said so many years before There is hardly a political question in the United States which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one The Supreme Courts role in the transformation of American politics started with its historic decision of May 17 1954 on school desegregation known as Brown v Board of Education of Topeka All previous decisions on race from the Dred Scott decision of 1857 through Plessy v Ferguson in 1896 were overturned Segregation of children by the color of their skin blacks to one school whites to another  was declared to be the denial of equality Less noticed in the flow of events was the decision of the court a yearlater known as Brown II This not only reaffirmed the first Brown decision but strengthened its mandate by conferring on all lower Federal courts the power of injunction to see justice done Federal courts however are led not by Olympian selfless personalities but by individual men and women subject to all the temptations of power conviction and applause Presented with this opportunity to make law they moved into areas of custom and behavior that had previously lain within the authority of the states By 1962 the Supreme Court which had traditionally removed itself from what it called the political thicket had moved forward a notch ruling that each state must so apportion its local legislature that representation by districts must give each citizen an equal vote dissenting Justice Felix Frankfurter called the majority decision a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past By February 1964 the Supreme Court had extended the logic of equality to the Congress itself ruling that one man one vote must also apply to the apportionment of Congressional seats So far so good But by 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the landslide election of Lyndon Johnson the lower courts followed the lead of the highest court and by injunction gave busing its reach and its wings Boston was a case study Its demography had been changing year by year as middleclass whites left for the pleasant Bay State suburbs north and south But between 1970 and 1980 Boston was to experience a panic flight of those whites who would not resist busing as did the ItalianAmericans of East Boston or the IrishAmericans of South Boston The white population decreased from 524709 to 393937 while its minority population increased from 116262 to 205155 Even more dismaying in its schools  the first free public schools in the nations history  the proportion of white to minority children began to drop Whites made up 685 percent of the school population in 1968 In 1974 W Arthur Garrity Jr a Federal judge issued his busing ukase And by 1981 outside of East Boston only 26 percent of the citys publicschool children were white White families simply refused to send their children into black neighborhoods they considered dangerous and black families complained that all the burden of busing for equality fell on their children Across the nation the same startling reversal of proportions in big cities repeated itself as Federal courts pressed Federal orders on the teaching of young children in their hometowns The original decision in Brown v Board of Education had not been a decision to integrate schools but to desegregate them  to free black children in any neighborhood where they lived to enter that neighborhoods school or black students in any state where they lived to enter their state university Black children must not be shipped from their homes to schools miles away simply because they were black But by the 1970s white children could be ordered onto buses and directed to leave their neighborhoods for no other reason than that they were white And the courts assumption of power continued to increase The logic of equality that applied to schools everywhere was ultimately to apply by court order to municipal police systems to fire departments to Federal and local civil servants and to reach farther and yet beyond to unions and corporations Braced by the mood of the times the courts found their mandate for a central ordering of affairs An entirely new jurisprudence was born  the jurisprudence of classaction suits This jurisprudence had begun with the classic case of Brown v Board of Education which theoretically concerned itself with one child Linda Brown denied access to her allwhite neighborhood school in Topeka Kan because she was black Then slowly suits brought by individuals against institutions gave way to evergrowing numbers of suits brought by groups against government and institutions in classaction litigation By the early 1970s sometime in the Nixon Administration it had become quite clear that for people who sought a new social or political goal it was far more efficient to go to the courts than to go to the voters or move through Congress where every step forward required the building of a new coalition in the House in the Senate in committee staff in pressure groups The courts were now spraying the United States Constitution into every nook and cranny of national life into matters best left to state legislatures or about trivia that in other times might have been left to city halls or town councils The Constitution was made by the Federal courts to address the issue of whether nude dancing constitutes freedom of speech whether dueprocess protections must be observed before an unpaid water bill leads to service interruption whether males have the right to receive alimony whether males should have the right to buy beer at the age of 18 instead of 21 if females have that right in the same jurisdiction whether female soldiers can confer benefits on their spouses whether private schools have the right to reject a student not to their liking whether a white homeowner has the right of refusal to sell his home to a black Matters that once had been left to the judgment of private persons communities or states were now raised to the level of national issues in which the national courts imposed their interpretation of the Constitution on state or community Such extension of appetite could not but arouse a naturally litigious nation to respond Publicinterest law firms constituted themselves publicinterest guardians they multiplied in Washington and multiplied again At the bar of the Supreme Court they could win  or delay what the public conscience required In 1961 the Supreme Court had entertained only 1940 pleadings By 1979 at the height of its invitation to pursue equality it was entertaining 4731 cases intricate pleadings all averaging more than 20 each working day It was clearly impossible for any sober judicial mind to grasp them in all their complexity Thus perforce opinions were shaped by law clerks and young lawyers imbued with the vision of a Federal Government and a Federal court imposing equality and justice for all establishing behavioral patterns in a nation that previously had thought behavior best left to local community judgment The courts were pioneers in the extension of Governments reach but it was Congress that set the perimeters of that reach And Congress entered the 60s with an illusion of limitless American power at home and abroad A quick backward look sets the stage Franklin D Roosevelt had led the nation through two grand emergencies the Depression and the war and his Congresses despite one or two revolts had been wax for his modeling After Roosevelt it took 19 years for Congress to regain its old authority but by the election of 1964 Congress and the President were partners again That election had brought to Washington the famous 89th Congress accompanied by a President who loved Congress stroked it massaged it twisted it to his ends Entitlements at damnthecost had always been part of American history From the Civil War to the New Deal veterans farmers old folks had been successively entitled to special recognition of their needs The Congresses of the Great Society however pressed the Governments reach into countless corners of American life where Federal dollars and Federal bureaucrats had never been seen before In 1964 came a basic antipoverty program a masstransit bill for city dwellers a permanent foodstamps program a program for legal aid to indigents In 1965 followed Medicare for over 65 years of age Medicaid for the poor aid to elementary and secondary schools across the nation college loans and scholarships the Voting Rights Act expanded housing programs with subsidies for lowincome families regional economic planning and development programs Of the farflung programs of entitlements passed by the Great Society Congresses and their successors a number of very serious truths must be stated First each program was pressed through Congress in the name of virtue No single program could be denounced vetoed or buried in committee without the objectors being shamed for their indifference to the call of conscience Who for example could turn his back on the distress of the handicapped If a regulation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 required that all urban transit systems which drew money from the National Mass Transportation Assistance Act provide ramps wheelchair lifts and special aids for the handicapped who would quibble about what it might cost Who could object to scholarship loans to college students Or object to a national recognition of the contribution of artists writers musicians orchestras dramatists dancers actors to the nations wellbeing Congress for almost 20 years chose not to choose among programs but to enact them all There comes next a second truth All entitlement programs tend to grow in cost In 1956 for example Congress had passed a disability insurance amendment to Social Security estimating it would rise in cost to 860 million by 1980 By 1980 it cost more than 15 billion a year There is a third fundamental truth to be stated about the growth of the Federal Government the truth that recalls one of the oldest laws of American politics All great reforms leave behind a legacy of bureaucracy These bureaucracies harden from bands of reformers into collectives of time servers until usually they are packed with political figureheads who are engineered into decisions by their permanent staffs of true bureaucrats controlled by the interests they were supposed to regulate Gradually as the 1970s wore on and inflation began to bite a change in mood crept over Congress Throwing money at problems was becoming unfashionable  so Congress began to throw regulations at problems Agencies grew and grew again From 12 in 1970 the social regulatory agencies had grown to 18 in 1980 and their budgets from 14 billion to 75 billion The older agencies of Congress  the Interstate Commerce Commission and Civil Aeronautics Board and Securities and Exchange Commission for example had been what students of government call vertical agencies assigned to patrol a particular industry that had grown so large as to threaten the public interest industries such as railroading banking securities and airlines The newer agencies were horizontal They could rove and patrol across the board regulating and intruding into any factory any school any hospital built with Federal aid any university that drew from Federal funds or whose students won Federal loans and scholarships As the agencies grew the appetite of the regulators expanded In 1960 the Code of Federal Regulations rested at 22877 pages by 1980 it had grown to more than 100000 pages No Congressman or Senator had any but the vaguest idea of what the verbiage meant But such regulations had the force of law and would be enforced by the courts only skilled lawyers  and Washington flourished with new law and lobbying firms staffed very heavily by people who had written the regulations  could understand one or another section Only they knew the corridors or offices in which decision or relief might be found Good will lay behind all these steps to the federalization of the nations Government  and many achieved memorable good But one movement in the grand transformation slowly developed year by year into a monster whose shadow hangs over all American politics today the division of Americans by race and national origin into groups entitled to special privileges Beginning in 1964 the purpose of the Civil Rights Act has been twisted year by year through Executive order judicial fiat and bureaucratic appetite into a reverse discrimination never envisioned and specifically forbidden by the act itself By 1980 there were in Washington at least 18 jurisdictions that policed all institutions private and public alike in the pursuit of what was called racial balance Chief among these were the Departments of Justice of Labor of Commerce of Health and Human Services not to mention the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Management and Budget All have had the power to define and discriminate among Americans  based on whether they belong to a minority group or to the nations majority The Department of Health and Human Services once listed seven categories of Americans other departments list five Generally however these are the groups of special racial or ethnic entitlement blacks of African origin Hispanics sometimes called Spanishspeaking or Spanishsurnamed American Indians and Alaskan natives sometimes subdivided into Eskimos and Aleuts Asians or Pacific Islanders sometimes called Orientals and whites not of Hispanic origin One must trace a glide from the old phrase affirmative action to the subsequent phrase goals and timetables to the present reality of federally enjoined quotas Where the phrase affirmative action originated no one knows It popped up for the first time in federalese in an executive order issued by John F Kennedy on March 6 1961 It was in its purest sense an effort of the Government to remedy past injustices in American life Ancestors of the blacks had been shipped to America in coffles without their consent and broken to slavery Ancestors of the Indians had been broken in spirit driven from their hunting lands penned in reservations Now however affirmative action would seize the bureaucratic imagination and those assigned to enforce it would expand the thought It was in 1969 that the phrase goals and timetables was introduced  during the Nixon Administration And with goals came the Philadelphia Plan of defining just who is or is not to be employed on Federal construction projects From there goals hardened into quotas although never acknowledged as quotas By the twilight of the Carter Administration the Philadelphia Plan had gone nationwide with the goals set precisely for all major cities In Philadelphia 173 percent of a contractors work force would have to be minority employees in the District of Columbia the figure was 28 percent Moreover 16 affirmative action steps would have to be taken under the new mandate by all 8000 contractors working on projects funded with Federal money In the name of affirmative action judges attempted to wipe out city and county boundaries in order to import white children to spread among blacks in the innercity schools A whole sequence of orders and decisions attempted to classify children and their teachers by the color of their skins abolishing neighborhoods in the pursuit of equality of rights Even New York that most liberal of cities rebelled when teachers were ordered to register by the color of their skin so that as the Federal court enjoined black and white teachers be distributed across the city away from their homes The intent was that both black and white children might be equally exposed to black and white instruction Next came the decisions on municipal and state employment policies There is not a single city in the United States that is not in one way or another dependent on Federal funds Thus each may be subject to a Federal determination as to whether its employment or educational practices reflect equal opportunity This reaches across the board It has required San Francisco to teach Chinese students in Chinese and Hispanics in Spanish It required Bridgeport Conn to employ all 84 black and Hispanic applicants for its fire department who had failed the written entrance tests given to all other candidates It required Stamford Conn to hire one minoritygroup applicant for every white applicant to its fire department until a quota of 175 percent was reached Such decisions rising to the final judgment of the Supreme Court came to a climax in a case denominated Fullilove v Klutznick in which Philip M Klutznick the Secretary of Commerce was sued by H Earl Fullilove At issue was one of the first acts President Carter had pushed through Congress an emergency program of public works  4 billion to stimulate the economy  of which 10 percent of the contracts must be awarded to minority business enterprises In July 1980 the Supreme Court ruled the measure constitutional by a vote of 6 to 3 But who then was a minority In one dissent Justice Potter Stewart declared Today the Court  places its imprimatur on the creation once again by Government of privileges based on birth  Because of the Courts decision today our statute books will once again have to contain laws that reflect the odious practice of delineating the qualities that make one person a Negro and make another white With its ruling the Supreme Court had passed an invisible mark in the struggle for civil rights Back in the days when affirmative action was acquiring the force of morality it had been the great effort of the Government to remedy the old wrongs visited by white Americans on blacks and Indians Now there was a race law and an illdefined race law Americans had visited no harm on recent Chinese arrivals from Hong Kong or Taiwan But as Orientals they were entitled to privileges by birth  even though ChineseAmericans and JapaneseAmericans were said to be among the highestincome groups in the United States Prejudice has always been a fact of American life In the kind of country we made each new wave of strangers had been warily accepted with suspicion by those already here Experience had slowly forced older Americans to regard new arrivals as other Americans and particularly after World War II when their valor and service in war eroded old prejudices But now by the late 70s it was not equality of opportunity that was sought but equality of result stipulated in goals quotas and entitlements based not on excellence or merit but on bloodlines Newly arrived and underprivileged peoples had earned by law regulation or judicial fiat particular privileges as protected classes Women and young people were also protected Such people were active inside the arena of politics they had claims to advance and new rights to protect By the time of the election of 1980 they had become separate ingredients of politics and when they were mixed with older claimants of privilege  farmers veterans banks railroads oil companies  American politics were splintered By bundling the identifiable splinters a voting majority could be assembled By 1980 36 million Americans received their monthly Social Security checks 22 million drew Medicaid benefits 26 million more Medicare 18 million supplemented their budgets with food stamps 15 million received veterans benefits 27 million children were nourished by schoollunch programs 11 million drew from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children programs Most of these categories overlapped so that there was no way of determining their global numbers Moreover there were the millions of young people who enjoyed Federal scholarships and loans to go to college and millions of women who if denied the avenues to the careers they sought could appeal to the courts to open the doors All in all perhaps half the population of the United States depended in whole or in part on Federal aid or protection All this had happened so gradually that few realized how much the nature of American government and politics had changed Government had ceased to be as Franklin Roosevelt once saw it the umpire between business and labor between the rich and the poor it had become the nourisher of dependency Convinced of Americas limitless power and propelled by the best of intentions the countrys leaders and its dominant thinkers had pushed the old America entirely out of shape It was as if one surgical operation here another prosthesis there had all come together crazily in a body that if not crippled had been transformed No one had planned it thus But there it was For conservatives the slowly unfolding drama of the previous 20 years had been one of growing menace They had tried once with Barry Goldwater to upset the trend they had tried again with Nixon but he had turned out to be a closet regulator Nixon had extended Governments control to the first effective environmental surveillance he had imposed price controls introduced grander school lunch programs construction quotas new safety and health regulations This time the conservatives were going to try with a man they were sure they could trust The election of 1980 then was to be a new chapter in the old national debate Just what was the nature of the Federal Government and what were its limits The Democrats would build their campaign on defense of the old visions the challengers on a denunciation of those visions That would be the central underlying theme of the campaign But politics had changed both in substance and style and the candidates would grope to make their messages clear in the clutch of circumstances beyond their control There was first the national humiliation the sense of the old power lost as Iranians held hostage and tormented 52 Americans whom we were powerless to rescue There was moreover the reign of television Americans had once gathered to hear politicians at state fairs at factory gates or in lunchhour crowds on city streets They now gathered at their television sets  and televisions evening news dominated the political process Television dictated how where when the candidates would campaign But most important of all the underlying conditions was inflation By 1979 a contagion of fear and anger had spread through America Millions who had invested in savings bonds or put their dollars in savings banks to provide for their childrens education or their own retirement years felt cheated Promises had been made by their Government in the language of dollars and now the promises were being repudiated in money that might 20 years later become all but worthless For three decades Republicans had warned of just such a disaster  and been ignored But by 1980 they enjoyed the counsel of a corps of intellectual outriders of a quality not entertained by their party since Theodore Roosevelt gave up the White House 72 years before From the Hoover Institute at Stanford Calif to the American Enterprise Institute of Washington from William F Buckley Jr to Irving Kristol conservative thinkers were furnishing ideas that ran counter to the liberal creed They questioned the entire transformation of American life and government Of the Republican candidates approaching 1980 none was more enthusiastic about such new and conservative ideas than Ronald Reagan 68 twice Governor of California a candidate for the Presidency for almost 12 years Reagan was a man who embraced causes who had entered politics with a message No one could speak more simply about large ideas than Ronald Reagan once a Democrat now a devout Republican His campaign rested on his message a challenge to all the holy truths of the great transformation But underneath lay a shrewd understanding of how the message could be amplified by dramatics personality and anecdote to stir emotions His first testing was to come in New Hampshire in 1980 There running against George Bush in the nations first primary he was to show his ability to draw voters to the polls Who were the Reagan voters In New Hampshire I found no one who gave an apter description of them than the chairman of the Reagan campaign Gerald P Carmen Carmen was a businessman who had made his small stake in Manchester and moving up moved in on the striferidden local Republican Party Who are we he asked repeating my question Most of us said Carmen are the first generation of our community or family who went to college Our people are on the make Were middle class Bush has the elite the old Yankee aristocracy of the valley but ours are people whove bought the first house in the family who want to get ahead and they dont want the Government to take it away Im at home when I talk to Ronald Reagan The Reagan message came in two parts The first was the message of the personality In a season of melancholy his good nature pleased The camera stimulates Reagan as catnip does a cat he loves the oneline quip He could quip about Carters call for national austerity A man who tells you he enjoys a cold shower every morning will lie about other things Or about the difference between a depression when you lose your job and a recovery when Carter loses his As a person Reagan could wring out of the people an echo louder than any his opponents could inspire The second part of the message was the substance the theme that was so elementary it could not be misunderstood the theme so many Americans wanted to hear Their Government was choking them wasting their money forcing up prices poking its nose into local affairs In the years since 1966 when I had first followed a Reagan campaign in California the message had changed but little A few new quips were added now and then but quips so banal that television would not carry them they therefore seemed fresh and unworn to his live audiences who chuckled along with him as once they had with Jack Benny of the JellO show I recall a capsule of Ronald Reagans stump oratory delivered in Cleveland just before the end of the exhausting primary campaign of 1980 Rain is about to fall as he rises so he must hurry and skip the quips There float up from my tape recording the disjointed phrases of his essential message When he Carter took office inflation was 48 percent and he said he was going to do something about it and he did Its now averaging 164 percent  Time to turn this country around  Everything thats been done means more taxes more inflation more unemployment  Why dont we try to leave more money in your hands for you to spend the way you like  Incometax cut over a three year period  Reducing cost of Government  Deficit monster  Federal aid to education has become Federal interference  I see the rain is coming down a little bit harder Why dont we get to the closing point  God bless you all  Thank you and I need your help on June 3 The rain is pouring down now the band plays Glory glory hallelujah and the crowd cheers The next day after a jaunt through the Midwest the candidate found himself in New Jersey It was late afternoon when he finally directed his caravan back to Newarks airport He was booked on a commercial flight to Los Angeles and then on home to Pacific Palisades and the ranch Throughout the campaign he had been so amiable and charming that I had come to like him as a person he is a decent man I asked to speak with him Reagan came to sit beside me As he talked I realized that his personal charm concealed a political indignation as deep as Barry Goldwaters This man was an ideologue His basic outrage over the transformation of the country was not simply a trick theme for his speeches it was built into the man a part of the essential person He had once been a devout Democrat a union leader and I asked when he had turned Oh he said the turning began back there in the 50s when I began to warn against the growth of permanent institutions of the Government They were beyond the control of the elected representatives of the people Even back then our party the Democratic Party had bought the new economics which rested on a theory that a little planned inflation would not get out of control  But you cant plan a controlled inflation its like radioactivity cumulative  There was a time back there when I said to Nancy Every four years Ive got to go out there for these people and I dont go along with them  Reagan went back to his political breakaway But out of the New Deal interrupted by the war came I think a permanent structure of Government that had in mind not as I believe Roosevelt had in mind a temporary medicine for the ills of the Depression  they had in mind a permanent change in Government The Federal Government would usurp functions which properly belong at the state level  They acquired that strength that has made them almost more powerful than those we elect to office The massive staffs of Congress are now definitely part of the bureaucracy We hear that the people call for these things  you know the truth is I can never recall the people ever asking for any of these things Most legislation is born in the departments of Government  Then they look around by way of a Congressional staff or a Congressman or a Senator who will sponsor the legislation  Once a Congressman came up to me and told me what would happen if he took on an important agency or opposed its budget The first time your secretary calls that agency for any help for information they say We dont have the manpower to do that  He spoke of President Kennedy who had upset him especially in the Bay of Pigs incident We landed those men there Reagan said and then we abandoned them He talked about his reputation in the East as a reactionary  some kind of rightwing fascist   and went on to say that in 1976 in his primary campaign against Gerald Ford I found when I crossed the Mississippi River coming east the horns began to grow out of my head at least in the minds of those people He added Its much less today  Theyve learned about my record as Governor We talked of issues Busing Its a failure it didnt work It had created more bitterness than it had eliminated Busing was a waste of resources Illegal immigration He thought it was a broader problem than the United States could solve by itself it needed an international understanding Were all ethnics he said You and I are too  My grandparents came here in the potato famine fleeing Ireland  On my mothers side they came from England where they picked up broken bricks at a brick factory and built an oven and baked and sold bread door to door so they could get the money to come here steerage I had held him now for a goodly time and I began to realize that the man despite his courtesy was exhausted and not just from this talk and this day but from his five months on the road But one more question Where did he think Jimmy Carter had gone wrong Reagan groped for a reply and the answer came out this way Well  What I think went wrong with him was his hunger for the job and the office was so great that he said anything to get it  It was not a desire to say I want to do this I want to do that  I wonder whether hes confusing some of his own statements with having come from God We stopped He went forward and settled down beside his wife to watch a movie He enjoyed it she drowsed The primary ordeal was over his nomination was locked up the only problem before him was the election and the contest with Jimmy Carter Elections are important they give Americans not only their chief sense of participating in their Government but more importantly a sense of control Control is what politics is all about But the campaign of 1980 was concerned not only with control but with national purpose There was a sense in the nation that America had gone off the track almost as if we had lost our way into the future It remained to be

KOCH AND CUOMO ASK TO BE LIBERAL PARTY NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/nyregion/koch-and-cuomo-ask-to-be-liberal-party-nominee.html,Each depicting himself as probable winner of a Democratic primary two candidates for Governor of New York Mayor Koch and Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo  asked the Liberal Party yesterday for its nomination Publicly Liberal leaders said they would sound out the opinions of our membership Privately they said they favored Mr Cuomo The Liberal endorsement could be of great significance in a campaign that is unusually fragmented This is a wild wild world and almost anything can happen Mr Cuomo said outside the meeting room at 165 West 46th Street Each of the candidates met for about an hour with the Liberals 34member policy committee which is usually able to decide what the party will do Through the closed doors one burst of laughter and applause was heard for Mr Koch who listeners said was quieter than is his habit in City Hall Mr Cuomo relaxed and chatty was applauded several times Speaking to reporters outside Mr Koch renewed his warning that a separate Liberal candidate could be a spoiler Mr Cuomo brushed off the spoiler theory saying I expect to win the Democratic primary The candidates were told beforehand that there would be no immediate decision Committee members will return to their home constituencies around the state to convey their impressions of the meeting and sound out the opinions of our membership said Raymond B Harding a party vice chairman He said afterward that the decision should be made in a couple of weeks Usually the Liberals make common cause with the Democrats for major office In some years when they have not the Democrats have lost as they did in 1980 when the Liberals supported John Anderson for President and Jacob K Javits for Senator The only time the Liberal Party ran its own candidate for Governor in 1966 it fragmented the opposition to Nelson A Rockefeller who that year won a third term The choice before for the Liberal Party is not an easy one If it rejects Mayor Koch who takes outspoken pride in his long memory for slights he could if he won press for passage of a bill already filed in Albany to ban crossendorsements of candidates Such a restriction could sharply reduce the power of minor parties But it they rejects Mr Cuomo the party could be confronted by a Cuomo candidacy on an independent line similar to the coalition that formed behind Frank J Barbaro in last years New York City mayoral campaign The party must also weigh the prestige of ballot position For decades because its candidate for Governor polled the third highest number of votes the Liberal Party had the third column But in 1966 they were passed by the Conservative Party and in 1980 by the Right to Life Party passed them leaving Liberal Party candidates with the fifth column in 1982 If the Liberal choice loses the Democratic primary the candidates would compete again in November  as happened when Mr Cuomo the Liberal lost to Mr Koch the Democrat in the 1977 New York City mayoral election This year there is also commotion on the ideological right with Conservative Party leaders pledging their line for Governor to Lewis E Lehrman a wealthy businessman who is one of four candidates for the Republican nomination The others are Paul Curran a former United State Attorney James L Emery the Assembly minority leader and Richard M Rosenbaum the partys former state chairman The Right to Life Party according to Ellen McCormick its candidate for President in 1976 would consider endorsing a major party candidate who supported its antiabortion principles So far Mrs McCormick said yesterday we havent found one

Ideas & Trends in Summary; Testing 'Natural' Abortion Drug,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-testing-natural-abortion-drug.html,Its like a morningafter pill only many mornings after said Dr Sheldon Segal director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation He was referring to a drug developed in France which taken four days at the end of the month seems to terminate early pregnancies through a process resembling natural abortion With years of testing to go the drug was announced last week by Dr EtienneEmile Baulieu a leading French biochemist on his induction into Frances Academy of Sciences Dr Baulieu described the drug as a steroid pill that jams the chemical sites in uterine cell membranes through which progesterone is absorbed Progesterone prepares the cells to accept and maintain the fertilized egg With the sites blocked the cells do not react to the progesterone and are sluffed off producing more or less normal menstruation Dr Baulieu said If a fertilized egg has been implanted it is dislodged The pills advantage Dr Baulieu said is that women would use it only four days a month and when not sexually active need not use it at all There is a certain safety element in not taking a pill every day for weeks as one does with oral contraceptives said Dr Segal He noted that the drug may have an undesirable sideeffect suppressing the adrenal glands production of vital hormones such as cortisone In limited testing Dr Baulieu said he observed temporary reversible adrenal changes Jane Murray of the Alan Guttmacher Institute which specializes in family planning research said If proved safe the drug would be a breakthrough in birth control but not contraception since it is not a contraceptive It is an abortion agent
WHAT CABLE OFFERS CHILDREN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/arts/what-cable-offers-children.html, Alexis Greene is a freelance writer who frequently reports on childrens television programming By ALEXIS GREENE As the amount of regularly scheduled childrens fare dwindles on conventional broadcast television and as more and more homes in the metropolitan area become wired parents and their youngsters are increasingly looking toward cable television The following is a survey of whats available or soon to appear on local cable systems Nickelodeon the 13houraday sevendayaweek channel specifically designed for young viewers will be coming to Manhattan cable homes beginning next Saturday morning the service which Warner Amex has been producing since 1979 is already carried by systems in New Jersey Connecticut and upstate New York Locally Manhattan Cable Television will inaugurate the service on Channel 10 and Group W Cable of Manhattan until a week or so ago known as Teleprompter will launch the service on Channel J For a while schedules will omit some of the programming both Manhattan systems have had to juggle to make room for the satellitedistributed service Because initial feed times and encores are different subscribers to these systems are urged to check listings Nickelodeon presents a wide diversity of content and formats documentaries and feature films a sports show with former Yankee outfielder Reggie Jackson rock concerts theater productions dramatic serials such as Matt and Jenny about a brother and sister who trek through Canada in the 1850s to find their family and The Adventures of Black Beauty 52 halfhours based on the childrens novel by Anna Sewell and coproduced in England by London Weekend Television and Talbot Television The cinematography acting and attention to detail for recreating life in 19thcentury England are of the highest caliber One particularly laudable aspect of Nickelodeon is that its programming is geared to specific age groups For instance Pinwheel on mornings Monday through Sunday is designed for preschool children it offers a colorful wellwritten mix of songs and skits puppets and real people The differences between reality and fantasy are set forth in a clearly understood manner with quiet lessons about behavior offered along the way The block of Nickelodeon programming deemed suitable for elementary to teens includes a mesmerizing halfhour called What Will They Think of Next Acquired from Science International the program boasts a font of information about such diverse phenomena as miniature bike races in Japan underwater pipelines and robots Nickelodeon attractions for teenagers include Livewire an hourlong talk show on weekends Originating from the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and with a 29yearold humorist and writer named Fred Newman as host the program invites its studio audience to join with experts in discussing such topics as budgeting finances abortion and teenaged suicides The programs generally communicate substance rather than hype Just about all the fare within Nickelodeon is free of excessive violence The service does however have its shortcomings With such an extensive agenda of programs Nickelodeon has yet to provide a series with an ethnic focus Skeptics may also mutter I told you so in light of Nickelodeons recent decision to allow underwriting  up until this year the channel had been touted as commercial free Now backers  commercial advertisers as well as foundations  are offered 10 seconds between programs to insert a company name and slogan thus claims about a specific product are supposed to be avoided And scant enthusiasm can be mustered for programs like You Cant Do That on Television coproduced by Warner Amex and Carleton Productions The show purports to be a kind of young persons LaughIn slapdash vignettes tastelessness and all One recent imaginary billboard The Dukes of Hazzard Dress Up in Drag will not be seen tonight Among other programming for children available on Manhattans cable systems one of the more noteworthy contributions is Calliope which regularly offers hourlong mixtures of unique short films The USA Cable Network a New Jerseybased satellite service programs and delivers Calliope to Manhattan Cable on Channel I Mondays through Fridays at 6 PM with a threehour selection of the weeks more outstanding offerings on Saturday mornings at 830 and on Sundays at 730 AM and 6 PM Tomorrows bill will include Lafcadio  The Lion Who Shot Back a 22minute film derived from Shel Silversteins popular book for children Lafcadios Adventures USA has also succumbed to commercials to support its childrens programming Although the service initially vowed to seek only institutional advertising a spokesperson for the company explained last week that such sponsors are hard to come by cereal spots now abound On CBS Cable available on Manhattan Cables channel K on Tuesdays at 8 PM Norman Lear is the host of the halfhour Quiz Kids an updated version of the popular radio and earlytelevision series featuring astoundingly knowledgeable youngsters ranging in age from 7 to 14 Under the umbrella title Superstation Funtime WTBS on Manhattan Cables channel F weekdays at 7 AM and 3 PM and on Saturday mornings from 630 to 10 offers a grab bag of cartoons offnetwork rebroadcasts and publicTV fare such as the oftrun mathematicalinstruction series Infinity Factory Pay cable woos the elementaryschool child adolescents and parents through material that is supposed to appeal to the whole family Despite this intention the programming is scheduled at times when the likelikhood is that only young people will be in front of the family set early early weekday mornings middletolate afternoons and Sunday mornings Paycable services have primarily presented films and the offerings for children are largely a mixture of theatrical releases and shorter movies HBO 1150 per month on top of 1175 for basic cable seen on Manhattan Cables Channel H and on Group W Cables Channel I schedules an average of seven films a month Cinemax HBOs complementary service at 1250 extra per month presents as many as 12 short films a month Manhattan Cable Channel P and Showtime 1095 extra per month averages seven a month Group W Cable Channel H The quality of the films for children improves steadily on HBO Manganinnie a featurelength film that will be shown again tomorrow afternoon at 5 was made by the Tasmanian Film Corporation set in the Australian bush during the 1830s it is a touching film about a young girl who is befriended by an aborigine As for Showtime its policy is to slot in among each months rather undistinguished array of childrens fare a halfhour dramatic film usually from the Learning Corporation of America Next month the selection will be The Last of the Caddoes about a young Texas boy who discovers his Indian heritage its first showing will be May 3 at 9 AM Traditionally community and access programming on cable television veer from the wellproduced to the embarrassing Yet the local cable operator can program imaginatively for subscribers if he sets his mind to the task Group W Cable of Manhattan which serves a large Hispanic population carries Big Blue Marble a documentary series from ITT dubbed in Spanish One of the more intriguing program efforts of Group W Cable is District 6 Presents a series produced by students from that school district which covers the area from 135th Street on the West Side to the upper tip of Manhattan publicaccess Channel C Tuesday afternoons at 2 with recablecasts Wednesdays and Sundays at 6 PM also available via Manhattan Cable on Channel C at the same times District 6 has an audiovisual coordinator who acts as liaison between the schools and the cable system Group W provides a small two color camera studio and technicians the students conceive write direct and act in their halfhour programs which are often outgrowths of their curriculum For example the eighth graders at St Judes School recently created UnWitnessed News a wellexecuted spoof of ABCTVs local newscasts Manhattan Cable is less enterprising with its localorigination programming Channel 10 however the system does offer several programs organized by youngsters themselves such as Mark Shichtmans Kids News on Channel D on Thursdays at 5 PM and Saturdays at 1230 PM and Sports Rap with David Hautzig on leaseaccess Channel J on Friday evenings at 830 These programs surface somewhat sporadically viewers are advised to check listings

MOYNIHAN AFTER ONE TERM: THE PROS AND CONS OF INDEPENDENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/26/nyregion/moynihan-after-one-term-the-pros-and-cons-of-independence.html,In a hotel ballroom in New York the other day a thousand people listened in engrossed silence as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan delivered a ninepage treatise on the merits of American government and the principles of the founding fathers Along the way the Senator found reason to touch on nuclear war the Middle East the Atlantic alliance and Argentina Some five years earlier at the start of his Senatorial career Mr Moynihan expounded week in and week out in Senate Banking Committee hearings on the need to rescue a nearly bankrupt New York City His persistence was a crucial factor in persuading reluctant legislators to pass Federal loan guarantees for the city During his first term as a Democratic Senator from New York Mr Moynihan who announced his candidacy for a second term Saturday has strived to fulfill two roles One is that of a diligent legislator who faithfully represents his constituency and the other is that of a leader in the realm of national issues and ideas On Capitol Hill where Senators are often described as belonging to the old school of for example Daniel Webster versus the new school of a bureaucratic legislator the 55yearold Mr Moynihan is viewed as being of the old school Believes in Both Roles But Mr Moynihan who along with a flair for ornate speech brought to the Senate a background of service to four Presidents two tenures as an American ambassador and a Harvard professorship believes both roles can be played effectively The Senators are representatives of states in the American constitutional system he said during a recent interview in his office They are also United States Senators There is no conflict at all There are two things to be done and they are During his first term Mr Moynihans intellectual celebrity and diverse range of concerns  from defense and national security to welfare and Social Security to tax policy to water resources  dominated the record Another characteristic that stands out is Mr Moynihans independence Admirers say it is a virtue but they caution that it tends to make Mr Moynihan forget about building coalitions A former highranking Carter Administration official said Mr Moynihan did not follow through often enough to gather sufficient support to get his legislation passed Mr Moynihan believes the criticism may have some validity Perhaps theyre right he said But give me a chance Ive only been here five years Mr Moynihan has been able to articulate his policy interests through his positions on the Finance Budget Environment and Public Works Committees and on the Select Committee on Intelligence where he is vicechairman He arrived in the Senate in 1977 when the city was bankrupt and the State was in awful shape he said His first order of business was to get us well again  and we have He was able to make his case by documenting and publicizing for the first time that New York sent more tax dollars to Washington than it got back in Federal outlays Difficulties With Tax Cut Mr Moynihan is proud of being the first New Yorker in 50 years to serve on the taxwriting Finance Committee But it is also the place where he appears to have had the most difficulty making up his mind and making his intentions clear According to several people who were privy to his thinking during the debate on the personal income tax cut last year the Senator had a hard time deciding what to do Before the votes he argued that the second and third years of the cuts should be tied to the size of the deficit The country could afford the first year of the tax cut but not the magnitude of the proposed second and third years he said In the end he voted for the Reagan tax package these sources said because he felt that the cuts just might work by increasing investment Almost immediately Mr Moynihan expressed misgivings In a speech before the Business Council of New York State Mr Moynihan called for a midcourse correction keeping many of the fine features of the new bill but reducing its cost by 250 billion He received swift criticism for the speech  criticism according to his staff that he did not expect  and a wek later he backed off In late September he told a group of newspaper editors that he was prepared to give the Presidents economic projections a year to work Favors ThirdYear Cut This year Mr Moynihan has said that he favors retaining the third year of the cut because it makes no sense to raise taxes during a recession In contrast a colleague on the Finance Committee Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey voted against the personal income tax cut and believes the third year of the reduction should be deferred While he is not the most businessoriented Democrat on the Finance Committee  Senators Russell B Long of Louisiana and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas are considered to hold those positions he is recognized on Wall Street as being very supportive according to Arthur Levitt Jr the president of the American Stock Exchange John M Albertine president of the American Business Conference believes Mr Moynihan has been particularly helpful in the area of capital gains Mr Moynihan voted to reduce the top rate on investment income from 70 to 50 percent which had the effect of reducing the maximum rate for an individuals capital gain to 20 percent He then wanted to go further and introduced a parallel amendment to reduce the capital gains tax for corporations The Finance Committee voted down the move as too expensive His most successful legislative initiative last year was to close a relatively arcane tax loophole used by Wall Street and Chicago commodity traders known as commodity straddles With the backing of the Finance Committee chairman Bob Dole Republican of Kansas a Moynihan bill to ban these tax avoidance devices was passed last August resulting in a saving to the Government of 17 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation Welfare Reform Expert In a different area he has used the Finance Committee to attempt to satisfy the needs of some New York City specialinterest groups who support him He has introduced a bill to allow investment tax credits for theatrical producers and a provision that would allow an artist to deduct the total value of an art work if it is donated to charity Because he wrote President Richard M Nixons Family Assistance Plan to provide a guaranteed minimum income Mr Moynihan is considered the most knowledgeable Senator on welfare reform He has used that expertise both to become a vocal critic and to get the Child Welfare Reform Act of 1980 enacted The act gives cash to people who adopt hard to place children and encourages adoption instead of foster care During the Carter Administration he argued  unsuccessfully  that the Administrations welfare legislation should have as its first priority an assumption by the Federal Government of a greater share of the local costs of welfare and Medicaid He needed the fiscal relief and the Administration was unwilling said Stuart Eizenstadt the chief Carter domestic policy adviser In the Reagan era the Senator has thundered against the cuts in social programs especially those that affect children and reduce work incentives for welfare recipients Halted Child Welfare Cuts His protests against the Reagan domestic cuts brought results in one instance when the Child Welfare Reform Act was saved from attempts to dismantle it Mr Moynihan told the national Catholic magazine Sign last year that he believed abortion was sinful But he has a consistent record of voting for Medicaid financing for abortions and he told the magazine that abortion is a judgment which people have to make Mr Moynihans administrative aide Timothy J Russert who is one of the most active Senate aides on Capitol Hill asserted that Mr Moynihan had voted consistently in favor of Medicaid financing for abortion than Senator Edward M Kennedy The executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action Leauue Nanette Falkenberg said however that according to the leagues analysis of votes both Senators had the same voting record She said Mr Moynihan had been much more outspoken than Mr Kennedy He is a very very good friend Miss Falkenberg said We rely on him very heavily Favored Tuition Tax Credit On the question of tuition tax credits for families with children in private schools Mr Moynihan in the words of one liberal Democratic colleague is monomaniacal We do not build and maintain strong and vibrant public schools by turning them into educational monopolies Mr Moynihan has said The Senator views the issue as one of social justice but it is a stand that has caused him some political grief The leaders of the Liberal Party in New York have been particularly hostile to him on this issue And while the AFLCIO regards Mr Moynihan as an ally it parts ways with him on tuition tax credits Mr Moynihan has what aides on Capitol Hill describe as the enviable talent of the quick response He was the first to respond when the Reagan Administration wanted to cut Social Security said one top Democratic aide on the Senate side A lot of people wish theyd been able to respond so quickly on that issue He was in effect the author of a nonbinding Senate resolution last May that called for undiminished Social Security payments The resolution passed 96 to 0 and the Reagan Administration immediately retreated On the Environment and Public Works Committee Mr Moynihan is the ranking member of the water resources subcommittee In 1979 together with Senator Pete V Domenici Republican of New Mexico he introduced a national water resources bill that would end Federal porkbarrel water projects by sending the money directly to all states He pushed through an amendment to the Synfuels Act of 1979 for a 50 million longterm research project into acid rain Supporter of Israel In foreign policy where he is an unequivocal supporter of Israel and an advocate of a conventional military buildup Mr Moynihan has been less active in the Senate than some thought he might be But he has been outspoken on the outside both in writings and in speeches A writer by trade he earned 25803 of his adjusted gross income last year of 80046 from lectures and writings and is believed to be the only Senator with a typewriter beside his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building Mr Moynihan wrote a frequently discussed piece for The New Yorker magazine in 1979 arguing that the SALT process was not resulting in arms reduction but in arms increases He then introduced an amendment that would require the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate real reductions in strategic weapons within two years Mr Moynihan voted for the development but not the deployment of the neutron bomb and the MX missile Perhaps most perplexing to both liberals and conservatives about Mr Moynihans recent activities is his sponsorship of both of the nuclear freeze resolutions before the Senate Mr Moynihan says he sees no conflict between supporting the JacksonWarner resolution which would permit an arms buildup while negotiations take place to reduce nuclear arsenals and the KennedyHatfield resolution which urges the superpowers to negotiate a verifiable freeze at existing levels Mr Moynihan asserts that the threat of Armageddon is so near that any approach  including President Reagans  that says stop building start reducing but negotiate it and verify it is right

BIRTH-CONTROL RULE MAY BE MODIFIED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/garden/birth-control-rule-may-be-modified.html,The Reagan Administrations proposal to require notification of parents when minors receive contraceptives at clinics that receive Government funds may need refining so it will not be an undue burden on the clinics an official of the Department of Health and Human Services said this week The Administration is also prepared to reconsider whether the rule ought to apply to intrauterine devices as well as to birthcontrol pills according to Marjory Mecklenberg Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs She described those issues as two of the major difficulties spotlighted by the public debate over what some of its detractors have termed the squeal rule Since the proposal was announced Feb 19 the department has received more than 40000 letters They have not been sorted so it is not known how many are from those convinced the regulation will lead to more unwanted pregnancies and abortions as familyplanning agencies and other critics contend and how many think it is appropriate Federal action to insure parental responsibility and control as its supporters maintain Mrs Mecklenberg said in an interview after the 60day period for public comment closed late last week that she was optimistic that an evaluation of the responses could be completed before the summer was over Even without a review of the letters problems with the proposal have become clear Mrs Mecklenberg said that one fear was that the regulation would prove expensive in practice Clinics would have to notify parents within 10 days of giving a prescription contraceptive such as birthcontrol pills or IUDs to those under 18 The clinics would also have to follow up to make sure the notices had been received Exceptions would be granted only in cases where there was evidence that a teenager might suffer physical harm We do need to look into the whole recordkeeping or verification procedure Mrs Mecklenberg said Noting that the object was to make it possible for clinics to operate without an undue burden she said We need to take a good hard look at that and whether it is workable The other problem area she cited was the question of IUDs  whether there are significant health risks with IUDs to have it included Planned Parenthood a leading opponent of the regulation has cited the Governments own statistics showing that the risk of death from pregnancy and childbirth is greater for teenagers than the same risks from birthcontrol pills or IUDs The risk of death from pregnancy and childbirth among adolescents is 111 per 100000 live births compared with 08 per 100000 for IUD users 12 for nonsmoking users of pills and 14 for users of pills who smoke About 95 percent of teenagers receiving prescription contraceptives are given birthcontrol pills The health problems associated with the pill are concentrated in women over age 35 who smoke Planned Parenthood maintains IUDs which present the risk of infection in the Fallopian tubes are seldom prescribed for adolescents who have not been pregnant Diaphragms pose no health risks except those associated with pregnancy from contraceptive failure the organization says The Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S Schweiker has emphasized that the Administration has been criticized from all sides for advancing the regulation One side which has said the proposal is too weak would prefer an outright requirement that parental permission be given before those under 18 could receive contraceptives The other side contends that the regulation is an attempt to impose a national moral standard and maintains that it will not deter teenagers from sexual intercourse but will drive many who would otherwise seek contraceptives away from clinics resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and in abortions
POLITICS AND GOD'S 'PROPHETS',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/29/opinion/politics-and-gods-prophets.html,Those who speak in the name of God have the hardest time learning that politics is the art of compromise Politics involves giveandtake You win some you lose some The prophets of God who are too sure of themselves expect only to take to win Citizens who disagree with uncompromising divines on the urgent issues of the 1980s have to begin arguing with them Argument can produce some agreement only if it is based on disagreement not confusion Confusion is what we have whenever any mixing of religion and politics is countered with charges that it violates the separation of church and state Lets survey the battle scene In 1970 19 religiously liberal and 8 religiously conservative interest groups vied in politics In the new conservative journal This World Paul J Weber a social scientist at the University of Louisville announces that by 1980 in a total field of 74 such groups 30 were liberal and 34 conservative Most of the 26 conservative groups that entered the political fray in the 1970s were Protestants lobbying for the New Christian Right These newcomers were sullen about loss of status Years ago public schools were junior wings of the Protestant church Suddenly they seemed threatened by a chaos of values The rightists were angry about social changes that affected the family resentful of courts and news media that did not promote Protestant moral understandings When they organized their enemies charged violation of the separation of church and state In 1982 Roman Catholic bishops mainline Protestant congregations Billy Graham and others call for nuclear disarmament Their critics also complain of violation of the separation of church and state  Laws and regulations cannot and dare not anticipate or regulate every form of religious expression in the political zone The public has to rely on some instincts of fair play or take counteraction to block religionists who want the moral field all to themselves Fair play brings its own rules of the game First nonreligious or religiously passive Americans cannot fairly expect religiously committed people to park their deepest beliefs and values as they mount political platforms or enter polling booths What people believe or disbelieve about God can  and should  shape their attitudes toward bombs and butter A second rule asks for consistency in playing the political game One cannot consistently fault Catholic bishops as violators when they agitate against abortion and praise them as lawabiding when they promote disarmament policies The New Christian Right cannot complain about liberal meddling in politics by others and then expect to go uncriticized when it wants law to support say prayer in schools  Third religious leaders have to know that they risk resentment and taint when they mix religion and politics as they must and should Political enemies are not likely to become spiritual friends This is also a good time to remind groups that they can contribute to the Republic by keeping their own acts pure In 1958 the writer Arthur Cohen noticed that the primary source of religious tension has its origin it would seem in the fact that the religious are not content to restrict their authority to their own members Convince congregations to turn off vulgar television shows to stop having abortions and there is less need to reach for laws Finally counterorganize The huge public that opposes the New Christian Right has only itself to blame if it goes to sleep waking only to grumble about separation of church and state while the fundamentalists win their way Counterorganizing will force compromise as the rightists have begun to learn They began with a dangerously narrow vision of a Protestant America Attracted to the antiabortion views of many Catholics they broadened the dream to one of a Christian America Many fundamentalists have strong proIsrael sentiments These led them to alliances in the name of a JudeoChristian America More recently wanting claim on the Founding Fathers some of whom were not very JudeoChristian they advocate a traditionally theistic America Given time they may come to understand the Founders view that all types of people not only the conventionally godly were to make up this Republic As for good counsel during the 80s Yes do watch out for overt violations of the line between church and state Better work for creative disagreements new arguments and some hopes for new agreements based on compromise To that end when someone organizes counterorganize
BAR LEADER ASSAILS MOVES TO STRIP COURTS OF POWERS ON SOCIAL ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/29/us/bar-leader-assails-moves-to-strip-courts-of-powers-on-social-issues.html,The president of the American Bar Association warned today that efforts in Congress to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction over school desegregation abortion and other issues threaten the rights of all of us David R Brink speaking at the National Press Club compared the Congressional approach to a missile that could plunge us into internal strife and destroy our rights the courts or our Constitution The theme was a familiar one for Mr Brink an activist president of the 290000member bar association Nine months into his oneyear term the Minneapolis lawyer has established the customarily conservative organization as an vigorous defender of Federal court authority against attacks from the new right Mr Brink was careful today to avoid direct criticism of the Reagan Administration which has refused to take a position on the 30 bills now before Congress that would limit the ability of the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts to enforce the Constitution In January Attorney General William French Smith used a forum at the bar associations midwinter convention to attack political policymaking by the Federal courts A Cool Relationship The relationship between the bar association and the Reagan Administration has been cool since Mr Brinks predecessor William Reece Smith Jr led the organized bars attack on an effort by the Administration to dismantle the Legal Services Corporation which provides legal assistance to the poor I sincerely hope the Administration will end up opposing the bills Mr Brink said today in answer to a question I would have hoped the Attorney General and the Justice Department would have spoken earlier The occasion for Mr Brinks speech was Law Day which the bar association has sponsored for the last 25 years every May 1 The purpose of the day he said is to celebrate the rule of law But he continued We are endangering our continued progress under the rule of law by preoccupation with turf disputes over the rules of the three branches of government The question whether the Federal courts have overstepped their constitutional role or have merely answered the difficult constitutional questions that have been dumped on them may be debatable Mr Brink said But it is beyond debate that the present bills in Congress would overstep the constitutional role of Congress and endanger our system of government Provision in Constitution He said the framers of the Constitution provided for an amendment process in the event that the country disagreed with the way the Constitution was being interpreted But he said they never intended that Congress alone by a simple majority vote could obtain the same result For if the Congress by a simple majority vote could rewrite the Constitution he said a future Congress could wipe out Federal jurisdiction and remedies in all constitutional cases Then at best we would have 50 Federal constitutions  one for each state Only one of the 30 bills has yet made substantial progress Last month the Senate ended a long filibuster and passed a bill to prohibit the lower Federal courts from ordering the busing of students more than five miles or 15 minutes from home to achieve racial balance The measure was sponsored by Senators J Bennett Johnston Jr Democrat of Louisiana and Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina
HATCH FACES HARD FIGHT TO RETAIN SENATE SEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/01/us/hatch-faces-hard-fight-to-retain-senate-seat.html,Orrin G Hatch a conservative Republican Senator whose defeat would delight organized labor civil rights groups and feminists is in reelection trouble With various public polls crediting him with a lead of only 10 percentage points over Mayor Ted Wilson of Salt Lake City Mr Hatch is widely regarded by Republicans nationally as in more difficulty than any other incumbent of their party except Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut They worry because a Democratic victory in Utah would be a serious blow to Republicans hopes of expanding their majority in the Senate where they now hold 54 seats to the Democrats 46 Mr Hatchs problem is style and personality not a change in political philosophy in the state that gave President Reagan his biggest percentage of victory in 1980 Utahans generally agree with Mr Hatchs stands politicians of both parties here agree though some feel he has neglected state needs in pursuit of national attention His Abortion View Is Conservative Mr Wilson his Democratic opponent while less conservative than Mr Hatch on some issues such as the military and Federal spending advocates an even more sweeping antiabortion position than Mr Hatch The incumbent is an intense hardworking humorless Senator His challenger has an easygoing friendly personality that is described by one of the Senators key advisers as perfectly designed for the Utah electorate One Wilson supporter Gov Scott M Matheson said Even if you disagree with Ted you dont dislike him Kent Shearer a Hatch backer and a former Republican state chairman said that Senator Hatch can give the impression that there are only two sides to a question his side and the wrong side And the Mayor campaigns on this image telling students at Alta High School Tuesday for example that Utah needs a Senator who will be less contentious and strident Theyre Making a Mistake While the Hatch television advertising has tried to counter the Mayor by presenting the Senator as a humble family man Mr Hatch offers this challenge to Mr Wilson Hes a nice person with an attractive smile but no issues and this is a highly educated electorate If they think theyre going to beat me purely on style theyre making a mistake Mr Hatch has important advantages One is money His report to the Federal Election Commission on March 31 showed 435378 on hand and he said he expected to spend 15 million Mr Wilson reported 38752 on hand and hopes to raise 750000 His directmail efforts are aimed at constituencies such as feminists who oppose Mr Hatchs plan to let the states forbid abortions But Utahs political realities keep him from seeking much financial support from one major Hatch enemy organized labor John Perkins head of the Committee on Political Education for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said this week Hatch has one of the worst labor records in Congress and as chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee hes in a position to do us bodily damage But he sai we cant do too much without a backlash Every dollar we can raise he can raise ten by running against George Meany he said Reagan Expected to Campaign A second Hatch asset is the support of President Reagan who is expected to campaign in the fall Even though unemployment has reached 68 percent unusually high for Utah Mr Reagans popularity seems untouched A third is that Mr Hatchs tart conservatism does seem to represent Utah especially the more heavily Mormon regions outside of the capital Support for the Reagan tax cuts and military spending increases or opposition to a nuclear weapons freeze and organized labor are the positions that conventional political wisdom recommends in Utah Mr Hatch takes them Mr Wilsons strategy is to say that the Senator goes too far on some positions and is wrong on others He says Congress should have the nerve to vote to ban abortions itself or forget the issue not leave the problem to states But the challenger is not yet confident and at ease in describing alternatives to ReaganHatch positions talking in vague ways about limits on benefit programs or preferring an increase in military spending of 4 to 5 to 6 percent this year to the 12 percent Mr Reagan recommends Issue Joined on Arms The debate is clearly joined on the nuclear freeze question Mr Wilson told the high school students Im a very strong proponent We need to get a mutual and verifiable freeze of nuclear weapons and then get to the negotiating table Mr Hatch replied in an interview that it was necessary to negotiate from a position of strength not our present position of weakness With neither candidate facing an opponent in his party the general election race has really begun Mr Hatch for example spent 100000 on an early television blitz that is showing this week The ads conveyed his importantce by showing him arguing with Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts about voting rights and being questioned by Mike Wallace of CBS News The Wallace portion was edited out after the correspondent heard about it and complained But their main target was voters who in the words of Mike Leavitt the Senators campaign manager agree with Orrin philosophically but dont like him much One commercial sought to deflate the impression of certitude the Senator converys with him saying Nobody can have all the answers and I dont claim to have them And the Senator hugged children and tossed a snack to a dog
YALE IS A HOST TO 2 MEETINGS ABOUT POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/nyregion/yale-is-a-host-to-2-meetings-about-politics.html,Two historically divergent groups met at the Yale Law School the other day to discuss law and politics and how to make a mark on both One group the black alumni of the Law School held its first conference titled Under Color of Law Equality or its Semblance Its keynote speaker A Leon Higginbotham a Federal judge on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is one of the nations most liberal black judges The other new group the Yale Federalist Society sponsored the first nationwide symposium on Federalism its legal and political ramifications One of its keynote speakers was Robert H Bork who is considered one of the nations leading conservative jurists and a candidate to fill any Supreme Court vacancy At the Federalist meeting which drew 200 students from Yale and from 20 other law schools across the country Judge Bork who sits on the United States Court of Appeals in Washington criticized the trend by the Supreme Court to nationalize morality He told the group that certain things were best left for states to decide privacy contraception and abortion The problem he told his audience is that Justices on the Court are legislating morality based on their own middleclass values At the Black Alumni Conference Several blocks away at the black alumni conference Judge Higginbotham said in an interview Anything that talks about a dilution of Federal involvement can be translated as a reduction of resources particularly for the weak the poor and blacks as a class The black students held their conference in a biology building not in the Law School because the Thomas Swan Barristers Union which presents trials litigated by law students had previously reserved rooms to hold its annual prize trial competition When Judge Higgenbotham attended Yale he won the Barristers prize he said as well as the annual Moot Court Award But neither helped to get him a job in Philadelphia in 1952 he told the 125 graduates At least one Yale Law School alumnis firm rejected him but interviewed the runnersup in the Moot Court competition he said The Law School has long produced powerful figures in public life the judge said There have been formidable advocates for equal justice for blacks he said and from the opposite view there have been some revered Yale alumni who were vigorous protagonists of our advancement and who by their actions steadily besmirched at our dignity Some Law School students at the Federalist Society conference said racial integration might be one of those areas that states particularly Southern states ought not be in the business of enforcing Steven Calabreisi the president of the Yale Federalist Society said he was once a liberal in the fashion of his uncle Guido who teaches the torts course here He switched after working in President Reagan campaign His belief is that the Court and the lower Federal courts should not make law but interpret it Federalists Raise 24000 The Federalists managed to raise 24000 for travel and expenses for 60 students and 20 scholars from several groups that are backing student conservative movements across the country One group was the John M Olin Foundation and another was the Institute for Educational Affairs The institute is run by Irving Kristol the writer and theorist who is widely regarded as the founder of the neoconservative school of thought and William E Simon former Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Richard M Nixon and Gerald R Ford In contrast the black Law School alumni drew only 40 of the 220 graduatesThis is a poor peoples conference said one of the sponsors Some blacks felt it was time to get out of law and into business  We have an obligation to become very rich said Timothy Jenkins of the class of 1964 He is now president of a business concern in Washington and a Republican What we need to do is mobilize politics for social change he said And to get the power you need the money Blacks should not be embarrassed about that anymore
LEAVE EMOTION OUT OF THE ABORTION DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/opinion/l-leave-emotion-out-of-the-abortion-debate-103642.html,To the Editor Reluctant as I am to open a very old can of worms I must address your April 20 editorial Liberalism and the Chinese Bedroom The logic and editorial style of using an account of monitored daily life in China How the Chinese Police Themselves by Fox Butterfield April 18 Magazine to jump into a condemnation of RighttoLifers is questionable Be that as it may I must criticize your use of emotive and misleading language in a discussion that can only be served by clear thinking and clear speaking You take issue with RighttoLifers for having no qualms at all about pushing government into the most anguished corners of peoples private lives Here we have emotive simplicity at its best Who indeed would not object to anyone advocating pushing into the most anguished corners of the private lives of individuals The Times knows full well that the issue is not that simple The real question is whether government is right in exercising authority over abortion and what the extent of that authority should be Clearly you urge the Federal Government to pay for abortion through Medicaid Isnt it pushing into the most anguished corners to offer money for abortions Both sides of the abortion debate at least admit potential personhood in a fetus or unborn child language again Many courts acknowledging this potentiality have decided that government has a vested interest in potential life It was for this reason that the Supreme Court stopped short of striking down abortion prohibitions in late months of pregnancy It explicitly stated that government has an interest in abortion and is therefore justified in exercising authority over the actions of pregnant women The Times also criticizes RighttoLifers the Mrs Tians of America because they discriminate against poor women by eliminating Medicaid funds for abortions What rational sensitive person doesnt disapprove of discrimination Again the issue has been distorted by language The Supreme Courts 1973 decision in Roe v Wade gives all women the right to abortion but not a guarantee to the fulfillment of that right Most of the rights Americans possess do not include such entitlement We have a right to travel Not all can afford to travel Why then do you not criticize the Government for discriminating against the poor by not providing plane tickets The same could be said of many elective medical procedures And abortion is an elective procedure Finally you equate those advocating a squeal rule with those advocating a ban on abortion These are separate groups Certainly the two share members but there are many antiabortionists who support family planning and hope it will prevent the need for abortion Why equate squealers with RighttoLifers In the closing paragraph we read Government intervention in family planning may be called mandatory abortion in China or Right to Life in America Its real names are snooping squealing and prying Is this a fair summary of the issue I think not I suggest that the editors cool down a bit from their reading of the Butterfield article and attempt to give a sensitive and emotional issue such as abortion a fair and rational treatment It needs it JAMES B COMEY Williamsburg Va April 21 1982
SHOREHAM BATTLE ENTERING A KEY STAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/nyregion/shoreham-battle-entering-a-key-stage.html,THE lawyers for all sides are ready the technical experts have framed their conclusions and on Tuesday the Long Island Lighting Company will square off against its opponents and try to prove to Federal regulators that its Shoreham nuclear power plant is safe enough to operate But even as the combatants bob and weave at the hearings in Riverhead it appears that two of the most important issues affecting the future of the Islands first nuclear power plant  emergency planning and quality control will be decided largely outside the formal licensing process Although Federal regulations do not require it Lilco has agreed to allow independent experts to examine the Shoreham plant and make certain that it has been built properly Suffolk County meanwhile has scrapped a nearly completed plan for dealing with emergencies created by accidents at Shoreham and has set up a panel of experts to write a new one Both officials of Lilco and the lawyer representing Suffolk County in the regulatory hearings acknowledge that the actions are the result of public pressure applied forcefully by opponents to the Shoreham plant We have been outraucoused said Ira Freilicher vice president of Lilco in a recent interview Week after week the County Legislature has been hammered at by 40 or 50 people carrying placards who want to stop the plant and the Legislature is very susceptible to that We on the other hand are fighting with our hands tied behind our backs because we cant go out and make threats to oppose a legislators reelection One member of the team of two Washington attorneys representing Suffolk County in the Shoreham proceedings Herbert H Brown sees the situation in a different light The utilities he said are caught in the position of fighting a profound public skepticism about nuclear power because of Three Mile Island Diablo Canyon and several other plants that have had severe quality problems So if the public places a demand upon a public official and you have a strong government leader like Peter Cohalan it is extremely difficult for the utility to slam the door in the public eye This is very different from two years ago when utilities would depend on their technical staffs and could get what they wanted within the formal regulatory process he said The Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania is still disabled after the most serious nuclear accident in the country The Diablo Canyon plant in California had its operating license suspended after the discovery of more than 100 construction errors or omissions that might leave it susceptible to an earthquake Its site is near a geological fault Both issues  emergency planning and the quality of Shoreham  will be part of the formal hearings by an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that convenes Tuesday No plant in fact can be licensed without an emergency plan that is acceptable to the Federal Government The Nuclear Regulatory Commission however has determined that emergency plans need not take into account the safety of people living more than 10 miles from a plant The opponents had been prepared to argue during the licensing hearings as well as they could within the restrictions of that standard that a wider planning area was needed Now that the county has hired a team including a Yale University sociologist and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology planner to develop a new plan the opponents may not have to depend upon the persuasiveness of their arguments at the hearings to get their way Mr Brown the countys attorney who is also a member of the emergency planning team said it was possible that they would decide that planning should be done for a much wider area Because the county is the government entity responsible for handling emergencies such a conclusion could  if Lilco challenged it put the county into a confrontation with the Federal Government that could end up in court Several of the contentions  the legal term for issues that will be argued at the licensing hearings  advanced by the Shoreham Opponents Coalition deal specifically with what they charge was an absence of adequate quality control and assurance programs during construction of the 249 billion plant One of the remedies that the group had expected to seek during the hearings was an order to Lilco to allow an independent quality examination Last week after Lilco agreed to meet with Suffolk County officials to work out the timing and other details of such an examination without the opponents present it appeared that this objective would be achieved without a Federal order What SOC wants is a review of a review of a review said Brian McCaffrey regulatory supervisor of Lilco in referring to the independent quality audit By law we have a contractor to do a preservice inspection program to inspect the reactor pressure vessel all the safety piping and all the welds The county last year wanted an overseer to watch our inspection team We agreed and even though that agreement died in the County Legislature Dec 8 we hired the contractor they had selected to oversee and we have given the county that report Now SOC wants an inspection of the whole plant Its a waste of money and not necessary but we have nothing to hide The agreement to which Mr McCaffrey referred was a broad one that Lilco had negotiated with the county The utility had agreed to take certain steps such as allowing the overseer to be present in return for the countys dropping several of the contentions it had planned to argue before the licensing board Since that time County Executive Cohalan has come out forcefully on the side of the Shoreham opponents not only on the quality inspection issue but the emergency planning one as well To Mr Freilicher of Lilco Mr Cohalans action and that of the County Legislature show that they have been captured by a group of very dedicated people whom he compared to those against abortion in their singleminded devotion to their cause Informed of this comment Mr Brown said The biggest mistake Lilco could make would be to treat this as a publicrelations or a political problem
WOMEN AND MEN AND MORALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/books/women-and-men-and-morality.html,IN A DIFFERENT VOICE Psychological Theory and Womens Development By Carol Gilligan 184 pp Cambridge Mass Harvard University Press 15 SHOULD Heinz steal a drug which he cannot afford that his wife needs to save her life Elevenyearold Jake says yes of course because a human life is worth more than money Jake regards this moral dilemma as sort of like a math problem with humans and then works out the equation Elevenyearold Amy comes up with a different solution considering neither property nor law but the effect that the theft would have on the relationship between Heinz and his wife If he stole the drug he might save his wife then but if he did he might have to go to jail and then his wife might get sicker again and he couldnt get more of the drug and it might not be good So they should really just talk it out and find some other way to make the money To Amy the dilemma is not a math problem with people but a problem of relationships that extend over time To many researchers in the field of moral development Amys answer would be considered a clear sign of insufficient or illogical moral reasoning For example Lawrence Kohlberg the Harvard psychologist who devised a sixstage sequence of moral development based originally on a 20year study of 84 boys argued that women tend to get stuck at stage three where standards of morality and goodness depend on pleasing and helping others Women rarely rise to the sublime stage six where morality stems from ultimate principles that transcend selfinterest and nationality Kohlbergs work is the latest in a long line of efforts to explain why women seem to lack courage and conscience and why their judgments seem so different from those of men In this century most notably Freud told us that women have deficient superegos and therefore deficient consciences a matter of anatomy and Piaget suggested that women have deficient cognitive capacities a matter of socialization But for all the problem was that women were not making moral decisions the same way that men were And for all that difference implied deficiency These hypotheses are not therefore a trivial bit of academic ivorytowerdom Just as theories about what was the correct female orgasm affected the lives of real women and men theories of moral development are not mere abstractions They matter  to the way children are raised to female and male selfesteem as ammunition for political and personal attack  and that is why Carol Gilligans book is important Although I have doubts about the value of studying morality on a purely psychological level observing how people think rather than what they do Gilligans research certainly corrects a ludicrous bias in the field of moral development Indeed Gilligan does for her field what Matina Horner did for the field of achievement motivation There too when women didnt respond to projective tests of achievement the way men did researchers often concluded that women are not ambitious or at least not ambitious in the real way men are Horners postulate of fear of success  a notion that has subsequently been severely modified if not entirely discredited by other researchers  was a major step forward in understanding that many women simply do not regard ambition in the same way as men Gilligan explores the paradox that the very traits that have been traditionally associated with womens goodness their concern for and sensitivity to the needs of others are the very qualities that have led psychologists to describe them as morally inferior to men Gilligan argues that the issue is not one of moral superiority or inferiority but rather that men and women have two disparate modes of experience that affect their values and views of the world For instance when men and women create stories in response to illustrations that show people in varying degrees of physical proximity and distance they tend to respond differently as people are brought closer together in these pictures the images of violence in the mens stories increase as people are set farther apart the images of violence in the womens stories increase As Gilligan concludes each sex perceives a danger which the other does not see  men in connection women in separation To bolster her case Gilligan draws on previous research novels and three studies of her own  intensive interviews with 25 college students interviewed as seniors and again five years later an analysis of the abortion decisions of 25 women ages 15 to 33 and interviews with them again a year later and a lifecycle sample of males and females ages 6 to 60 matched for age intelligence education occupation and social class The metaphor for morality to many in this field is the game Boys they observe typically play games in which rules dominate Throughout childhood boys become increasingly fascinated with the legal elaboration of rules and fair procedures for settling disputes both Piaget and Kohlberg regard this legal sense as the basis for the highest form of morality Pity the poor girls who loll around playing hopscotch and jumping rope Yet Gilligan observes that in these girls games one childs success does not necessarily imply anothers failure itself a highly moral lesson if not moral in this systems terms  and that when quarrels break out girls are likely to end the game For girls Gilligan concludes continuing a relationship is more important than continuing the game  a value that persists into adulthood As her studies suggest women regard moral dilemmas in terms of conflicting responsibilities to people not ideas and they make choices based not on abstract principles but on the lesser of two concrete evils who will be least hurt The proper metaphor for female morality is the web of relations says Gilligan not the hierarchy of rules ALTHOUGH some readers are already hailing Gilligans book as a demonstration that women because of their sensitivities to others are more moral than men in fact a major strength of this book is that it does not commit reverse bigotries Indeed Gilligan takes women to task for the same moral failings that fueled Freuds original observations although she explains them in social terms instead of anatomical ones The essence of moral decision is the exercise of choice she writes and the willingness to accept responsibility for that choice To the extent that women perceive themselves as having no choice they correspondingly excuse themselves from the responsibility that decision entails Nor does Gilligan argue that womens morality is better than mens or that men are wrong or deficient her theme is that neither sex has the corner on moral superiority The vision of maturity she proposes is one that requires like the creation of a baby both male and female Gilligan argues that the male ethic of justice resting on the principle of equality must coexist with the female ethic of care resting on the principle of nonviolence In Gilligans vision Mohandas Gandhi whom Kohlberg regards as a perfect stage six would be dethroned as the epitome of moral man As Gandhis autobiography reveals the man who was so nonviolent in his political life was psychologically violent to and emotionally distant from his wife children and many of his disciples  another example of someone devoted more to human principles than to human beings The blind willingness to sacrifice people to truth however has always been the danger of an ethics abstracted from life Gilligan writes And what follows is a scathing summary of the consequences This willingness links Gandhi to the biblical Abraham who prepared to sacrifice the life of his son in order to demonstrate the integrity and supremacy of his faith Both men in the limitations of their fatherhood stand in implicit contrast to the woman who comes before Solomon and verifies her motherhood by relinquishing truth in order to save the life of her child IN A DIFFERENT VOICE is consistently provocative and imaginative on its own terms but one might well doubt whether those terms should be the primary basis of moral analysis I am always suspicious of arguments that tell me that women are x and men are y because such views confuse gender with circumstance intrinsic differences with differences due to power and status As ample evidence from history and sociology reveals peoples moral beliefs may have little or nothing to do with how they behave during an actual moral predicament I do not mean the moral predicaments that are the subject of hero movies and latenight broodings such as Would I jump into the river to save a drowning woman or Would I have protested if the Nazis arrested my neighbor I mean the daily acts of integrity that require moral backbone that are all the more difficult for often going unheralded and even punished by loss of ones job advancement or social approval Are men for all of their morally admirable legal sense any more courageous on the job than women if that courage threatens their position and security any less willing to obey lawbreaking superiors than women any less willing to conform to immoral policies than women any braver in times of war than women Ultimately what people say about their moral views tells us only what they think how they interpret the universe of social relations  and how well they rationalize

TEEN-AGE CONFIDENTIALITY AND HEALTH CARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/nyregion/teen-age-confidentiality-and-health-care.html,MOUNT KISCO THREE or four years ago a teenage girl walked into the Planned Parenthood center on Main Street here asked for and received birth control pills and left Her mother found them in her drawer Marjorie Liebowitz the clinics director recalled last week and we got a furious letter from her saying that under no circumstances was her daughter to see us again She did come back later pregnant It was an unwanted pregnancy According to Mrs Liebowitz that kind of shock and anger from a mother who did not know her unmarried daughter was receiving familyplanning advice is common People really do kick their kids out of the house Mrs Leibowitz said Arrayed against a generation of parents who may have difficulty accepting increased sexual activity among their children is a wide range of healthcare professionals in the county who may face the loss of Federal funds unless they agree to tell parents when their children have received birthcontrol prescriptions Doctors nurses and a variety of county and private health providers were highly critical last week of the impending change in the Public Health Service Act I think the young people know we respect their confidentiality said Mrs Leibowitz who has four children of her own It has to be that way Without confidentialty healthcare experts say substantial numbers of sexually active youngsters below the age of 18 will stay away from birthcontrol clinics out of fear of parental reprisals or out of a desire to protect the parents from emotional stress Unwanted pregnancies therefore will increase and so will induced abortions they said Proposed changes to Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act would require familyplanning agencies to notify parents within 10 days that birthcontrol devices such as pills intrauterine devices or diaphragms were prescribed to an unemancipated minor  one who is 17 or younger Failure to notify parents could lead to loss of financing Proposed last February the regulations underwent a public comment period that ended April 23 During the period about 40000 pieces of mail arrived at the office of Marjory Mecklenburg acting deputy assistant secretary for population affairs for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services Mrs Mecklenburg said at midweek that it would take at least a month for the mail to be evaluated and the regulations promulgated in their present form in some altered shape or indeed changed at all She said that there was no time limit on the departments options We cant shut parents out said Mrs Mecklenburg a mother of four We want to bring them in Over the long run these regulations can raise more concern among professionals parents and teenagers working together Parents and kids can get back to talking together and thats what familyplanning clinics ought to be doing In the county more than a dozen clinics that dispense birthcontrol prescriptions now accept about 500000 in Title 10 funds The largest number seven belong to Planned Parenthood of Westchester and four others are run by the County Health Department Theyre not going to work Camille Murphy head of the County Office for Women said of the proposed regulations Theyre going to create a lot more problems she said including disintegration of the family Asked if she had encountered supporters of the change Mrs Murphy said I meet some people who are ambivalent Theyre mostly men who say I want to know what my daughters doing I say What about your sons They can buy stuff over the counter They say Oh well thats different  Dr Mary E Lane of the County Health Department told of a recent talk she had made in a White Plains church urging parishioners to register opinions against the regulations in Washington After the wellattended service she said only one couple came up to tell her that they favored the changes because they needed to know anything that was going on as important as this with their young people She said they asked her What are kids this young doing having sex anyway Dr Lane who is against the proposed changes said We know that kids are more sexually active than they used to be and our response as professionals is to attempt to protect them as they grow up Countyrun clinics are in Yonkers White Plains Tuckahoe and Greenburgh Federal financing of about 102000 has been received in the year ending in June Dr Lane said About 2500 new and continuing patients have visited the four clinics she said adding that about 15 percent or 375 are younger than 18 Planned Parenthood of Westchester received about 139000 in Federal funds to help run their seven clinics this year according to Elsie deB Morrison executive director of Coordinated Human Services of Westchester a nonprofit agency that acts as a conduit for Title 10 funds in the county Francine S Stein Planned Parenthoods executive director said the most important feature of the changes would be that youd deter young people from seeking contraceptive care The heart of the issue she said is that there are some young women who can talk to their parents and do But there are some who cant Abusive parents or those who are alcoholics or in poor health Mrs Stein said often fail to carry out the kind of dialogue on such a sensitive subject that teenagers need About 40 percent of the 375 clients that visited the Mount Kisco clinic in March were under 18 Mrs Liebowitz said About 90 percent of them she added have already experienced sexual intercourse by the time they get up their courage to come in Those stairs are hard said Berta Kelly a nurse in the secondfloor clinic where 10 preganancy tests are given  the reason many of the youngsters go A lot of times they say Oh my parents will kill me  Often the youthful clients will leave telephone numbers at a relatives house or an afterschool job so their parents will not find out if the clinic has to make followup calls about medical treatment Mrs Kelly said

PRESIDENT REPORTED SET TO ENDORSE AMENDMENT ON PRAYER IN SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/04/us/president-reported-set-to-endorse-amendment-on-prayer-in-schools.html,President Reagan plans to announce his support of a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing voluntary group prayer in public schools according to White House and Congressional aides Mr Reagan plans to make the announcement on Thursday which he has proclaimed as a National Day of Prayer A senior White House official said today that Mr Reagan would probably recommend precise wording for the proposed amendment rather than simply express his support for one or more of several such measures already introduced in Congress Proponents of schoolsponsored prayer have pressed for a constitutional amendment for two decades since the Supreme Court held in 1962 that organized prayer in public schools was unconstitutional Congress has rejected such proposals five times The Courts 1962 decision and its 1963 ruling outlawing organized Bible readings in the schools were based on the First Amendment clause barring an establishment of religion by Congress The Court has not forbidden voluntary silent prayers or meditation in classrooms Details were not available on what language the amendment would use to express conservatives views that group prayer ought to be allowed in classrooms State Ratification Needed The senior White House official said that the White House policy staff was now drafting the proposed amendment which would require approval by Congress and ratification by 38 states to become part of the Constitution The aide said it had not been decided where or at what time on Thursday Mr Reagan would make the announcement He said the White House liaison office which handles the Administrations relations with religious groups and other interest groups has been asked to find the proper forum In his 1980 campaign Mr Reagan drew strong support from conservative Christian religious groups by declaring his opposition to court decisions banning prayer in public schools In recent speeches he has set the stage for Thursdays announcement by strongly stating his belief that what he describes as voluntary prayer ought to be allowed in the classroom The announcement would be Mr Reagans second move in less than three weeks to keep his promises to the socalled religious right and new right groups who supported him in 1980 White House aides told those groups last year that Mr Reagan would begin to address their key issues this year  opposition to school busing and abortions and support for school prayer and tuitiontax credits for private schools  if they would not press him to put those issues ahead of his economic recovery package on the 1981 legislative agenda But backers of those issues have been growing increasingly anxious for Mr Reagan to act His withdrawal of approval from an Administration plan to give tax exemptions to segregated private schools deepened religious conservatives suspicions that moderate White House aides were guiding Mr Reagan away from keeping his campaign commitments on social issues That was the political backdrop for Mr Reagans proposal of April 15 to grant income tax credits for tuition paid to private schools The planned announcement is one of several signs that the White House and Republicans in general would like to make school prayer an important issue in the 1982 Congressional elections Some Express Surprise Today both Republican political professionals and a conservative religious leader expressed surprise that Mr Reagan had not acted on school prayer before he raised the issue of tuition tax credits Of all their new right issues said a Republican Congressional aide its the strongest About 85 percent of the people are for it You cant hurt yourself there Ron Godwin a spokesman for Moral Majority a religiously oriented political action group said that conservative religious leaders had been hearing for about two weeks that a school prayer announcement was forthcoming But he said conservative religious groups are cautious about celebrating Administration initiatives before they see the exact wording Too often he said the Reagan White House has romantic good intentions of satisfying the right but backs away when the political heat begins to rise He cited the White House reversal on the tax exemption issue as an example White House aides said that Mr Reagan joined the Cabinet Council on Legal Policy recently for a lengthy discussion of the schoolprayer issue The aides said the discussions covered four options for Mr Reagan In addition to a proposed constitutional amendment they included the idea of supporting pending legislation that would limit the Federal courts jurisdiction over school prayer cases The idea of using legal arguments to persuade the Federal courts to change the current law was also discussed a participant in the meeting said Finally there was discussion of appointing judges sympathetic to prayer in the schools he said
NUCLEAR FREEZE: 'JUNK THOUGHT',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/05/opinion/nuclear-freeze-junk-thought.html,I used to see a great deal of complaint a few years ago about junk food Junk food is food that has almost no real nutritional content has a lot of calories and salt to make the eater feel good and might contain additives that are lifethreatening I always thought the problem of junk food was overdrawn To my mind the real problem in our society is not junk food but junk thought That is thought that looks appetizing makes the thinker feel good but is either empty or harmful The best example of junk thought to appear in years is the nuclearfreeze movement It is not that the movement is a joke or frivolous It is deadly important and even frightening but it is junk thought nonetheless There are two basic reasons why the concept of a nuclear freeze as prescribed by Senators Edward M Kennedy and Mark O Hatfield and any number of housewives university professors and students across the United States is bad for you First it is deeply simpleminded and irresponsible Second if carried to its logical extreme it is terrifyingly dangerous Lets begin by saying that no sane person is eager for nuclear war On college campuses across America students are demonstrating to say that they have discovered that nuclear war would be an unspeakable catastrophe Members of Congress have joined in pointing out that nuclear war would end life as we know it But come on people We have known that nuclear war is horrible ever since there have been nuclear weapons For the proponents of the freeze to act as if they had discovered something new is a sign of almost staggering ignorance of the history of the last 37 years For all of that time the United States paramount goal has been to maintain freedom and avoid a nuclear war To imply otherwise is not only specious but insults the speaker as well as the the listener If no one is eager for nuclear war the demonstrators and senators are doing no more than uttering a cliche We do not want nuclear war The nuclear freeze petition signers are uttering a truism that is embarrassingly hackneyed Of course no one wants nuclear war Are the proponents of the freeze doing anything more than satisfying themselves by uttering a momentarily satisfying but empty banality No And thats what makes junk thought Carrying a sign endorsing a cliche is not a moral effort It is joining the incrowd A moral statement might be a question of whether it is fair for the Government to deny abortions to poor women or whether taxpayers should subsidize corporations that are losers in the free market Those concerns have real moral meat on both sides of the bone are not platitudes and require some thought and agony of decision Saying that you do not want the world to end in a nuclear holocaust amounts to saying that the real world of Soviet threats and the horrifying need for a deterrent cannot be faced The proponent of the freeze lives in an alternate reality without those dangers and complexities This is not a useful moral contribution But the nuclear freeze is not only empty mental calories It is dangerous as well To ask the United States to trust the Soviet Union to live up to a treaty banning further increases in nuclear arms is to ask the American people to commit suicide as a free society At this very minute there is proof positive that the Soviet Union is using germ warfare in Southeast Asia in criminal violation of its signature on at least three different treaties The Russians occupy all of Eastern Europe in contravention of the strictest accords at Yalta and at Helsinki They invaded Afghanistan in violation of the most basic international law agreed to by them To believe that they would freeze production and deployent of nuclear arms when to keep building and deploying them would give them nuclear mastery is frighteningly ignorant A nuclear freeze would mean in fact that old devil unilateral United States disarmament The freeze would mean that we were telling the Soviet Union that from now on it would have the whip hand on planet Earth as we inevitably disarmed and the Soviet Union became even more dominant I would like to suggest to those who demonstrate for a nuclear freeze that they contemplate life and death in Cambodia or Vietnam or the Soviet Union if they would like to see just exactly what a Sovietdominated world would be like If the nuclear freeze movement is merely restating platitudes it is condoning an irresponsible abnegation of our societys interest in real problems If it aims at or will result in unilateral disarmament it is deadly Either way it is junk thought  Benjamin J Stein is author of the forthcoming  Ludes A Ballad of the Drug and the Dream
BUSING BILL BACKED BY ADMINISTRATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/us/busing-bill-backed-by-administration.html,The Reagan Administration breaking its long silence on Congressional efforts to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal courts gave its blessing to an antibusing bill today But it warned that a bill to remove the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over school prayer was probably unconstitutional and in any event unwise The Administration transmitted its views to Congress in letters from Attorney General William French Smith to the chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees Members of Congress which is considering more than 30 bills to limit the Federal courts jurisdiction over socalled social issues have been pressing the Administration to take a stand for more than a year Busing Bill Passed by Senate The release of the letters appeared to be timed to coincide with President Reagans public endorsement today of a constitutional amendment to permit organized prayer in the public schools Page B10 The busing measure has already passed the Senate and is the only one of the bills to pass either house It removes the authority of the lower Federal courts to order busing plans for racial balance or for other reasons that involve the transportation of children more than five miles or 15 minutes from home Representative Peter W Rodino Jr chairman of the House Judiciary Committee had refused to consider the measure until he heard from the Administration In his letter to Mr Rodino a New Jersey Democrat Mr Smith said that careful examination of the bills provisions indicates that they are constitutional But whatever comfort that appraisal gave to the Presidents conservative supporters who have criticized the Administration for not pressing the social issues was substantially undermined by the letter on the school prayer bill to Senator Strom Thurmond a South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee That bill would remove the Supreme Courts jurisdiction to review any state action which relates to voluntary prayers in public schools and public buildings While the Attorney General did not flatly declare that such a law would be unconstitutional his 16page analysis strongly suggested that conclusion in language that undercut a theory favored by many conservatives about the power of Congress to restrict the Supreme Courts jurisdiction The theory is that the socalled exceptions clause of the Constitution which sets out the Supreme Courts jurisdiction subject to such exceptions  as the Congress shall make gives Congress wide latitude to strip the High Court of jurisdiction over entire categories of cases school prayer abortion or almost any other area The Attorney General rejected that view in a legal analysis of the school prayer bill based on a belief in a unique and powerful role for the Supreme Court In its way that analysis could be seen as posing at least as great a threat to the political agenda of many conservatives as the Presidents endorsement of the school prayer amendment today was a lift for that agenda a fact suggesting that the timing was designed to allow the two developments more or less to cancel each other out Courts Independence Cited In his letter to Senator Thurmond Mr Smith said that while Congress clearly had some limited authority over the Supreme Courts jurisdiction Congress may not however consistent with the Constitution make exceptions to Supreme Court jurisdiction which would intrude upon the core functions of the Supreme Court as an independent and equal branch in our system of separation of powers The Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts the Attorney General said have occasionally exceeded the properly restrained judicial role envisaged by the framers of our Constitution But he added The remedy for judicial overreaching however is not to restrict the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over those cases which are central to the core functions of the Court in our system of government This remedy would in many ways create problems equally or more severe than those which the measure seeks to rectify He told Senator Thurmond that the Justice Department historically defended all but obviously unconstitutional acts of Congress against legal challenge and added that should the department be called upon to defend the constitutionality of this bill before the courts it responsibly could and would do so But Mr Smith clearly did not want that offer of assistance to be taken as encouragement There are sound reasons that explain why Congress has exercised restraint in this area and not tested the limits of constitutional authority under the exceptions clause he said in the letters final paragraphs The integrity of our system of Federal law depends upon a single court of last resort having a final say on the resolution of Federal questions Analysis of Antibusing Bill Mr Smiths conclusion that the antibusing bill would be constitutional rested largely on the fact that it does not deal with the Supreme Courts jurisdiction but only with the power of the lower courts to order a remedy Noting that the Constitution says nothing about the power of the lower Federal courts the Attorney Genertal told Mr Rodino It seems a necessary inference from the express decision of the framers that the creation of inferior courts was to rest in the discretion of Congress that once created the scope of the courts jurisdiction was also discretionary Mr Smith also said the antibusing bill would survive a challenge under the Constitutions equal protection clause because the bills provisions neither create a racial classification nor evidence a discriminatory purpose The defects in busing noted by proponents of the bill he said would suffice to show that the bill is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose the constitutional test he said the Supreme Court would apply
REAGAN ENDORSES VOLUNTARY PRAYER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/us/reagan-endorses-voluntary-prayer.html,President Reagan saying that he wanted to foster faith in a Creator who alone has the power to bless America announced today that he would propose a constitutional amendment to allow voluntary prayer in public schools No one must ever be forced or coerced or pressured to take part in any religious exercise but neither should the Government forbid religious practice Mr Reagan told about 120 religious and conservative political leaders at a gathering in the White House Rose Garden this afternoon The Supreme Court ruling of 1962 did not outlaw voluntary private prayer by individuals But it did have the practical effect of ending organized group prayer in schools whether the prayer was voluntary or compulsory The President asserted that the Supreme Court ruling had been brought about by wellmeaning people who encouraged what he described as a misguided interpretation of the First Amendment I have never believed that the oftquoted amendment was supposed to protect us from religion he said It was to protect religion from government tyranny Legal Debate Over Wording The First Amendment says in part Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof To become part of the Constitution the proposed amendment would have to be approved by Congress and ratified by the legislatures of 38 states Some representatives of conservative religious groups who attended the Rose Garden ceremony expressed disappointment that Mr Reagan did not tell them today the exact wording of the amendment he would propose White House officials and legal sources said that drafting of the amendment had been delayed by legal debate within the Administration over its language Lawyers for some church groups are warning that inclusion of the words nondenominational and voluntary will leave the amendment open to legal challenge by raising the issues of sect and compulsion For example Federal courts in the past have suggested that school prayer cannot be truly voluntary because students might feel subtle pressure from their peers to participate White House officials regard Mr Reagans stand on school prayer as the most politically popular of his positions on such socalled social issues as school prayer abortion and busing Republican polls are said to show a 75 percent to 85 percent approval rating of voluntary prayer in the classroom Reaction today among religious and civil liberties spokesmen was sharply divided The Rev Jerry Falwell leader of Moral Majority a churchbased conservative political action group said the Presidents stand on the issue was correct both in principle and in political strategy Threat to Constitution Seen Obviously the purpose of the constitutional amendment is to circumvent the Supreme Court and to put it out of their reach Mr Falwell said In my opinion it will be passed because the people want it and I doubt any Congressman or state legislator could oppose religious liberty for the children today when thats what the people want them to have Representative of the opposite pole of opinion was the statement of Norman Dorsen of the New York University Law School who is president of the American Civil Liberties Union Apparently dissatisfied with his destructive impact on the economy Mr Dorsen said the President is now moving to destroy the Constitution He termed Mr Reagans proposal antithetical to fundamental principles of civil liberty as the Supreme Court recognized 20 years ago The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that organized prayer in schools was unconstitutional A 1963 ruling outlawed organized Bible reading The Court has not forbidden voluntary silent prayers or meditation by individuals Most major religious denominations have gone on record in opposition to efforts to restore organized prayer in public schools The opposition arises from a belief that such action violates the principle of the separation of church and state Among those that do not favor the Presidents proposal is the Southern Baptist Convention the nations largest Protestant denomination Most groups that oppose voluntary prayer contend that rather than supporting religion it muddies the issue by prescribing no religion in particular Spokesmen for these groups often express fear that voluntary prayer can be used in subtle ways to promote particular ends
CHANCES INCREASE FOR RAISING OF STATE DRINKING AGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/chances-increase-for-raising-of-state-drinking-age.html,A proposal to raise New York States drinking age to 19 is now expected to come to a vote in the Legislature this year and officials here say that after years of languishing in legislative committees the proposal stands a strong chance of enactment The State Senate Committee on Investigations and Taxation released the drinkingage bill last Tuesday and the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton has said he will not block the measure from going to the floor for a vote In the past Mr Anderson has opposed raising the drinking age the minimum age at which persons may purchase alcoholic beverages because he said that would be miniprohibition He has questioned whether the move would reduce the number of alcoholrelated automobile accidents and fatalities among teenagers But the bill now has 31 sponsors in the Senate  a majority in the 60member body  and the Republican leader is prepared to let it go forward despite any misgivings A proposal for raising the drinking age was first put forward by Governor Carey last February The Governor who in the past has also been against legislation aimed at raising the drinking age switched his position after reviewing new evidence on drunken driving by teenagers The Governor said he was now convinced that raising the drinking age could save a good number of lives Other States Raise Age Proponents of raising the drinking age have pointed out that three of New Yorks neighboring states New Jersey Connecticut and Massachusetts have already raised their minimum drinking ages A bill to raise the drinking age to 19 in Vermont passed the Legislature this year but was vetoed by Gov Richard A Snelling Pennsylvanias drinking age is 21 Those favoring the change have said that unless New York raises its drinking age teenagers from neighboring states with higher drinking ages will drive into New York to buy and drink alcoholic beverages The National Safety Council passed a resolution last January calling for 19 to be made the minimum drinking age nationwide Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink remains undecided on the issue David Langdon a spokesman for Mr Fink said the Speaker wanted to review recent studies on the effect of raising the drinking age on highway fatalities before deciding whether to endorse the present bill Mr Fink and some of his colleagues have questioned whether the state should deny the right to purchase alcoholic beverages to 18yearolds a group upon which the state and the Federal government have placed increasing responsibility Privately however many Assembly Democrats have said they believe that growing political pressure and new evidence on drunken driving by teenagers would result in a vote on the bill A ThreeYear Study Dr Sheila B Blume director of the states Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse recommended last February that the state consider raising the drinking age after a threeyear study by the division showed evidence that raising the age would significantly reduce highway accidents and deaths In addition the study found that 18yearold drivers had the highest rate of alcoholrelated accidents of any age group that outside New York City alcoholrelated accidents result in more than 25 percent of all deaths of 18yearolds and that the accidents involving 18yearold drinking drivers cost the state more than 90 million each year in medical bills State Senator Frank Padavan a Republican of Queens who is the prime sponsor of the drinkingage bill is spearheading other legislation that would affect teenagers Mr Padavan is sponsoring legislation that would require physicians to have parental consent before performing abortions on unwed girls under the age of 18

SENATE'S BUDGET BECOMES PRESIDENT'S PROBLEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/weekinreview/senate-s-budget-becomes-president-s-problem.html,WASHINGTON IT was one of those scenes that remind everyone of where the buck stops Seven Republican Congressional leaders joined President Reagan in the Rose Garden as he announced their new budget proposal Then after posing for photographers the seven hastily withdrew leaving Mr Reagan to face questions about the proposals most politically sensitive component Mr President 40 billion out of Social Security shouted one reporter Wait a minute Mr Reagan implored How can you do it Mr President demanded another journalist As they retreated into the White House Senator Howard H Baker Jr Representative Robert H Michel and the other Republicans looking over their shoulders were smiling broadly Mr Reagan manfully arguing that he wanted to plug Social Security rather than reduce it was not So it went when Mr Reagan bowing to the demands of the Senate Budget Committee waded back into the Social Security swamp The committee on Wednesday voted 20 to 0 against the Presidents original budget for 1983 Later that day White House chief of staff James A Baker 3d and other Reagan advisers were forced to compromise with the panels Republican majority on the alternative budget that was unveiled Thursday afternoon in the Rose Garden The action the first real movement on the budget in months came the day before the news that unemployment had reached 94 percent a postwar high In a radio address yesterday Mr Reagan said the jobless rate would drop if Congress will get off the dime and adopt the deficitreducing budget it now has before it In the new proposal the Presidents men preserved the 10 percent tax cut that has become the standard by which Mr Reagan judges all budget deals But the White House bargainers lacked the muscle to make the Republican senators respect the Presidents wish to defer any action on Social Security until after a Presidential commission completes its study The result of this tradeoff was the plan to find 40 billion in Social Security savings over the next three years  either by tightening benefit payments or by increasing taxes Some Republican political strategists recalling the flood of criticism that forced Mr Reagan to abandon his 1981 plan to cut Social Security were aghast that he had agreed to a compromise that raised the issue anew Democrats immediately seized the weapon that Mr Reagan and the Senate Budget Committee handed them The President proposes to mortgage the future of the elderly to keep alive the folly of his KempRoth tax cut said Senator Robert C Byrd the minority leader The compromise budget which projects a 105 billion deficit in fiscal 1983 brought forth many such allegations that the core problem with the budget and the economy is that Mr Reagans tax cut has crippled the revenue engine of the Government To help offset the drain from the cut the Rose Garden budget proposes 95 billion in unspecified new taxes over the next three years With the unveiling of these new figures Republicans too began questioning the tax cuts high cost Were finally waking up Senator Mark Andrews of North Dakota said to the fact that we cant absorb a 750 billion tax cut However the President is nothing if not a deadgame fighter when it comes to economic theory In the Rose Garden session he insisted the recession would have ended sooner if the Congress hadnt modified the first increment of his tax cut The economic statistics Mr Reagan said indicate that we would be better off economically right now if they had not made us compromise and if the tax cut had been retroactive to January 1 1981 and had been 10 percent not 5 percent in its first year The Rose Garden Got a Workout The White House spent so much of the week trying to forge a new Republican budget that other events merged into a blur But Mr Reagan did find time to assemble 120 religious leaders again in a Rose Garden that is in its spring glory to announce that he would propose a constitutional amendment to authorize prayer in public schools Along with his balancedbudget amendment and his endorsement of tuition tax credits for private school parents this is part of Mr Reagans effort to strengthen his frayed ties with the conservative groups drawn to him by his opposition to busing and abortion and his advocacy of classroom prayer Those groups have grown increasingly restive blaming moderates on the White House staff for keeping their social issues on the back burner For most voters and certainly for Mr Reagans political advisers the budget the economy and in particular Social Security loomed as more important issues That is why White House aides advanced the argument that Mr Reagan agreed to the budget compromise to protect the solvency of the Social Security system grudgingly accepting the plan to find 40 billion in longterm savings in Social Security to head off a Senate Budget Committee effort to impose an immediate freeze on costofliving increases in all entitlement programs It does not cut one dollar in benefits a White House official said of the budget proposal If the Democrats demagogue it too much it will backfire on them In fact the proposal does preserve the 74 percent costofliving increases due in July But at some point down the road  probably after the November election the new budget would require some major fiscal adjustments in Social Security such as raising the retirement age or increasing the payroll tax In the meantime Mr Reagan and his aides will try to sell their argument that such steps do not really amount to a reduction of benefits imposed so that he can finance his tax cut and his military buildup Congressional reaction gives one clue as to how the capitals officeholders think this argument will play Key members of the coalition of moderate Republicans known as the gypsy moths have already informed the White House that it would be politically disasterous for them to support the new budget endorsed by the President
MOTHERS-AND THE BEGINING AND END OF LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/mothersand-the-begining-and-end-of-life.html,I learned just recently when human life begins This question has plagued man through the ages and for centuries it has been the subject of study decisions reconsideration and new conclusions The League of Women Voters is currently presenting information to its members so that a consensus can be reached on what public policy on abortion should be To help with that presentation I have recently read a great deal about fetal life and the decisions that have been made In about 400 BC the pater familias could decide when life began and whether or not a wife could have an abortion In AD 313 theologians followed Aristotles view that the soul developed in three stages and the church considered abortion murder only if it was performed after the soul became rational or animated a time set at 40 days after conception for males and 80 days for females In 13thcentury England jurists decided that the quickening the mothers first perception of fetal movement was the legal beginning of life In 1923 a Wisconsin decision said that a 2monthold embryo is not a human being in the eyes of the law Fifty years later the Supreme Court of the United States found it sufficient because of the inability of those trained in medicine philosophy and theology to arrive at a consensus on the issue to call the compelling point in the fetal life approximately the end of the first trimester Two years after that in 1975 the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments ended 16 months of hearings on about 60 righttolife amendments It had heard testimony from 84 witnesses on both sides including representatives of religious denominations scientists philosophers and physicians All were concerned with deciding when human life begins No decision on that question has yet been made but I am now able to make it I wasnt able to when I started the study Until a few weeks ago when we had a letter from our son Michael who lives in Montana with his wife Mary Anne I was unsure when real life began Now I know A human life begins at exactly the moment when the future grandparents receive word that they are going to have a grandchild Right then the word fetus becomes baby and theres no such thing as uncertainty as to the life of that little bit of humanity
NO MORE DEFICITS-OR ONLY SMALLER ONES?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/weekinreview/no-more-deficits-or-only-smaller-ones.html,WITH the Republicans controlling the Senate and President Reagan now urging public support this year could bring the first full test of of the idea of a balancedbudget amendment to the Constitution  a notion that has been circulating in conservative circles for several years Mr Reagans endorsement in the course of a nationally televised speech on the budget 10 days ago was couched in general terms last week Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul A Volcker in Congressional testimony expressed general sympathy for the idea There is however a specific amendment around approved last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee It is the product of a compromise between Senate sponsors the National Tax Limitation Committee a private antitax group and the National Taxpayers Union another private organization that has been working for passage of petitions by the states to Congress asking that a constitutional convention to adopt a balancedbudget amendment be convened Thirtyone states so far have passed petitions 34 are needed A vote on Senate Joint Resolution 58 is expected on the Senate floor soon Section 1 of the Senate resolution specifies that a planned budget deficit would require the approval of 60 percent of the full membership of each house of Congress Section 2 says that Federal revenues may not grow faster than the economy unless Congress by a majority of the full membership of both houses has passed a bill approving such a rise and the bill has become law Under the amendment Congress can waive these two main provisions if a declaration of war is in effect The Week in Review asked two supporters and two opponents to debate the issues Dennis DeConcini of Arizona is the leading Democratic Senate sponsor Representative Peter W Rodino Jr of New Jersey chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is a chief Democratic opponent in the House William A Niskanen now a member of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers was a founding member of the Tax Limitation Committee Rudolph G Penner a Ford Administration budget economist now at the American Enterprise Institute opposes the amendment Excerpts of their discussion with Edward Cowan an economics correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times and Caroline Rand Herron an editor of The Review follow Question Proponents of an amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget say that its the only way to impose fiscal discipline on Congress  more specifically the best way to cure Congress of deficit budgeting Opponents say that fiscal policy shouldnt be written into the Constitution that an amendment denies Congress the appropriate flexibility to exercise its power to act to promote the general welfare They often cite the need for antirecessionary spending What say you Senator DeConcini Well I would say that if Congress had acted responsibly maybe we wouldnt need this And Administrations  a typical example is this year with a very conservative Republican Administration submitting a budget with a deficit in excess now of 100 billion In 42 of the last 50 years weve had unbalanced budgets Should we have fiscal policy written into the Constitution There are plenty of them in the Constitution about raising taxes the Sixteenth Amendement and the income tax So its nothing that we have never discussed Representative Rodino I believe we should not tinker with the Constitution It provides Congress and the executive with certain responsibilities The fact that over 50 years we have shown that weve been unable to meet those responsibilities does not mean that Congress should then undertake this kind of an amendment which merely is going to be a sham  an easy way out for Congress and the President to say to the American people that we have failed to exercise the will and the discipline that we need Through the budget process we are working in that direction We should not try to suggest that by writing an amendment were going to balance the budget Mr Niskanen Its important to recognize the Constitution includes a great deal of fiscal policy Part of our existing problems are a consequence of our failure to take seriously the Article I Section 8 restraints on the functions the Federal Government may perform Its also important to recognize that the fundamental purpose of the Constitution is to restrain the flexibility of the Government  not to give it unlimited powers The appropriate issue is whether this particular instrument serves the general welfare of the United States rather than whether fiscal policy should be in the Constitution Mr Penner I have no objection to putting fiscal policy in the Constitution if it can be done practically My problem is that I think it difficult to make something workable in the written Constitution if its not also in the unwritten Constitution  if its not part of the mores of the nation The very history that the Senator related shows that the people out there may favor a balanced budget in the abstract but that they think other things are more important Q Isnt the heart of this proposal the simple fixed idea that deficits  small or large  are bad Identifying Deficit Responsibility Senator DeConcini This amendment would not prohibit deficit spending If Mr Penner is right the people really are not ready for this Perhaps he is by the fact that the elected leaders continuously adopt deficits But under the amendment no longer would they be able to without being identified by voting by a threefifths vote to spend the deficit dollars Representative Rodino That threefifths is a difficult figure to try to get on any given issue But remember too that the provision has within it that before every fiscal year there ought to be a statement of outlays and receipts and that this may be revised How long before you consider you need a deficit The thing is so unpredictable it just doesnt make the kind of sense youre trying to Senator DeConcini I can only respond that my constitutional amendment would simply be this  that if the budget was not balanced at the end of the year taxes would automatically be increased across the board That was thrown out because people didnt want an automatic tax and have to go back and explain that But this compromise will work if people abide by the Constitution Generally Congress does Q Is this an antitax amendment in disguise Mr Niskanen The history of this is that it was put together to reflect the proposal being made by the National Taxpayers Union for a balanced budget amendment and the proposal sponsored by the National Tax Limitation Committee which was was basically a spending control Mr Rodino Id like to point out another provision Congress and the President shall insure that actual outlays do not exceed the outlays set forth in such statements How do we get them to insure this Senator DeConcini To me that is one of the strongest statements It is a direction from our Constitution An order  something that cant be any more direct So lets assume as the chairmen suggests that they dont do it There are efforts to go to court by members of Congress to insist that the court tell them to do it OffBudget Taxing and Spending Mr Penner My point is not that Congress would not want to do it My point is that circumstances would arise when simple honest differences of opinion would lead to impossibility of getting the votes to do it And when youd reach an impasse the way to resolve it  if you could would be through logrolling trading votes What this amendment does is make those votes very expensive Indeed since the only currency that Congress can use in such trading is increasing programs I would not be the least bit surprised if this amendment led to higher and more inefficient levels of spending than our current situation It creates an incentive for Congress to try and get resources through ways other than taxing and spending The main candidates would of course be regulation which can be almost an exact substitute for spending in a lot of circumstances Just to give example If they want to run a national health insurance plan they could instead of taxing to raise the money to provide medical service simply pass a law that requires businesses to buy a certain Governmentspecified insurance plan for their workers That sort of activity is even subject to less control than the budget Another device that could be used is the socalled Governmentsponsored agency  things that are not even considered offbudget in our current accounting practices I always call them offoffbudget items Theres no end of the harm you could do by creating such agencies to do all sorts of such things Mr Niskanen Clearly it would increase the incentive to use both some existing and maybe new creative mechanisms that we havent thought about to continue to command resources But at the same timeit can focus the attention of the critics on those forms as well Right now the people who are concerned about the growth of Government have to be concerned about spending taxes regulation monetary policy across the board And the fact that you cant close all of the holes in the dam with one constitutional amendment should not be used as an argument for not closing those that we have some sense of how to Q Would adoption of this amendment tend to drive Government away from commitment to full employment Mr Niskanen That I suppose depends in part on your economic perspective Its important to recognize that the amendment does provide for countercyclical revenue changes after the statement is approved in the sense that if revenues fall as a consequence of recession after the statement is approved an actual deficit will develop Its also important to recognize that the lag in the relationship between the spending increases and the national income would provide for a rough countercyclical spending patter relative to a typical business cycle Representative Rodino As a practical matter havent you economists especially and those who would take care of the fiscal affairs of the country found it almost impossible to agree on what deficits are going to be what the projections are going to be Weve had in the past six months so many varied figures as to what the estimates are going to be Could this provision possibly work Senator DeConcini I always hear  I cant speak for Chairman Rodino I havent heard him say this  members of Congress talking about applying business principles to running our Government The 39some states in this country that have constitutional provisions most of them budget with a surplus Thats what I think would happen here Prudent business practices would have a surplus in your budget process and hopefully you could live within that If you cant there are these escape clauses here that you could go into a deficit Q But many of those states separate operating expenses from capital investment expenses  schools streets bridges waterworks  and budget for them separately permitting specified borrowing for longterm investments which have a payback A question that arises is whether the Federal Government should do that So does a related question Is the Federal Government like any family that must live within its budget Representative Rodino I dont think its like any family Theres question here as to whether with a Constitution providing the obligation of looking after the general welfare we tie our hands and make it impossible to keep those commitments We write provisions in the proposed amendment for emergency and we try to keep it down to a declaration of war But I dont think thats taking into account all the other imponderables Mr Niskanen I think the family budget analogy is most appropriate Sooner or later we must we must tax ourselves to pay for whatever the Government spends This amendment doesnt prohibit deficit spending It makes borrowing a special decision It says when you borrow money you should use a different decision rule than when youre paying for your current outlays Q It does seem as though were talking about a budget thats more in balance not a balanced budget Senator DeConcini That would certainly be a step in the right direction so far as Im concerned Mr Penner Yes that would But the proponents of this amendment owe it to the American people to explain that This thing could work perfectly and even without 60 percent votes you could easily run a whole series of 100 billion deficits simply from the fact that theres no requirement that actual receipts equal the statement receipts Q Senator DeConcini do you have the votes to approve in the Senate Senator DeConcini When the day of reckoning comes theyre there first to cut off filibuster if necessary and I believe to pass the constitutional amendment We have 58 now cosponsors nine more would give us that Q Whats going to happen in the House Representative Rodino A good many of us are going to resist this But there is a great deal of popular sentiment politically it may be very popular But I wonder whether if the people really understood what this was all about what this was an attempt to accomplish whether or not theyd support it And I think that what we have to do is to debate this I intend to do it I believe its my responsibility to go deliberately when we talk about constitutional amendments Q The scissors has another blade  the petitions from the states for a constitutional convention Representative Rodino There are 31 states that have sent in applications to petition the Congress But those applications first of all have to be considered as to their validity I dont think on reflection again that thats what we ought to be anxious about and say because of that we will pass this constitutional amendment Mr Penner Many people are very frightened of such a thing as a consitutional convention Im not sure exactly how wed do it and it would create some uncertainty but I dont understand the fear of it That may not be a bad forum for the debate If people are frightened that theyll pass abortion amendments or suspend the Bill of Rights or whatever else might happen there I dont see that either Because any amendment passed by such a convention has to be ratified by threequarters of the states just as an amendment passed by the Congress Representative Rodino Thats true And you got a long way to go Senator DeConcini There would be a constitutional convention Theyd be outraged at Congress if we didnt have one Representative Rodino You know I respect the outrage of the people And I feel strongly about carrying out the will of the people But I think that we have as servants of the people a responsibility to do the things that we are constrained to do within the limits of the Constitution

BROTHER AND SISTER-MADMAN AND ARTIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/books/brother-and-sister-madman-and-artist.html,LEAH AND LAZAR By Elizabeth Swados 267 pp New York Summit Books 1395 AS a composer songwriter director and choreographer Elizabeth Swados has always been a poet In her scores for theatrical director Andrei Serban The Cherry Orchard Agamemnon she used sounds as musical metaphors for poetic images in the words of the New York Times critic Mel Gussow Besides writing thousands of songs of her own and a musical Runaways which won her an Obie and five Tony nominations Miss Swados who is 30 years old has set to music poems by Sylvia Plath and William Blake composed a musical of Michael Herrs book about Vietnam Dispatches and an opera Lullabye and Goodnight which premiered at the Public Theater this year She has also written and illustrated a childrens book The Girl With the Incredible Feeling Clearly words are no more alien to this eclectic artist critics favorite term for her than the birds cry the crayon or the Indonesian gamelan So it is not surprising that she has now written a novel or that this novel  strange outrageous cryptic sometimes narcissistic  gets its unity and power from its rhythm a rhythm deeper even than language creating the very movement of events As a writer Elizabeth Swados is an intuitive hypnotic musician Leah and Lazar is as its publisher bills it a portrait of the artist as a young woman like many first novels it is apparently also a sort of selfportrait or personal origin myth in which the facts and feelings of the writers past are distorted and transformed Leah  a child who writes songs later a skinny person with long hair guitar and combat boots an impulsive performer of solitary dances  certainly resembles the younger Miss Swados They share locations too an upstateNew York industrial city where poisonous wastes ooze from the ground and spring seems never to come Miss Swados grew up in Buffalo the bucolic Bennington campus rural Appalachia where Leah goes on a workstudy program as her creator did New Yorks grungy East Village of the late 60s and early 70s But Leah can only be understood as half of a double star The other half the dark star that accounts for both her drive and her wobble is her older brother Lazar From childhood Lazar is both Leahs mentor and her tormentor Five years older he is precocious haughty imaginative and already being driven round the bend by his Oedipal burden Never has there been a darker portrait than this one of the Freudian family romance Seen from a childseye view it has the feel of one of those Edward Gorey drawings in which a haggard little girl watches Victorian adults do unspeakable incomprehensible things Mother an ambiguous invalid sits smokes drinks sighs Father a jovial frenetic workaholic is rarely home Lazar seizes the duty of bringing Mother her pills entertaining her deciding whether to let Leah in to see her or not he also screens Leah when Father is home from mysterious quarrels and muffled primal scenes Lazar opened the door a crack He peeked in and then abruptly closed the door again The sweat was pouring down the sides of his face and ears Theyre dancing he said to Leah Dont look   Lazar stands between Leah and life promising and withholding his approval Yet Lazar cant cope with life at all Miss Swados gives us brief excruciating glimpses of his mind a magic carpet of grandiose fantasies over an abyss of terror He falls in love in high school goes mad recovers goes to college goes madder after years of hospitalization he flies to Paris with a suitcase full of medication and his first day there jumps off his hotel balcony and is grotesquely maimed During these same years Leah launches herself into experience with a blind searching intensity She escapes from home to Florida with a Mafia chauffeur who turns her out as a child prostitute the thinnest least convincing chapter of the book she returns north exaggerates her life to impress a Bennington recruiter lives with an older student at college and has an abortion Later she forms a rock band with a blind boyfriend then terrorizes the band Music is demanding  I cant be democratic about it sleeps with a black jazz musician  stupidly stoned and probably a little evil but his music thrilled her is recognized here and there as a genius The maimed and manic Lazar rarely allows her to see him but everything reminds her of him the games of her pimp the fetus in her womb her own ferocious temper Its implicit but obvious that her lifes drive is to please Lazar or to defeat him Finally she simply outlives him because she is an artist and he is a madman and that thin but crucial line between them is what this novel is all about Much of Leah and Lazar is grotesque and extreme and some of it would be insufferable  the way both grown siblings terrorize their parents the welltodo hippie search for Reality Among the Natives  if it werent for a subtle edge of mockery a slight but saving critical distance between the narrator and Leah But what makes the novel stick in the mind with such eerie authority is not its content but its music  an underlying idiosyncratic beat that gets the readers feet tapping to the strangest steps Sleepy sudden flat flowing jerky urgent surefooted and dreamlike Miss Swadoss prose both startles and mesmerizes is plain and exotic at once

CHINA'S BIRTH GOALS MEET REGIONAL RESISTANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/15/world/china-s-birth-goals-meet-regional-resistance.html,A Communist Party official in Guangdong Province was dismissed from his job at a petroleum plant and expelled from the party recently for feudal thinking after he and his wife  they already had six daughters tried once more to produce a son Elsewhere in this coastal province two women were locked up for 15 days as sorceresses for inciting pregnant women at their farm commune to flee from familyplanning workers All but 9 of the 325 women with unauthorized pregnancies were later given abortions and intrauterine devices Those incidents reported by the Canton radio are but two skirmishes in a desperate battle that the provincial authorities have been waging over birth control Harsher reports reaching Hong Kong last summer charged that thousands of pregnant women in eastern Guangdong were rounded up and forced to have abortions Family planning officials deny that such Draconian tactics are being used But they acknowledge that there is stubborn resistance among Guangdongs 588 million inhabitants to the national goal of a onechild family An expanding population is the biggest obstacle that China confronts in its push to modernize itself With close to one billion people China accounts for 23 percent of the worlds population but has only 7 percent of its arable land It is estimated that 30 percent of Chinas national income has been spent raising those born since the Communist takeover in 1949 China has adopted a stringent birth control policy Yet a baby is born in China every two seconds With half of the population still under 21 years old a worrisome new baby boom looms as more Chinese approach marriageable age China hopes to hold its population to 12 billion by the year 2000 but national family planning officials like Chen Muhua have expressed apprehension over whether this target can be met Graced with a lush terrain and warm climate Guangdong Province is one of Chinas three most densely populated provinces Its population exceeds that of France though it is little more than a third as large After Mao Zedongs assurance that a large population was a good thing Guangdong reached a staggering 44 percent annual growth in 1962 This has since been brought down but it still failed to hold to last years goal of 13 percent instead exceeding 15 percent Compared with a growth of 14 percent in all of China last year the population of the United States rose by less than 1 percent and that of the Soviet Union by eighttenths of 1 percent The populations of all three countries have roughly doubled over the last 60 years but only in China because of the large number of people involved has birth control been adopted as an official policy The population of China grew from an estimated 476 million in 1920 to 971 million in 1980 in an area of 38 million square miles In comparison the United States with an area of 302 million square miles had a population of 227 million in 1980 The Soviet Union with an area of 86 million square miles had a population of 265 million that year Incentives and Penalties Discussing the continuing increase in population in China Li Hanbo the deputy director of Guangdongs family planning program said One of the reasons for a high growth rate is that we have too many families having three or more children Last year he said only 27 percent of families took the pledge to have just one child while 24 percent already had three children or more Local legislation augmenting the national family planning directives has given Guangdong some of the strongest incentives and penalties in China Late marriages are encouraged for example and students who marry face expulsion from school Counties and municipalities set annual quotas for the number of babies who may be born A couple wanting a child must apply for an allotment with women who marry late getting first priority Couples taking the pledge to have just one child are issued pocketsize plasticbound certificates entitling them to priority for housing and medical care and their child to free kindergarten schooling and health care If they have a second child they must reimburse the Government for all the benefits and bonuses The system works best in the overcrowded city of Canton where Mr Li said 90 percent of families have just one child and very few have three children Mobilizing the Whole Family In Cantons downtown district of Yuexiu Huang Pei the local family planning director said that nearly 94 percent of the women of childbearing age were limiting themselves to one child Consulting her small blue notebook she noted that her district recorded 951 abortions last year of which at least 80 were beyond the fourth month of pregnancy Asked whether abortions were allowed even in the final month of pregnancy she said It happens Miss Huang said her teams conduct painstaking and careful ideological work 10 or even 20 times on a person to dissuade a mother from having another child We mobilize everyone in the family not just mothers and fathers but also brothers sisters and so forth the district director said Zhang Zhi director of the Wuyang Electric Fan Factory said his 263 employees of childbearing age had been allocated the right to have 18 babies this year Weve had two so far and five more women are pregnant Mr Zhang said Among its other incentives he said the factory rewarded single children of employees with cash presents on holidays In the countryside the situation is just the other way around sighed Mr Li Peasants have clung to a tradition of having large families to help them in the fields and to support them in old age The biggest problem is the old habits and customs of 7000 years explained Miss Huang They put too much emphasis on having sons Undercut by Recent Policies Mr Li conceded that family planning had been undercut by recent changes in agricultural policy that paid farmers more if they produced more In Guangdong as elsewhere in China this has made having children profitable again Without the former policy of work points Mr Li said production brigades and teams have no way to punish them if they have more children He added Farmers feel that the land belongs to them and children belong to them too so they can have as many as they want Peasants are tacitly allowed to have two children but not three Many families in the countryside want a second child if the first is a girl Mr Li explained Our provincial office shows great sympathy because they do have a practical problem It is difficult for the family to manage if there is only one girl We have not proclaimed this as a policy but if it happens in the grass roots we would not object But if the second child is also a girl they have to accept it Mr Li said family planning workers commonly spent three or four months persuading a couple not to have more children On the average each person takes 10 times to be persuaded Mr Li said The most difficult person can take up to 100 times On their visits he said some workers were cursed or even beaten up by peasants The authorities have been accused of playing rough in return Last July Zhengming a Hong Kong publication sympathetic to the Peking Government gave what it said were details of a ruthless struggle under way in Guangdongs Huiyang prefecture to cut the number of expected babies by 47000 Zeal of Local Officials A reporter from Zhengming who visited eastern Guangdong reported how vigilantes abducted pregnant women on the streets and hauled them off sometimes handcuffed or trussed to abortion clinics Other women he said were locked in detention cells or hauled before mass rallies and harangued into consenting to abortions The reporter referred to aborted babies which were actually crying when they were born Zhengming attributed such coercion to the zeal of local officials pushing to meet their quotas rather than to explicit directives from above It noted that the desired results of achieving 47000 fewer births went conspicuously unreported by Southern Daily Cantons party newspaper Mr Li said enemies of family planning had exaggerated or distorted the facts He cited a case in Enping county in which two policemen hitched a ride with a truck carrying women off to a clinic to get contraceptives and this was misunderstood by spectators In Dongguan county he said a young man seeing pregnant women going off for abortions had tugged at the arm of a plump friend though she wasnt pregnant and this joke started rumors There is no question of forcing pregnant women to have an abortion Mr Li said We first persuade them to take contraceptive measures so they will not produce more children If they have just one child after marriage its reasonable We deal mostly with couples having two children After three children we demand that they take sterilization measures If they refuse we must devote more time and more people to come to them A Few Stubborn People Mr Li referred to a few stubborn people refusing to do what should be done adding If we dont take harsh measures the majority would not be happy about it Those with one or two children can have their wages cut 10 percent or more if they keep having children There have been reports of recalcitrant couples having their electricity and water cut off The authorities are even empowered to seize the family television set bicycle or sewing machine We set a time limit Mr Li said If they fail the punishment will be upgraded If some families cant afford cash we will take away their property because if we are not severe on these people the majority will not be satisfied Even so he said some peasants feel that the potential earning power of sons could offset any financial penalties Of some 7 million women of childbearing age in Guangdong 600000 had reported abortions last year Unofficial estimates indicate that abortions exceeded the number of live births A Canton physician told a foreigner of abortions being performed on the delivery table But a single or double intrauterine coil of stainless steel wire is the most prevalent birth control device After being fitted at local clinics some women have tried to take the coils out In Longchuan county Mr Li said one womans husband tried to remove the device and she began hemorrhaging so badly that she had to be rushed to the hospital We deliberately publicized the incident to warn other people he said Sterilization Is Promoted Attempts to promote sterilization have been more successful with women than with men At the Daxin Handicrafts Factory in Canton Zhang Yunfang head of the local womens organization said the factory director and the party secretary both women set a very fine example for the employees by undergoing sterilization They were followed by 29 other women and one man In the feudal system of imperial China they had eunuchs in the courts Mr Li said So some men feel that sterilization will affect their sex life The women also worry that their mans physical health will be affected This year the growth target for Guangdong is again 13 percent slightly higher than the 12 percent national rate and officials will feel even more pressure to meet it by whatever means The alternative officials like Li Hanbo point out is a runaway population subsisting on resources insufficient to maintain let alone improve the living standard Mr Li observed that it cost more to prevent a birth in Guangdong than to raise a rural child to the age of 15 an expense reckoned at about 865 The hope in the countryside he said is to get half of the families to have only one child and the rest not to have three or more Though thats the case the ideological work is still hard Mr Li said There are still cases of some families having four five six children and even more Some party workers he reported say that we have had many difficult things since liberation but this is the most difficult
HOW MILITANT FEMMINISTS ARE KILLING THE E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/nyregion/how-militant-femminists-are-killing-the-era.html,IN THE last eight years or so I have found myself cast in the very unwelcome role of adversary to the loudly proclaimed but very deceptive womens movement And it looks like we adversaries are about to accomplish what many I suspect find rather unforgivable stopping passage of the equal rights amendment Rather a remarkable achievement really when you think about it Within a year of its proposal in Congress in 1972 30 states had already ratified the amendment  mostly it must be said without hearings study or debate The New Jersey Legislature passed it by voice vote the first year three years later when the people had a chance to express themselves the amendment was voted down The same thing happened in New York In the allotted six more years before its time limit in 1979 five other states had ratified the measure leaving only three more to reach the 38 needed to make it a constitutional amendment Then in 1978 with one year left and time running out by then five of the ratifying states had rescinded their ratification Congress quite illegally extended the ratification period for three more years by a majority vote whereas the same twothirds vote necessary to propose the amendment is required for extension The time limit is now up on June 30 In addition to such help from Congress amendment proponents have been able to depend on the lavish support of two Presidents  Gerald R Ford and Jimmy Carter  and all the economic aid and political clout that their wives and their Administrations could supply Even extraordinary attention and onesided promotion by the American press have failed to convince the American public that the amendment deserved passage If all this sounds like gloating it is not The strange and sad part of the whole unhappy recent history of womens rights is that most of us women who oppose the amendment consider ourselves feminists I say sad and unhappy for us because it truly has been that  and I would add frustrating I am convinced that most women in this country would gladly have joined the equal rights amendment movement and I am further convinced that it would have been passed five years ago if its proponents had stuck to basic issues truly relative to womens rights equal education equal opportunity equal pay Alas it did not something each woman learned in her own way I went to my local Y in Westfield to attend a meeting of the National Organization for Women ready and eager to be part of this great feminist wave of the 1970s What I heard at that and subsequent meetings was an almost total preoccupation with abortion rights You may not agree with me when I say that I perceive abortion to be the very antithesis of true feminism but I think you might agree that it was bad tactics to include abortion rights in the feminist agenda Its just too alienating and divisive an issue Betty Friedan the founder of NOW saw this in the beginning As I recall she even tried to explain this at the International Womens Year conference in Houston in 1978 but was hooted down with catcalls and jeers until she abruptly announced that she would go along with the agenda Her instincts were correct The militant feminists running the show made their position clear regarding how important abortion rights were to qualifying as a feminist when they kicked Pat Goltz an early and ardent feminist out of NOW for her antiabortion position so much for the vaunted right to choose Mrs Goltz went on to found Feminists for Life in Ohio She and I find ourselves in good company when we say that if a womans value is intrinsic and not to be based on her wantedness by someone else the life of an unborn child has intrinsic worth and should not depend on wantedness by another This principle was first articulated by the earliest feminists in 1923 who were unequivocally against abortion In a letter to the Womens Lobby in 1977 Clare Booth Luce the author playwright and diplomat wrote in part I have been a supporter of ERA for 55 years Indeed I went to work in Washington for Alice Paul the mother of the ERA the year the amendment was sent up to The Hill But I do not accept the extraordinary proposition that women cannot achieve equal rights before the law until all women are given the legal right to empty their wombs at will and at the expense of the taxpayer Abortion is the very antithesis of feminism Real feminism stands for equal rights for all and that must include unborn babies Women have deeply and rightly resented it when male society sees us as objects to be overpowered and then discarded But isnt that just what abortion does by claiming our right to destroy our unborn child By accepting abortion women deny their own worth Bearing children is undeniably part of being female and we must demand to be accepted equally as such Daphne de Jong makes an apt analogy when she reminds us that American Negroes got nowhere so long as they were content to ape the white middle class and she gives the example of straightening their hair Equality began to become a reality for them only when they insisted on acceptance of their different qualities Thats what Black Is Beautiful means The womb is not the beall endall of a womans existence But it is the physical center of her sexual identity which is an important aspect of her selfimage and personality To reject its function or to regard it as a handicap a danger or a nuisance is to reject a vital part of her own personhood Every woman need not be a mother however unless every woman can identify with the potential motherhood of all women no equality is possible Women will gain their rights only when they demand recognition of the fact that they are people who become pregnant and give birth  and not always at convenient times  and that pregnant women have the same rights as others Abortion is antiwoman in that it encourages the playboy ethic It is certainly no accident that one of the strongest supporters and backers of the abortion movement is Hugh MHefner and his Playboy empire The Playboy philosophy treats women as things In this view women exist only for the pleasure of men and are to be discarded if they are stupid enough to get pregnant To the playboy abortion on demand is good  not because it liberates women but because it reduces their inhibitions about being somebodys plaything It takes two sexes to make a pregnancy To define it as one of womens rights has the ironic effect of making fatherhood secondary And this idea is not being lost on American men either The idea that womens bodies and the fruits thereof are solely womens business has led to a gradual abdication by young men of responsibility for the young life they have sired One of the goals of feminism should be shared responsibility of men and women for the children they conceive A very recent court case highlights just how far todays feminist Mafia will go to discourage men from this very concept Last Oct 2 the United States Court of Appeals upheld a Florida statute requiring women seeking abortions to first notify their spouses provided they are not either separated or estranged from them The decision aroused a storm of protest from feminist groups who labeled it sexist The inconsistency here is staggering For years womens liberation has been calling for an end to stereotyped sex roles It also stressed that men too should have the satisfaction and rewards of childbearing but only it would seem if the woman allows it This kind of attitude discourages responsible fatherhood The demand for abortion then is a sellout to the wrong male values the Playboy values and a capitulation to Playboy styles rather than a radical attempt to renegotiate the terms by which women and men can live together in the world as people with equal rights and opportunities Lastly I see abortion as antiwoman because it provides a quickfix solution that leaves untouched the social evils that lead to it It maintains the status quo and jeopardizes many reforms sought by the womens movement as a whole Accepting shortterm solutions like abortion only delays the implementation of real reforms like decent maternity and paternity leaves job protection highquality child care and community responsibility for dependent people of all ages Well why cant you be against abortion and still support the equal rights amendment Because its passage would secure and promote abortion rights and my guess is that most women who oppose the amendment have made the same connection between the two that I have As former Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina probably the leading constitutional lawyer in the United States said I think there is no doubt of the fact that the ERA would give every woman a constitutional right to have an abortion at will Women who are leading the feminist movement have made the same connection As former Representative Bella S Abzug of New York put it Our goal is to enforce the constitutional right of females to terminate pregnancies that they do not wish to continue A court case in Hawaii offers proof of the amendmentabortion connection In 1977 two physicians Dr John Gato and Dr George Sprangler sued for reimbursement for the performance of elective abortions They claimed that this right rested on the Hawaii Constitutions Equal Rights Amendment and they presented the following argument Applicants first claim to reimbursement as a matter of right rests on the Hawaii Constitutions guarantees of due process and equal protection and Article 1 Sec 21 which provides that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the state on account of sex  The proposed Federal amendment has the same language Abortion is a medical procedure performed only for women the doctors argued Withdrawing financing abortions while continuing to reimburse other medical procedures sought by both sexes or only by men would be tantamount to a denial of equal rights on account of sex This clearly establishes the link between the amendment and abortion and I agree with Clare Booth Luce whom I will quote once more from that same letter to the Womens Lobby  I do not care to be identified with a campaign that has already done so much to jeopardize the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment If ERA fails as I now fear it will a large part of the blame must fall on those misguided feminists who have tried to make the extraneous issue of unrestricted and federally funded abortions the centerpiece of the Equal Rights struggle
CHIPPING AWAY AT FREEDOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/opinion/chipping-away-at-freedom.html,Despite the Reagan Administrations assertion that it wants to cut back the power over peoples lives that the Federal Government excercises in fact in key areas it has moved in precisely the opposite direction To be sure the business community has been promised less Federal oversight by regulatory agencies so that many companies may pursue mergers or pricing policies that previously had been given close scrutiny The new freedom also enables businesses to pursue sharp practices that formerly were inhibited But ordinary citizens particularly the weak and the poor are not as lucky For them the Reagan Administrations policies mean less freedom rather than more That is true because the chief danger to a citizens freedom in this country has come not from the administrative bureaucracy that is the target of President Reagans barbs but rather from state governments that have enacted racist laws or enforced racist policies from local governments that have restrained free speech and from police authorities state and Federal that have ignored constitutional limitations on their actions However the power of the Federal Government particularly that of Federal courts has been brought to bear to counter such repressive actions Congress has passed a series of laws expanding the use of Federal courts to counter discrimination based on race sex and age The courts have allowed prisoners mental patients students and the handicapped to sue government when their basic rights have been violated Principles of due process and equal protection under the law have been expanded Recipients of government benefits have been afforded hearings to contest arbitrary and unreasonable withdrawal of those benefits Our society has also built up other quasigovernmental institutions  for example legalaid offices and publicinterest groups  to act as allies spokesmen and representatives of citizens fighting the actions of government What the Reagan Administration proposed to do is to destroy these checks and balances against government overreaching and against private discrimination toward the poorest and weakest members of society Although the Administration would not change the United States Surpeme Courts appellate jurisdiction it would limit the jurisdiction of lower Federal courts in certain circumstances where the courts have stood in firm defense of individual freedom It would change basic rules under which our liberites have been guaranteed  for example it seeks to eliminate the exclusionary rule a rule that prohibits the use in court of illegaly seized evidence as a protection of individual privacy against police intrusion It would amend and restrict civil rights laws that allow suits by private persons against government It would gut legalservice programs It would stop government payment of counsels fees to publicinterest lawyers removing an important incentive for lawsuits against government Furthermore the Reagan Administration would amend the Freedom of Information Act and already has changed the classification rule to withdraw much information about the Government from public scrutiny It has already given the Central Intelligence Agency power to operate in the United States These are hardly the actions of an Administration that is trying to cut back on the power of the Federal bureaucracy In the name of family protection the Reagan Administration would inject the Government into the most private decisions of people by seeking to eliminate abortions and by refusing contraceptive information to teenagers without parental knowledge and permission The Family Protection Act which the Administration announced that it supports would give parents almost tryannical control over their children by exempting the parents from the reach of childabuse laws when they imposed discipline or corporal punishment on their children This is still another example of how the removal of Government power does not necessarily mean freedom but can simply lead to a different kind of oppression The act also prohibits Federal funds from being used to promote educational materials that do not contribute to the American way of life as it has been historically understood  an invitation to rewrite all textbooks in the conservative mold As usual the use of labels can be a method of deception The Administration proposes to restrain those branches and programs of the Federal Government that have been most protective of individual freedom Its notion of justice is not to remove Federal power evenhandedly but only to withdraw that power where it has done the most good Leon Friedman professor of law at Hofstra Law School is a member of the executive council of the Committee for Public Justice a civil rights organization
ATTACKS ON FEDERAL COURTS COULD SHIFT HISTORIC ROLES; Courts on Trial,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/us/attacks-on-federal-courts-could-shift-historic-roles-courts-on-trial.html,First of four articles on efforts to restrain the Federal judiciary By STUART TAYLOR Jr The Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts are under the most potent attack in recent history an attack that is coming from many conservatives in Congress and to a lesser extent from the Reagan Administration If successful the assault could produce a fundamental shift in the Governments system of checks and balances What distinguishes many of the more than 30 proposals pending in Congress to curb the courts powers to interpret constitutional rights is that they would bypass the timehonored but cumbersome process of amending the Constitution Disagreement With Rulings The proposals some of which are gathering momentum are fueled by disagreement with some of the Supreme Court rulings in recent decades that have profoundly changed American life and given the Federal courts a larger role in governing the nation Among the most controversial are those requiring busing as a means of desegregating public schools declaring the right of women to have abortions prohibiting statesponsored prayer in public schools and expanding the rights of criminal defendants Critics such as Senator Jesse A Helms Republican of North Carolina say that such decisions have plunged the Federal courts deep into debates over social policies that should be resolved by elected officials and have involved judges in running schools and other institutions they are neither authorized nor competent to manage But David R Brink president of the American Bar Association says the legislation before Congress and the inevitable legal challenges to it could be compared to a missile that could plunge us into internal strife and destroy our rights and lead to the most serious constitutional crisis since our Civil War What is ultimately at stake may be whether elected officials are to take away the Federal courts historical supremacy in deciding what the Constitution means and their power to order other branches of Government to do what they say it requires President Reagan and Attorney General William French Smith have harshly attacked various Supreme Court decisions and judicial activism in general But on May 6 the Reagan Administration ended its long silence on specific efforts to curb the courts While Mr Smith gave his qualified blessing to an antibusing bill he expressed serious reservations about other legislation to limit the Supreme Courts jurisdiction At the same time President Reagan publicly endorsed a constitutional amendment to permit organized prayer in the public schools Upholding High Courts Role The argument against the school prayer bill was based on Mr Smiths belief that there should be no interference with the Supreme Court because of its unique role in the nations system of government The remedy for judicial overreaching he said is not to restrict the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over those cases which are central to the core functions of the Court in our system of government The endorsement of the antibusing bill was based in large part on Mr Smiths view which is disputed by other lawyers that it limits only the lower Federal courts He believes that the legislation does not prohibit all busing or restrict in any way the Supreme Courts power to use any measures it deems necessary to desegregate schools There is heated argument about the constitutional issues involved in the debate on curbing the courts powers which center on what lawyers call jurisdiction the judicial power to decide legal disputes Historically it is by ruling on individual cases brought before them that the courts have made their own interpretations of the Constitution into the law of the land and have created precedents that bind other branches of government Article III of the Constitution authorizes Congress to create and presumably to abolish or limit lower Federal courts and grants the Supreme Court jurisdiction over state and Federal appeals with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make There is no agreement among scholars or judges on whether these provisions were intended to grant Congress a potentially alldevouring power to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction to decide any issue or type of case that Congress chooses to declare off limits Warnings on Crippling Courts Some prominent conservatives like Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona have joined with liberals and the legal establishment in warning that legislation to curb the courts could cripple their ability to check the excesses of popular rule could make the protections written into the Constitution a dead letter and could subject the liberties of all Americans to a tyranny of the majority Some opponents also say that the proposed legislation would create new problems by shifting jurisdiction over issues back to state courts They argue that such a change would merely politicize constitutional principles by moving the power to decide the disputed issues from Federal judges who are appointed for life and thus not subject to pressure from voters to state judges who in many cases are elected Many state supreme court justices have indicated that they would still be bound by their oaths of office to follow United States Supreme Court precedents on school prayer busing and abortion no matter what Congress did Their interpretations would be likely to vary however making it almost inevitable that the Federal Constitution would come to have conflicting meanings in different states And Congress or the state legislatures might impose new limitations on the jurisdiction of state courts that make unpopular decisions Public Attitudes Toward Court On some issues in particular busing and school prayer public opinion polls show widespread disapproval of what the Supreme Court has done For example a Louis Harris poll early last year found that 74 percent of those surveyed were opposed to busing their children to another part of town for desegregation purposes But in a New York TimesCBS News poll in March concerning public attitudes toward the Supreme Court only 17 percent of the respondents said the Supreme Court has taken too much power while 39 percent said the Court is carrying out its proper responsibilities The antibusing measure endorsed by Attorney General Smith was passed by the Senate March 2 The vote of 57 to 37 ended an eightmonth filibuster and inspired some apocalyptic oratory by opponents of the measure which would prohibit lower Federal courts from busing students more than 5 miles or 15 minutes from their homes for desegregation purposes Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas the sole Senator from the Deep South to oppose the antibusing measure said he did not like busing but wanted his children to know that the beginning of the end of constitutional guarantees in this nation occurred over my strenuous and vehement protest Under the precedent set by the antibusing bill Mr Bumpers warned if the public opinion polls were running strongly enough Congress could deny Federal courts jurisdiction over cases involving freedom of worship freedom of the press freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and the list goes on and on The bill is now in the House where Democratic leaders who oppose it are under mounting pressure to bring it to a vote In the Senate Mr Helms and other conservative leaders are pushing for action on antiabortion and school prayer bills They also want the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee for restrictions even more drastic than those in the bill the Senate passed in March on judicial power to desegregate schools Such measures would require only a simple majority in each house In contrast a constitutional amendment would require a twothirds majority in each house and ratification by 38 states An earlier bill to prevent the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts from hearing cases involving voluntary school prayer was passed in the Senate in April 1979 by a vote of 51 to 40 It died in the House Overruling High Court on Abortion An antiabortion proposal sponsored by Senator Helms seeks to overrule directly the Supreme Courts 1973 decision that women have constitutional rights to have abortions The proposal would define an unborn fetus as a person protected by the 14th Amendment Senator Helms and his allies say the bill is within Congresss power granted by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce by appropriate legislation the amendments provisions Many scholars consider the Helms bill unconstitutional They say Congress cannot take away rights that the Supreme Court has said were granted by the 14th Amendment The bills constitutionality is questioned even by such antiabortion senators as Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah who supports a constitutional amendment to immunize antiabortion laws from Supreme Court review But President Reagan hinted support for the Helms bill in an April 5 letter to Senator Helms and other Congressional leaders expressing hope that Congress this year would enact legislation that would restore protection of the law to children before birth Impact of Fall Elections While the odds still seem to be against enactment of antibusing legislation or other major restrictions on the courts powers this year largely because Congresss agenda is dominated by economic issues and this falls elections the battle may just be beginning If the elections produce a further shift to the right in the balance of power in Congress a series of major restrictions on the courts could follow If the Supreme Court were to uphold such legislation it would set a precedent that might pave the way for the eventual destruction of its powers to review the constitutionality of legislation If it were to strike such legislation down it might provoke a dangerous popular and Congressional reaction Congress might strike back by adopting more sweeping attacks on the Federal courts powers Plans to Amend Constitution Waiting in the wings for such a time are proposals to amend the Constitution to provide for popular election of Federal judges and to make it easier for Congress to expel unpopular Federal judges from office abolishing the life tenure they have enjoyed since 1789 It has long been established that Congress has no power short of a constitutional amendment to overturn judicial interpretations of the Constitution directly by statute But some law professors including Martin H Redish of Northwestern University Law School believe Congress does have broad powers to bar the Federal courts from deciding cases involving enumerated constitutional issues Others including Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School and Lawrence G Sager of New York University Law School disagree strongly They say that nothing in the Constitution was designed to empower Congress to render the courts impotent to give effect to constitutional rights Still other scholars and apparently Attorney General Smith say that Congress may strip the jurisdiction of lower Federal courts if it wants to but not that of the Supreme Court Judiciary Labeled Imperial Advocates of statutory curbs on the Federal courts such as Senator John P East of North Carolina are virtually all conservatives unhappy about what they consider liberal activist policymaking by unelected judges They say it is necessary to return to the elected branches the powers that Federal judges in their view have unconstitutionally usurped They accuse what some call the imperial judiciary of meddling destructively in the management of school systems election procedures criminal courts jails prisons mental hospitals and welfare programs all over the country of coddling criminals scorning public opinion and majority rule and arrogating to themselves a wideranging veto power over actions of the Federal state and local governments Absolute power corrupts absolutely Senator East wrote in a recent article and absolute judicial power is even harder than absolute legislative or executive power to reconcile with any theory of government by the consent of the governed But Congressional restrictions on the courts are strongly opposed by liberals civil libertarians and moderates by most of the judges and legal scholars who have spoken or written on the subject as well as by some prominent conservatives Applauding Supreme Court Many agree with Archibald Cox chairman of the lobby Common Cause who applauds Supreme Court decisions such as those desegregating schools reapportioning state legislatures and improving prison conditions as necessitated by gross violations of fundamental rights and derelictions of duty by the elected branches of the state and Federal governments Meanwhile Senator Goldwater joined by Robert H Bork a leading conservative constitutional scholar who was recently appointed to the Federal appeals court in Washington by Mr Reagan and other leading conservatives have assailed the Supreme Court for taking undue liberties with the Constitution But they have warned that the proposed Congressional cure would be worse than the judicial disease They fear a trend that could make Congress and state legislatures allpowerful putting the civil liberties of all Americans the rights of members of minority groups freedom of the press and the institution of private property up for grabs every time there is an election And they say Congressional curbs on the courts could rebound against their conservative sponsors if the political tides turn pointing out that the last great threat to the Supreme Courts authority came from the political left That was in 1937 when President Franklin D Roosevelt who thought the Court was too solicitous of propertied interests and too hostile to his collectivist New Deal legislation tried to pack the Court by expanding its membership from nine to 15 and adding Justices sympathetic to his views What Will It Be Next In my view the Supreme Court has erred Mr Goldwater said in a floor speech March 17 But we should not meet judicial excesses with legislative excess Now it is busing and abortion and prayer But what will it be next Will a majority lay hold of Congress who puts all actions of the Internal Revenue Service beyond judicial scrutiny If there is no independent tribunal to check legislative or executive action Senator Goldwater concluded all the written guarantees of rights in the world would amount to nothing The Supreme Court has been embroiled in political controversy at least since 1803 when Chief Justice John Marshall first established the power of judicial review in Marbury v Madison by striking down an act of Congress as inconsistent with the Constitution Most Powerful Court in History Since then the Court has become the most powerful court in history restrained only by its own interpretations of the Constitution and laws and by the power of Congress and the states to overrule particular decisions by constitutional amendment a power that has been exercised only three times The Constitution is what the judges say it is Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes once remarked This gives the Court an ambivalent role in the American system The political legitimacy of judicial review rests on the premise that the Court does not make law but finds it serving as a neutral adjudicator of disputes applying legal rules that the drafters of the Constitution or Congress created But there is also evidence that the framers intended the Federal judges who serve for life and whose salaries cannot be cut to act as independent checks on majority rule by applying a higher law of fundamental rights thought to be embedded in the Constitution but not always articulated with clarity in its majestic generalities Attacks by Many Presidents Like President Reagan Presidents Jefferson Jackson Lincoln Franklin Roosevelt and Nixon all assailed Supreme Court rulings that offended them and Congress has periodically considered measures to overturn such rulings But the possibility that the elected branches of Government will attempt major restrictions on judicial power looms larger now than at any time since the defeat of Roosevelts effort Since the 1950s when under Chief Justice Earl Warren the Court began handing down major decisions expanding the constitutional rights of individuals and the powers of the courts the Court has been under attack from conservative scholars and politicians for usurping the powers of elected officials The unanimous decision in 1954 in Brown v Board of Education striking down state school segregation laws spurred massive resistance in the South and efforts by conservatives in Congress to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction to enforce it Decisions on Free Speech Similar unsuccessful efforts followed the Courts decisions in the late 1950s protecting the free speech rights of political dissidents from antisubversive laws and contempt of Congress proceedings and in the early 1960s requiring reapportionment of legislatures on a one man one vote basis During and after Chief Justice Warrens tenure the Court has vastly expanded the Federal courts veto power over the actions of state and local governments ruling that the postCivil War Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated almost all of the more specific provisions of the Bill of Rights which had originally been intended to limit only the Federal Government It has prohibited statesponsored prayer in schools required states to provide indigent criminal defendants with free lawyers put strict limits on police interrogation of criminal suspects and searches and seizures for evidence nullified state death penalty laws expanded free speech and free press rights restricted libel and obscenity laws and struck down dozens of state and Federal laws discriminating against racial minorities aliens and women Lower Federal courts around the country have built on Supreme Court precedents to involve themselves deeply in such matters as nude dancing in bars residential zoning procedures for cutting off welfare benefits and dress and hair codes in schools Departing From Precedents Some have taken over schools prison systems and mental hospitals when they found it necessary to stop violations of constitutional rights Many of the Supreme Courts most controversial decisions in the past 30 years including Brown itself departed from the Courts precedents They interpreted vague constitutional phrases such as the guarantees of due process of law and equal protection of the laws in ways that seemed more in keeping with the personal preferences of the Justices who wrote the opinions than with the ascertainable intentions of the men who wrote the Constitution While the Supreme Court has become more conservative since Chief Justice Warren E Burger took office in 1969 and has cut back on some of the Warren Courts innovations it has reaffirmed most of them and expanded upon others as in the 1973 abortion decision and in several decisions upholding desegregation through busing Future of Efforts to Curb Courts If Senator Helms and his allies succeed in their efforts to overturn or undermine the Supreme Courts rulings on school desegregation abortion and school prayer the focus of the attack is widely believed likely to shift to many other innovations of the Warren and Burger Courts Reapportionment the expanded rights of criminal defendants limitations on libel laws and the concept that the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to state governments have all been questioned by conservative theorists It is not clear where the logic of the campaign to curb the courts would stop once a precedent for doing so was established We could give them all of the jurisdiction we wanted to Senator East said in Senate debate recently and we could take it all away Tomorrow School Desegregation

STATE JUDGES ARE SHAPING LAW THAT GOES BEYOND SUPREME COURT; Courts on Trial; Last of four articles on efforts to restrain the Federal judiciary.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/19/us/state-judges-are-shaping-law-that-goes-beyond-supreme-court-courts-trial-last.html,The nations state courts increasingly frustrated with the restrictive rulings of the United States Supreme Court are emerging from its shadow and fashioning a distinctive body of civil liberties protections Focusing on their own longneglected constitutions and emboldened by the rhetoric of the new federalism state high courts are issuing rulings that go considerably beyond current interpretations by the United States Supreme Court This expansion of activity by state courts comes as the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts are being assailed by the Reagan Administration and conservatives in Congress If these attempts to curb the Federal courts succeed the state judiciary could gain even more influence and the rulings that are produced could surprise the conservatives who had hoped for decisions more in tune with their philosophy Among the rulings in which state courts have gone beyond the Supreme Court are some that establish tighter standards for wiretapping and for searches after an arrest including automobile searches a right to counsel at police station lineups and parole hearings and broader guarantees for a trial by jury The state courts have also extended free speech guarantees to private property such as shopping centers and privacy protections to bank records and certain sexual practices Today a new body of constitutional law is emerging based not on the Constitution of the United States but on the constitutions of the several states said Justice Stanley Mosk of the California Supreme Court long a proponent of state court activism Liberal state courts have taken the doctrines of federalism and states rights heretofore associated with people like George C Wallace and adapted them to give citizens more rights under their state constitutions rather than to oppress them Under the Supremacy Clause of Article 6 of the United States Constitution the most inconsequential Federal regulation overrides any conflicting state law even the state constitution But it has long been settled that the United States Supreme Court will not review any case decided on independent and adequate state grounds as long as the ruling does not infringe on Federal law As a practical matter this means that the United States Constitution sets a floor for civil liberties protections but not a ceiling States can broaden constitutional rights as they see fit as long as they base their decision even perfunctorily on their own constitutions The development of more active state judiciaries is by no means universal nor is it universally applauded Many state high courts particularly in the South and Southwest continue to take their cues from the United States Supreme Court Moreover tribunals such as the California Supreme Court that have frequently found protections in state constitutions that exceed Federal standards have come under sharp criticism from some state politicians In California for example conservatives are trying to curb the courts powers both through a constitutional amendment and a measure on this falls ballot Both measures would force the California high court to base its decisions regarding the exclusionary rule which bars prosecutors from using evidence illegally obtained by lawenforcement officials on the more conservative decisions of the United States Supreme Court rather than continue its own more liberal ruling in the area Even so the constituency favoring a more active and independent role for state high courts is a broad one It includes for example both ends of the United States Supreme Courts ideological specutrum from Justice William H Rehnquist who urges greater state autonomy as a matter of conservative conviction to Justice William J Brennan Jr who for several years has implored the state judiciary to carry the more liberal standard of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren Academics and Civil Libertarians It has also come to include prominent academics and civil libertarians people who for decades have dismissed state courts as reactionary judicial backwaters unworthy of study and unsolicitous of constitutional rights Recent rulings restricting access to Federal courts and the scope of civil liberties coupled with the changing attitudes in the state judiciary have touched off a new era in constitutional law said Norman Dorsen president of the American Civil Liberites Union These changes he added have created both a responsibility and an opportunity for state judges to scrutinize state constitutional provisions for the first time in decades or perhaps in generations Mr Dorsens remarks were made to a gathering of civil libertarians lawyers in private practice professors and state and Federal judges who assembled in Hartford at Connecticuts Old State House on April 17 for a program titled The Rediscovery of the Connecticut Constitution Boradening Protections for Individual Rights The meeting took place near the spot where the Rev Thomas Hooker declared in 1638 that the foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people sentiments that gave rise to the Fundamental Orders of 1639 said by some scholars to be the first written constitution anywhere The group heard Judge Jon O Newman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit offer his agenda for state courts in times of Federal court passivity More Akin to Alchemy Within the grand design of the old federalism there is room for a little chemistry to be practiced by state court judges construing the fundamental legal document of their state  the state constitution he said Perhaps the discipline is more likely that the leaden langauge of many state constitutional provisions is waiting to be turned into the pure gold of vital prtections of individual rights The prospect of resuscitated state constitutional case law has its proponents talking of the sort of Federalstate crosspollination long cherished by Louis D Brandeis who served on the Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939 A single courageous state he wrote in 1932 may serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country That hope all but vanished as Federal Courts became the prime protectors of individual rights and state constitutions lapsed into disuse While things have changed in the years that Warren E Burger has been Chief Justice numerous obstacles remain in the way of the Brandeisian ideal In many areas throughout the country state constitutions are still unused by judges untaught by law schools and unread by the very lawyers who have sworn to uphold them According to Millary Farmer a lawyer with Team Defense an Atlanta public interest law firm representing primarily criminal defendants the high courts of the Old Confederacy remain content to follow the lead of the Federal courts in the area of civil liberties and do so only out of fear The effect of courtstripping bills in the South he said would be complete disaster These courts are 10 years beyond slavery he said I dont see even an inkling of activism in them More activist state appellate courts have supplemented Supreme Court protections in many areas Search and seizure The high courts of California Alaska and Hawaii have tightened rules on searches after arrests while Rhode Island and South Dakota have curbed automobile searches Alaska Montana Michigan and Florida now require the authorities to obtain warrants before tapping conversations involving government agents SelfIncrimination Courts in California Hawaii and Pennsylvania have held that illegally obtained evidence otherwise barred from court cannot be used to impeach a defendant should he choose to testify Pennsylvania has construed what cosntitutes a waiver of a criminal suspects right to cousel more strictly than the United States Supreme Court while Utah and several other states have held that to compel criminal suspects to furnish evidence such as samples of their handwriting violates state constitutional protections against selfincrimination Right to counsel California Michigan and Alaska require counsel to be present at preindictment lineups of suspects New York Pennsylvania Utah and West Virginia have mandated the presence of lawyers at all parole and probation revocation hearings not just those involving sentencing Trial by jury Alaska has expanded the right to a jury trial beyond that for crime punishable by six months or more of imprisonment which is the United State Supreme Court standard North Carolina and Alabama have ruled that 12member juries are a fundamental right even in noncapital cases Free speech New Jersey Pennsylvania and Connecticut have ruled that the free speech protections of the First Amendment apply to activities carried out on private property such as shopping centers and universities as well as in public arenas The press and public have been granted greater access to trial proceedings in Ohio West Virginia Washington Oregon and Arizona The right of privacy California requires the authorities to obtain a warrant before being granted access to personal bank records The Alaska Supreme Court has upheld the use of marijunana but not cocaine in ones home State courts in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have invalidated state laws barring certain sexual practices while courts in California Connecticut and Massachusetts have ruled that the state must subsidize abortions and pregnancy expenses on equal terms The right to and education State courts in Arkansas Colorado Connecticut Maryland and New Jersey have followed Californias lead and found that a states distribution of educational benefits according to local property wealth is impermissible To the California Supreme Court according to Justice Mosk the paramount need is one of consistency In recent years he asserts the United States Supreme Court has careened from side to side forcing those state courts content to follow its directions to create and abandon doctrine as the tides ebb and flow on the Potomac In a similar vein several state judges say that the increasingly fractious nature of the United States Supreme Court whose members are often unwilling to join in majority opinions and choose to write their own instead makes the task of following its dictates difficult even for those inclined to try A lot of Supreme Court doctrines are no longer persuasive but filled with fuzzy soft terminology which has no cutting edge said Justice Hans A Linde of Oregons Supreme Court When the Courts doctrinal cogency and coherence begins to fall apart we have state courts saying in effect We dont have to do it that way  Others insist that the best justification for state court activism is pure federalist theory Proponents of this view assert that since state court judges have long interpreted the common law and for the most part must face the electorate periodically judicial activism on the state level is a more legitimate democratic instrument for change than its Federal counterpart Why should we always be the tail being wagged by the Federal dog asked Justice Charles G Douglas 3d of the New Hampshire Supreme Court As a federalist I feel its safer in the long run to have an independent state judiciary No matter what happens 200 years from now in Washington maybe some things can be prevented at the state level Some state judges however acknowledge that their divergence from the United States Supreme Court stems from explicit philosophical differences with its rulings rather than difficulties of interpretation William S Richardson Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court said Were still followers of the Warren and Brennan opinions because theyre heroes of ours In many instances the language contained in the state and Federal constitutions is roughly equivalent with the emerging differences purely a matter of interpretation On other occasions though results stem from state provisions with no Federal counterpart Available Bits of Language There are some amazingly available bits of language sprinkled throughout state constitutions said Prof Aviam Soifer of Boston University Law School Some 25 state charters for instance provide that all court proceedings be open a provision not explicitly contained in the Federal Constitution Numerous other state charters contain an explicit right of privacy Oregon is one of many states with a constitution that exceeds the Eighth Amendment prohibitions of cruel and unusual punishment providing that punishment be based on principles of reformation and not vindictive justice Three states protect the rights of the handicapped Louisiana prohibits euthanasia Hawaii bars nuclear power and many others provide for the right to bear arms in selfdefense as well in militias Sixteen states have passed amendments guaranteeing equal rights to women provisions that promise to become more important as efforts to enact a rights amendment to the Federal constitution stall Some 39 states protect freedom of speech in comprehensive terms that exceed limitations on governmental action contained in the First Amendment These provisions according to a forthcoming article in the Yale Law Journal could be used to protect nonunion employees in the private sector from dismissal for their political beliefs or activities a right heretofore unrecognized by the Federal courts But employees rights and sexual equality are only two of many areas in which to judges lawyers and law students alike a distinctive state constitutional jurisprudence remains more a matter of potential than reality The problem state constitutionalists argue begins with the elitism of legal education and educators In American law schools particularly the most prestigious and statusconscious the study of state law is considered parochial Of even more vital interest to professors anxious to make a name for themselves national reputations have generally been thought to come only by studying national law You can go through three years of law school and never hear of your state constitution said AE Dick Howard of the University of Virginia who was among the first prominent legal scholars to write about the state charters Law schools have a lot to answer for in permitting an overemphasis on the United States Supreme Court and the Federal Constitution Here too there are signs of change Prof Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School author of the most widely used treatise on American constitutional law plans a course in state constitutional law The Harvard Law Review devotes its most recent issue to recent activities of the state courts Moreover the first text on state constitutional law will soon be published As proponents of state constitutionalism seek to spread the faith they are debating the role of active state judiciaries in the Federal system The Harvard Law Reviews editors say that role is at most interstitial arguing The present function of state courts in a Federal system is as a second line of defense for those rights protected by the Federal Constitution and as an independent source of supplemental rights unrecognized by Federal law Others most notably Justice Linde of Oregon and Ronald KL Collins coauthor of the forthcoming state constitutional text and a judicial fellow at the United States Supreme Court disagree To treat a states constitution like a handy grab bag filled with a bevy of clauses that may be exploited in order to circumvent disfavored United States Supreme Court rulings Mr Collins has written will stultify the development of state constitutional law Many state bills of rights long predate their Federal counterpart With the emergence of an evermore active Federal judiciary however the state charters atrophied The situation began to change in the 1970s with the Burger Court A Reciprocal Relationship There is a reciprocal relationship between the US Supreme Court and the state courts Professor Tribe said As the Supreme Courts own energy flags or it reaches the limits of appropriate Federal judicial activity it may nonetheless have marked the path that creative state jurists will want to follow In the long view of history most of the truly creative developments in the American law have come from the states Not everyone however shares the present enthusiasm for the rediscovery of state constitutions Speaking at the Connecticut seminar Federal District Judge Jose A Cabranes reflected on American legal history and said The states failed in the task of protecting individual rights even as they had failed for generations to meet other articulated needs in an industrial democracy We may exalt the capacity of some state constitutions to provide broader protections than that provided by the Federal Constitution but we cannot ignore the fact that it is our national law interpreted by national courts which uniformly defines the individual rights of all our people Despite the growing role of the state judiciary the nations 50 chief justices voted unanimously in February to oppose proposed legislative steps by Congress to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction over such issues as abortion rights school desegregation and busing to achieve racial balance in schools Such measures the judges resolution said represented a hazardous experiment with the vulnerable fabric of the nations judicial system Justice Brennan of the United States Supreme Court once a New Jersey high court judge agrees Even the premise that state courts can be trusted to safeguard individual rights cannot justify either the Court or Congress in limiting the role of the federal judiciary Justice Brennan told an audience at New York University Law School on April 15 For to do so overlooks one of the strengths of our Federal system  that it provides a double source of protection for the rights of our citizens Federalism is not served when the federal half of that protection is crippled
NOW'S FUNDS SOAR SUGGESTING EXTENT OF WOMEN'S POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/20/garden/now-s-funds-soar-suggesting-extent-of-women-s-power.html,The National Organization for Women which is in the last six weeks of its longshot effort to get the proposed Federal equal rights amendment ratified has raised more money for its ratification campaign this year than the most successful  and conservative  political action committees The staff of NOW says it has received 13 million a month since last December through its direct mail phone banks and television appeals an amount that outstrips the 53 million that the political action committee PAC of the conservative Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina reported to the Federal Election Commission last year This outpouring of money principally from NOWs 200000 members is being spent on what most agree is an unlikely eventuality  the ratification in three states by June 30 of the proposed equal rights amendment Feminist leaders and members of the Democratic Party who enviously watch NOW spend so much money on what seems a desperate last hope are questioning what will happen to this newly discovered money machine once the June 30 deadline passes To be adopted the proposed amendment to the Constitution must be ratified by 38 state legislatures by then or it will die Three more are still needed There are also questions as to how NOW will regroup and whether it will join other feminist organizations in such economic and political actions as backing prochoice candidates in the fall if its quest for the equal rights amendment ends in defeat Eleanor Smeal the president of NOW harbors no doubts about the wisdom of the strategy that has converted the organization from one concerned with a broad spectrum of womens issues to one devoted primarily to the single issue of ratification So many people would like to think were talking about an impossible dream Mrs Smeal told a rally in Charlotte NC last week But I dont think a handful of people should so discourage us Why should we be fearful of literally a handful of men She claims that in the three states needed for ratification only two or three legislators stand between success and failure of the amendment Mrs Smeal accompanied by a small entourage of NOW staff which has organized itself after the fashion of a political campaign with advance people and a press secretary has been making speaking forays into North Carolina Illinois and Florida the three states on which NOW has pinned its hopes In each of the three states as well as in the opinion making centers of New York City Washington and Los Angeles there is a significant television advertising campaign showing such personalities as Alan Alda Marlo Thomas and Betty Ford In the three targeted states phone banks and a small army of volunteers many of them persuaded personally by Mrs Smeal to leave their jobs to work for ratification  back up the television commercials But even Mrs Smeal who at times exudes the ardor of a religious preacher concedes one key element is missing in each place In North Carolina the Democratic Governor James B Hunt who favors ratification has made a special effort in the last month backed by favorable new public opinion polls to lobby members of the Senate where twice before the amendment has failed by two votes In Florida Gov Robert Graham a Democrat has said that the amendment will be voted on again in the Legislature But despite public opinion polls that show the amendment is favored in Florida Mrs Smeal believes the major obstacle is the dean of the Senate Dempsey Barron In Illinois NOW is mounting a major television advertising drive urging the Republican Governor James R Thompson who is polling badly among women in his gubernatorial campaign to change the rules that require threefifths rather than a simple majority in both legislative chambers to pass a constitutional amendment NOW is confident that such a rule change will enable Illinois to pass the amendment The money received by NOW for the ratification effort has been relatively cheap to raise according to Roger Craver president of Craver Matthews Smith  Company the directmail house that works for NOW as well as the Democratic Party and various liberal interest groups Each monthly sum of 13 million since December has cost only 250000 to raise Mr Craver said He added that NOW had raised 700000 a month from August to December All of the money raised since the ratification countdown campaign began in August will be spent by June 30 The board of NOW has authorized me to spend all we get said Mrs Smeal While Mr Craver believes the fundraising capacity of NOW is impressive  by comparison the Democratic Party will raise only 25 million through direct mail during the entire year  Mrs Smeal is not entirely satisfied with the fund raising Its ridiculous to say its a lot of money when one gubernatorial race costs 5 million she said during an interview Weve not had as much support in constant dollars as the suffragette movement had Revealing some of the bitterness toward the Democratic Party that sometimes erupts in her conversation she added Weve been robbed of our legitimate support by defeatism in our natural base of our support A goodly portion of the time we have to keep saying theres a chance The Democratic Party doesnt understand They dont have the imagination to understand the change in the women and how political these issues have become Mr Craver says that the fund raising by NOW over the last year has illustrated that the potential political capacity of women is massive What the equal rights amendment demonstrates she said is the ability of NOW to raise immense amounts of money If they wanted to they could raise between July and October 4 to 5 million  the frustration of not passing ERA is so great and will be greater Mrs Smeal and other feminist leaders believe that the money coming into NOW for the ratification drive is motivated in part by the far higher negative rating women give President Reagan than men give him A New York TimesCBS News Poll in March showed that women disapproved of the way Mr Reagan was handling his job by 46 percent to 39 percent while men gave the President an approval rating of 48 percent to 38 percent With the backing of the proved fundraising capability the sharp criticisms of Mr Reagan by women could be easily harnessed to have a major impact on the November elections according to the feminist leaders Mrs Smeal who cannot run again for the presidency of NOW said that she has thought about the future beyond June 30 On Aug 26 the 62d anniversary of womens right to vote a PACWomans Day will be held to raise money to spend on support for candidates for the fall election she said adding Were determined to keep going and to improve the strength of the feminist forces inside the state and national levels We will be moving rapidly not allowing ourselves to be overcome If the amendment fails on June 30 a number of Representatives have said they will immediately reintroduce the amendment into the Congress But beyond that there are many feminists and office holders who are women who hope that NOWs organizational ratification effort carried on with such missionarylike zeal will be funneled into electing legislators at the state and Federal level in the fall Theyve created a grassroots support which will not stop after the deadline said Representative Geraldine A Ferraro Democrat of Queens I would be very surprised if NOW did not move to the forefront in electing officials who understand the issues Carol Burris a former president of the Womens Lobby and an early member of NOW said she believed that the proposed equal rights amendment was doomed before the extension for ratification was granted by Congress in 1978 Hence she is worried that the fervor that Mrs Smeal has been able to engender among her loyal followers has been wasted Its one thing to talk you into trying to elect Democrats in November  which seems likely Miss Burris said But I find it scary to talk someone into taking a year of your life for a dead issue Miss Burris said that after June 30 there should be a demonstration that the issue of womens rights is not dead I am hoping that Elly Smeal is going to leave in place a terrific organization she said Miss Burris also suggests that lawyers who are women should file discrimination suits in all the major jurisdictions around the country to show that there are still a lot of laws that discriminate against women The president of the National Abortion Rights Action League Nanette Falkenberg feels it is urgent for NOW to take a new tack after June 30 NOW is committed to their own strategy and they have pursued that strategy enthusiastically said Miss Falkenberg It has caused disagreement with other organizations and has caused animosities But they are able to go their own way

ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/23/books/l-abortion-156208.html,I read Robert Miners review on At the Center Feb 21 with a growing sense of horror Although he writes with complacent authority Mr Miner judging from his review probably never has been in a center offering abortions It may come as a surpirse to Mr Miller but it is not true that something at the center of us all  doctor patient bystander  finds the trage of abortion awesome althought the emotional consequences may at times be awesome for some participants It may also offend Mr Miners hypertrophied sense of outrage to learn that contemporary abortion clinics do not have assembly rooms Mr Miners blind agreement with the novelss author that an abortion is mutilation analogous to an animal gnawing off its leg makes the experience of reading this review more degrading and demoralizing than a lifetime spent in an abortion clinic This review is uniformed and therefore dangerously dishonest I am distressed at Mr Miners distorted judgement in thinking At the Center should be required reading for anyone who wants to confront the abortion issue today And it is regretful that Mr Miner thinks that he used this space to review a book when in fact he has simply seized an opportunity to indulge his personal point of view ADRIENNE FLECKMAN New York City
THE MAKING OF A DOCTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/23/magazine/the-making-of-a-doctor.html,David Blacks most recent books are The King of Fifth Avenue a biography of August Belmont and a novel Minds By David Black ne of the first patients Aaron Kenigsberg treated as a thirdyear student at New York University School of Medicine was a teenage girl who had run away from home She came to Bellevue Hospital in New York City where Aaron was doing his obstetricsgynecology clerkship complaining of pain in her pelvic area Most of the doctors assumed she was pretending to be in pain in order to get a free bed and meals She did not want to go home She was severely depressed When her mother was called she said it would be better if the girl committed suicide I didnt find her suicidal said Aaron With me  maybe because I was so close to her in age  she laughed and was in good humor The doctors used a laparoscope an instrument that allows doctors to view the contents of the abdomen  to examine the girls uterus and ovaries They found a benign tumor which they later removed surgically Because he had gained the girls trust Aaron was able to persuade her to cooperate with the doctors both before and after the operation It was very gratifying said Aaron Sometimes thirdyear students can feel as if theyre in the way causing trouble I felt for one of the first times I was helping But its a fine line When she got out she sent me her telephone number Sometimes when patients have no one to care for them and you do they want to keep getting that attention which of course you cant give How do you learn to care without making the patients misunderstand They dont tell you how to cope with that in the textbooks The third year of medical school is the passage from textbooks to the real world From a group interviewed at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and the New York University School of Medicine Aaron was chosen as an example of the typical medical student making this transition This journey has always been a difficult one  from the theoretical to the real But in the last 40 years since Aarons father Dr Samuel Kenigsberg graduated from NYU medical school the jump from books to bodies has become huge  because today doctors can do something that they could not do in Dr Kenigsbergs student days Today doctors can cure people Forty years ago to a great extent physicians were simply managers of disease They would make diagnoses and help support the patients as nature took its course They could make patients feel better but they were limited in how they could intervene Today medicine is in the midst of a revolution that is producing a new kind of physician  a doctor who has become an extension of their tools as much as his tools are extensions of himself Because of the radical changes in both technology and understanding they can intervene both surgically and medically in ways that would have seemed fantastic to students 40 years ago Procedures that were difficult and risky when Aarons father was in school  blood transfusion administering anesthesia  are now much safer Diseases like leukemia which were then exotic and fatal curiosities conditions to identify and regret can now be treated Pneumonia which in Dr Kenigsbergs student days was often fatal today can be cured almost routinely Forty years ago a doctor could carry all the medicines he might use in his black bag Today he would need a small truck There are approximately 25000 prescription drugs currently on the market The 1980s are also seeing advances in areas like genetic engineering and fetal surgery  fields that did not even exist when Aarons father was in medical school These transformations will change not only how physicians view and practice their professions but also how the public perceives and experiences doctors Physicians are no longer referees scoring the rounds between patients and disease They are now players You are no longer a spectator said Dr Saul J Farber dean of academic affairs and chairman of the department of medicine on the first day of school last fall The entire thirdyear class was assembled in the Schwartz Lecture Hall most of them like Aaron dressed in their white jackets with a reflex hammer threaded through a buttonhole a stethoscope hanging out of a pocket and a Penrose drain  a rubber tube which does double duty as a tourniquet  looped from their belts This is the most exciting year You now join the ranks of this dedicated and fine staff of professionals said Dr Farber referring to the doctors of the New York University Medical Center which includes Veterans Bellevue and University Hospitals NYU is one of the finest medicaltraining institutions in the country Students can work in both public and private hospitals treating such a great variety of medical problems that one of the catch phrases around the center is If it doesnt show up at Bellevue it doesnt exist The 176 students in the thirdyear class are among the best of the approximately 66000 students attending 126 medical schools across the country They were selected from 4853 undergraduates who applied to NYU medical school They have spent two years in classrooms and laboratories learning the basic sciences such as anatomy biochemistry genetics often impatiently Students in my era also didnt like the basic sciences Dr Farber said later But when they get into the clinical years they realize they should have paid more attention The thirdyear training is a course of five clinical clerkships three  obstetricsgynecology psychiatryneurology and pediatrics  which have from 20 to 30 students in each rotation and last about six weeks and two surgery and medicine  which have about 45 students in each rotation and last about 11 weeks But by the time they reach the third year they are being trained in the habits of being a doctor as much as they are in the specific procedures how to sort out from the confusion of details the relevant information about a patients case how to extract that information from occasionally unwilling patients how to do the paperwork how to manipulate the hospital bureaucracy in order to make sure things get done how to keep up with the endless medical literature and even unofficially how to deal with the stresses on the little personal life left to thirdyear students subinterns as fourthyear students on clinical rotations are sometimes called and residents doctors who are doing their postgraduate training These habits as much as textbook knowledge contribute to what Aaron considered a physicians special role in the community Whenever Aaron tried to define that special role he fell back on the same phrases that many of his classmates often used He talked about obligation the common good the desire to help the sick and the needy  phrases that are used among the general public less frequently today than they were a generation ago These young doctors sound singularly idealistic because events of the last 20 years have made highsounding statements suspect We now live in a cynical age when it seems more honest to admit to a base motive than to hold an altruistic one Candor has been confused with character In such a climate the generous  even selfsacrificing reasons Aaron and his classmates give for wanting to go into medicine can sound disingenuous especially since in many peoples minds doctors seem employed in a sinister alchemy that turns disease into money But it is impossible to fake the obsessive attention to detail that most medical students  and doctors  exhibit Such obsession comes only from a profound commitment Whatever its deeper psychological  even possibly selfish  motives such a commitment can leads to results that are selfless At worst this obsession may be impersonal In fighting disease medical students and doctors sometimes see patients as merely a battlefield  a point of view that has become easy to fall into because the advances in medical technology tend to distance doctors from patients In Dr Kenigsbergs medicalschool days a physician was still part of the patients extended family an avuncular presence who made house calls beaming with concern and good advice Today the increase in hardware has made doctors machine jockeys technicians as well as comforters The very changes that have enabled doctors to be so much more effective than they used to be are the ones that may make them seem remote and cold Like most of his classmates Aaron is faced with ethical questions that his father did not have to deal with Changes in both medicine and society have raised new issues or given renewed importance to old ones such as How does a doctor decide when to let a patient die Whom should he or she save Should rich patients receive better care than poor ones How much should a patient be told about his or her condition How should a doctor allocate limited resources To deal with these issues NYU has various classes in ethics  some during the thirdyear clerkships which like most medicalschool ethics classes are spottily attended Only about 50 percent of the class show up at these discussion groups Aaron admitted Ethics is a real hard issue I dont think physicians are always the best prepared Were not trained Were educated on the job which is unfortunate he added because the students are faced with ethical issues daily When Aaron was on his obstetricsgynecology clerkship for example he chose not to learn how to perform an abortion Women have the right he said But since Im not going to be an obstetrician I have no need to know how to do it no need to plague my conscience with the thought Its a legal not a medical problem A physicians role is not to make judgments but to function as a dispenser of care In the future these issues will be addressed more In bull sessions when the subject of ethics comes up which is infrequently the example the students invariably use is abortionAnd often the ethical question is not a womans right to an abortion but the issue of public funding and by extension the disparity in medical care between rich and poor Medical students are trained in hospitals where there is tremendous emphasis on keeping patients alive as long as possible said Patrick S Romano president of the American Medical Student Association As a result ethical questions dealing with decisions to extend life are often lost in lastminute heroics Its not a decision Id want to make right now said Aaron who expects that he will be more prepared when he has had a bit more experience Medicine is taught in an oldfashioned traditional way and hasnt caught up to the technology  Romano disagreed I think physicians may have a betterrounded education today than they did 40 years ago with a lot more emphasis on ethics community medicine and nutrition he said But their debt is so high when they graduate that theres more pressure on them to go into higherpaying specialties As a group Aaron and his classmates appear to be free of the greed that seems to motivate doctors in the popular imagination In fact given the high cost and length of a medical education most of Aarons medicalschool friends tend like Aaron to feel poor and disadvantaged During a dinner at a Chinese restaurant to celebrate the start of the school year about half of the dozen medical students present broke open their fortune cookies to find predictions of future wealth  which they all scoffed at When students discuss money they invariably complain about how poor they are how endless their medical training seems and how as residents they will be working 120 hours a week for relatively low wages The students view of their situation is not as surprising as it might seem Upon graduation medical students owe an average of 17588 for medical school and are still carrying an average debt if 3569 from college More than threequarters of the countrys medical students are in debt A firstyear resident at NYU Medical Center earns an average of 21500 per year whereas college classmates who have just graduated from business school could be earning 30000 and lawschool graduates at least in New York City can earn as much as 47000 to 50000 during their first year out But once they complete their training doctors catch up soon enough According to the most recent figures available the average doctor earns 79700 per year which varies from specialty to specialty and age group to age group The average 35yearold internist in 1979 for example was earning 60100 those between 36 and 40 were earining 86300 and internists between 41 and 50 earned 84000 These figures are somewhat anomalous the internists income usually peaks closer to the national average between 41 and 45 The average surgeon earns a little more At 35 he or she earned 77800 between 36 and 40 99700 between 41 and 45 112400 a little over 100000 between 46 and 60 Anesthesiologists tend to earn more than surgeons psychiatrists and pediatricians tend to earn less than physicians in other fields In New York all of these figures are a bit higher The reasons that doctors incomes peak comparatively early is that they have been in debt for so long and have started earning competitively so late that they feel pressured to catch up and are more aggressive in seeking patients Their income may decrease after 45 because then they are more likely to respond to demands from their families to spend more time at home General medical costs have increased even faster than doctors incomes When Dr Kenigsberg was in medical school in 1940 the aggregate national healthcare expenditure everything from office visits to building medical schools  was 4 billion Twenty years later it was 269 billion and in 1980 it had jumped to 2472 billion Personal health care increased as dramatically from 109 billion in 1950 1940 figures are unavailable to 237 billion in 1960 and 2179 billion in 1980 To give a sense of what it means to an individual in the last 10 years alone an office visit to a general practitioner has increased from 846 to 1821 and fees in New York are much higher If the professional rewards are more gratifying and the financial rewards greater than in the past the rites of passage are more intimidating than ever as is illustrated by the odyssey of Aaron Kenigsberg I Into the Real World During his junior year at Stanford University in Palo Alto Calif Aaron worked at the student health center as a ward assistant the following summer he was a research assistant to Dr Craig Heller an associate professor in Stanfords department of biological sciences He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology in January 1979 and after half a year spent traveling through Europe taking photographs  a common hobby for doctors  Aaron entered the New York University School of Medicine Aaron looks younger than his age which was 23 when he started his third year last fall and he is sensitive about what he once referred to as his baby face He is very proud of his three older siblings his sister Ruth 27 who was expected to graduate from law school last week his oldest brother Martin a 30yearold clinical psychologist and especially his other brother David a 29yearold doctor who went to the University of California San Francisco Medical School and is now doing a residency in family practice in the Amish country of Pennsylvania The tug of Davids idealism is powerful and the idea of family practice with its emphasis on preventive medicine  appeals to Aaron But specialization  knowing a field in depth  is also tempting to Aaron and in this he is encouraged by his father who is an internist and the physician in charge of the health center of the Union Family Medical Fund of the Hotel Industry of New York City Aaron of all the children is considered by the family to be most like his father And if Aaron went to undergraduate school in California because of his brother David he went to NYU because of his father Aaron was entering his third year with more experience than some of his classmates In addition to his college jobs he had spent a year at the Veterans Administration Hospital as a laboratory technician running blood tests and last summer he had done his obstetricsgynecology clerkship Still he approached the year a little nervously The first two years are nothing but reading he said You dont have the feeling its real yet The third year is not just reading about alcoholics but seeing an enlarged liver He felt as if he were emerging from Platos cave He would finally see what was casting those shadows on the wall which he had been studying for the last two years II A Natural Selection The five clinical clerkships give the students a taste of what it is like to practice each specialty and subspecialty and help them decide during their third year which field they will enter  possibly the most important decision they will make in their entire medical career To some extent this choice is a natural one influenced by personality technical ability and intellectual habits You can spot in the third year who is a surgeon said Dr Farber but not in the first year Surgeons tend to be the cowboys aggressive and freewheeling internists to be the detectives intellectual and pensive pediatricians to be gentle There are of course exceptions to the rule but the stereotypes turn out to be remarkably true Among Aarons friends much of the joking that first day of school was about who was a natural for which field In surgery youve got to learn to stick a needle anywhere in the body said Aaron after the orientation lecture in the Schwartz auditorium He had gone with half a dozen other students to the doctors local hangout the East Bay Restaurant across the street from the medical center I know a couple of guys whod be really good at that said another thirdyear student The conversation momentarily veered into predictable bawdy quips about which students would find their niche in gynecology which in proctology Medical humor like army humor tends to be coarse  and for the same reasons Jokes discharge anxiety and the subject matter of jokes comes from what the jokers are anxious about  in the case of doctors and soldiers the messy processes of life and death A popular professor started his first lecture of the year with a joke that appears in many different forms among medical students and physicians A student was alone in the emergency room when a woman came in with her son who had a coin stuck in his throat and was turning blue The student slapped him on a stretcher The stretcher slipped and headed down the ramp The boys head slammed into a wall The coin popped out The mother clasped the boy to her breast The student was terrified but he said coolly to the mother Sometimes we have to do that two or three times Among thirdyear students this joking is severe because so much is unknown and therefore threatening Thirdyear students are pnged into the real world of hospital procedure with few reference points A thirdyear student is like a 2yearold David Livingston said later Livingston was a firstyear resident they are no longer called interns  working at Bellevue Hospital I know Im only two years away from it But I think back then and excuse me but thirdyear students know nothing They walk into a ward and boggle In the confusion of the third year the need to choose a field keeps the student oriented Everything can be referred back to that question Since Aaron thought he wanted to become an internist he approached his surgical clerkship with an internists bias  focusing how to differentiate among problems like appendicitis gallbladder disorders ulcers etc  which struck his friends as appropriate In fact to nearly everyone Aaron seemed to be a natural internist someone whose personality and intellectual habits would suit him for that job But a natural bent for a field may not be enough Role models are a major influence according to Dr Farber so the luck of the draw  which senior staff members the students end up working with in each clerkship  can be a decisive factor As a result much of the talk among Aarons classmates was a kind of blackmarket trading of information about the senior staff If Aarons class turns out to be typical of NYU medical school about 50 percent will specialize in internal medicine which requires a minimum of three years of postgraduate work 15 percent in surgery which entails a minimum of five postgraduate years 15 percent in pediatrics which requires a minimum of three years and 10 percent in psychiatry which requires a minimum of four postgraduate years Ten percent of the class will go into various other fields The breakdown varies from school to school and region to region NYU is characteristic of the Northeast where more students are attracted to medicine Nationally only 34 percent of any class chooses medicine Curiously at NYU women who make up 26 percent of Aarons class the national average is 278 percent are tending to branch out from the traditional female specialties  medicine pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology  and more are going into surgery which is probably the most grueling field III A Tough Schedule Surgery requires hard work Dr Allan E Dumont the associate director of surgery at Bellevue had said at the orientation lecture Much is drudgery Im scared said one student as they finished up brunch at the East Bay Im nervous said another Im a little nervous admitted Aaron You always hear how things are going to be demanding People never talk as much about their development and growth during the third year as they do about the hardship The thirdyear schedule on surgery is arduous The day starts with hospital rounds at 630 in the morning On rounds the students follow the chief an experienced resident who was chosen for his superior performance from room to room through the ward and the intensivecare unit sometimes stopping in the emergency room or pediatrics checking on the progress of their patients The team includes a thirdyear resident a secondyear resident two firstyear residents and a subintern During the day in between tending to patients  which includes taking medical histories doing physical examinations and drawing blood samples  the students have lectures conferences rounds with senior staff members and tutorials Just before dinner there are evening rounds After dinner most students study reading up on assigned topics and on the cases they are helping to treat Saturdays there are only morning rounds The rest of that day and Sunday offer a chance to catch up on reading and sleep Every five days each student is on allnight call which means that he or she could be up for 36 hours straight This exhausting schedule predictably interferes with the students personal lives One night we were going out to dinner said Lisa Braun Aarons girlfriend who works in the publicity department at Doubleday  Company I was meeting him at his room Something happened at the hospital and he couldnt get word to me So I hung around the dorm for three hours from 5 to 8 Hospital administrators doctors and students all accept this extraordinary pressure and in fact seem a little proud of it When pressed they give only practical reasons for the schedule People come to the hospital  especially emergency  at night said Dr Farber and the important thing is that the students should have as much contact as possible with the patients because two years later theyre going to be responsible for patients Medical students and residents  who are on call even more frequently  often say they work such long hours because otherwise there would not be enough time to learn everything they need to know But a less acknowledged reason for the schedule is that it gets the students used to working under pressure so that later they will not be rattled in crises Functioning on the edge of exhaustion forces them to learn how to do many routine procedures automatically and how to make crucial decisions under the worst possible circumstances Although still rough the schedule is somewhat less demanding for the other three rotations Surgery and medicine are the killers said Aaron They say that after your surgery and medicine clerkships you become a doctor IV On Surgery The students who like Aaron were having their surgery clerkships in the fall were divided into six groups two for each hospital Although all three hospitals have partisans among the students in general the consensus seemed to be that the Veterans Administration VA Hospital opened in 1955 is the least attractive assignment for surgery The VA has a reputation for having the least interesting cases many suffering from already diagnosed chronic complaints It does have a system of pneumatic tubes which enables students to shoot blood samples directly to the laboratory a valuable asset since without it thirdyear students can spend as much as a third of their time running samples to the lab University Hospital opened in 1963 is generally believed to be the most attractive assignment It too has pneumatic tubes In addition computer terminals were installed in most of the nurses stations last summer to keep track of patients charts The patients at University Hospital tend to be middle or uppermiddle class which means it is easier to take their medical histories something thirdyear students spend a lot of time doing At the other two hospitals language and mental problems often make taking histories difficult The surroundings at University are more pleasant And the hospital tends to be generally well equipped with supplies which is not necessarily true at Bellevue Hospital  at least according to some of Bellevues house staff Bellevue the oldest of the three and the flagship of New York Citys municipalhospital system was founded in 1736 When a thirdyear student from another medical school who was considering spending some time at Bellevue phoned David Livingston the firstyear surgical resident Livingston said after hanging up Im sure hell love it  as long as he doesnt want to be in a hospital that has towels Livingston is tall bearded and abrasive but his abrasiveness is not unkind It is an emotional sandpaper smoothing the way for the thirdyear students like Aaron who were assigned to 15East one of the two services on the 15th floor in the new Bellevue which opened in 1975 Aaron felt he was lucky in his assignment because at public hospitals like Bellevue students generally have more responsibility for patient care than at private hospitals In addition everyone on his team was as dedicated and helpful as Livingston which is not always the case Some doctors scant teaching  especially surgeons who are under a great deal of pressure All of the members of the 15East team were accessible to the thirdyear students and encouraged questions The chief resident Steven L Snively was a tall blond doctor who looked like a young Jimmy Stewart and had the ironic manner of James Coburn He could sound sharp at times but the sharpness betrayed affection and intimacy  and it made him seem like one of the guys which gave 15East a relaxed atmosphere other services did not necessarily have He could be equally sharp with the patients Dont grab me he snapped to Adele Stevenson a young woman who had been found on the street in a puddle of blood and had been given a colostomy the surgical creation of an artificial anus All patients names have been changed to protect their privacy ner The rest of the interview was friendly and adult Rather than condescend and encourage patients to feel helpless and childlike Snively treated them the way he treated his staff  as peers His directness was tonic It is the medical equivalent of a Zen master answering his students question with a slap It shocks the patient back to reality Aaron learned quickly from Snively Not long after Aaron and two other thirdyear students attached to 15East were doing a physical examination on an alcoholic named Ray OMalley who was suffering from cirrhosis a potentially fatal liver disorder and esophageal varices enlarged veins in the esophagus that had ruptured and were bleeding One after another the students palpated examined by touch his liver listened with their stethoscopes and percussed examined by tapping practicing on the patient so in the future they would recognize the condition It is a normal procedure at a teaching hospital Two of them percussed with four fingers the third tried it with one As OMalley watched with growing alarm they discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods of percussing and palpating The patient by now staring wideeyed down his supine body apparently misunderstood the students intensity He seemed to think they were appalled by his condition Noticing OMalleys growing anxiety Aaron said Now weve found your liver The joke an admission of their own inexperience was an attempt to treat the patient as a peer V The Professional Personality Aarons surprising candor was part of the professional personality he was developing Around the time of the OMalley incident he gave a physical examination during which he had to poke a swab into a patients urethra to take a gonococcus culture As he did it he tucked his chin and stared fixedly over the top of his glasses the way he might have done while watching a horror movie On another occasion Snively and his team looked in on a young girl with esophageal varices the same condition that OMalley was suffering from With a 71yearold varices are selfinflicted Snively said adding that they are usually the result of too much alcohol With a girl its chance Shes a victim It makes you wonder if Someone upstairs is watching what He has in mind for this child Aaron stood at the foot of the bed chin tucked staring over his glasses When the rest of the team moved on to check another patient Aaron lagged behind Still gazing at the girl he said She has a clean slate a whole life ahead Youd like it to start off as pleasant as possible The chin tuck and overtheglasses stare which had started as a defensive mannerism a way of shielding himself and at the same time forcing himself to look matured during Aarons surgery clerkship until it became automatic part of his professional manner He tucked and peered when he went with Sara Caldararo one of the two women in their group of nine thirdyear students to watch another student Jeffrey Danzig change the dressing on Adele Stevensons wound Jeffrey peeled away the old gauze pads revealing a deep incision in her abdomen The lower part of the cut was still wide open and looked as though it were stuffed with red silks Sara teeth clenched together hissed in sympathy as she gazed at the raw wound The retention stitches looked like giant staples bridging the cut As Jeffrey gently tugged some gauze under the stitches Aaron added one more mannerism to his repertory He pursed his lips Well he said trying to joke away the tension what can you tell me about wound healing When Jeffrey turned the patient on her side so he could treat the decubitus ulcer on her buttocks a bedsore that looked as if she had been flayed Aarons professional manner broke He closed his eyes for a second and holding on to the rail on the side of the bed crossed his legs tightly at the ankle He took a breath uncrossed his legs tucked his chin again peered over his glasses pursed his lips and in a professional voice said It looks clean though Probing the wound with a longhandled swab Jeffrey said Youve got to get it as far in as the wound goes and twirl it around As he worked he squinted slightly  his own way of coping Each of the thirdyear students very quickly developed ways of dealing with the pain they saw Some turned a bit sideways Others threw back their heads Still others cleared their throats Within a week whenever Aaron had to deal with anything serious even when he was not confronted with pain he adopted his professional manner  as he did with Gregory Geiger a man suffering from a ventral abdominal hernia How did you sleep Aaron asked Geiger before morning rounds OK said the patient His legs were blotched like tree stumps covered with lichen On the right side of his abdomen was a huge lump it looked as if he had swallowed a toaster oven When he coughed the lump moved halfway across his stomach But the condition was not severe The doctors had decided to discharge him Did you talk to the social worker Aaron asked That nurse is crazy Geiger said I aint going to the Bowery She talks about going to the shelter Like Im going Like I have a place to stay So youre going to go to the street then or what asked Aaron Well if the relief give me a place to go to Geiger said I dont know Ill talk to the social worker Aaron tucked his chin even lower furrowed his brow as he peered over his glasses and pursed his lips more tightly In 30 years from across a desk in his office that look would be formidable VI Getting Used to Not Getting Used to It As Livingston had predicted the first weeks were confusing The thirdyear students hung around their services afraid of missing something In moments of transition between rounds and lectures flocks of students could be found hovering at the elevators trying to come to some consensus about what to do Since most of them wanted to prove their dedication no one wanted to suggest taking a break for a luxury like lunch Missing meals showed fortitude Basically I didnt know what was going on Aaron said later about the start of the clerkship Nurses would come to the rescue sometimes explaining what certain notations on the patients charts meant The subinterns fourthyear medical students and residents shared secrets of the trade One subintern Clifford Schob gathered the thirdyear students together in the doctors station on 15East to explain the use of small looseleaf notebooks given out by a drug company to every member of the class Those blue books have good information printed in front Schob said And the pages in back he explained could be used for crib sheets places to write down notes to jog the memory As a resident Schob said some day or night youll be on the emergency ward and someone will come in with renal kidney failure and you look up in your blue book to see what you jotted down for renal failure As reverently as if he were passing out pages from a Gutenberg Bible Schob handed around sheets from his own blue book so the thirdyear students could copy particular key facts The thirdyear students were reminded not to discuss patients in the elevator so the public wouldnt overhear In fact the public mostly visitors to the hospital  was discussed as if it were a servant class When the public was around meaningful conversation among doctors stopped to be continued only after the public left One of the firstyear residents showed Aaron how to draw blood fom the groin which he called doing a fem stick which means he inserted a needle into the femoral artery or vein Its the worst site in the world to get blood from said the resident The thirdyear students helped each other too offering up bits of hospital lore they had learned James Cunningham told Deborah Driscoll the other woman assigned to the 15East team how long it took to get a report on a blood culture Deborah told another student what ASAP meant  as soon as possible Aaron on learning that he missed seeing a GI gastrointestinal  workup complained I havent seen a barium enema yet Sara Caldararo reassured him that it was like a regular enema The students also passed around less official bits of information For example there is a popular medical aphorism Watch one do one teach one At Bellevue the students learned a blackhumor variation Watch one do one kill one VII On Call On Friday Sept 18 Aaron was slated to have his first night on call He arrived at Bellevue for rounds at about 645 in the morning in a grumpy mood The day before because of a lecture he had missed an operation on his first patient Juan Figueroa A subintern had told him he was lucky not to have seen it  it was gruesome But Aaron had not gone to medical school for esthetics and he regretted missing the chance to pit himself against so awful an operation When he entered the doctors station he muttered his hellos and then antisocially hunched over his copy of Manual of Medical Therapeutics a spiralbound pocketsized book sometimes called the instant intern which like the blue book Schob touted served as a source of quick information Most of the thirdyear students had got over their confusion There was no longer the undercurrent of urgent questions As they waited for Snively the firstyear resident they lounged around discussing patients the terrible food in the 12thfloor commissary how little time there was to read newspapers football the transvestite whose breast implants had become infected  The doctors station was a small room  about 15 feet by 15 feet  next to the larger nurses station A builtin desk which ran around two walls was littered with back issues of Hospital Practice and The New Physician empty paper coffee cups a copy of The Scarsdale Diet clipboards a crumpled white coat a blue sweater and outdated nurses notes On one wall was a light box The Xrays on it made it look like a blackandwhite stainedglass window Another wall was used as a bulletin board Announcements the oncall schedule for the thirdyear students and a takeout menu for a Chinese restaurant were all tacked up with hypodermic needles Rounds were routine Figueroa Aarons patient Stevenson OMalley and some patients who had been admitted the night before  a heroin addict with abscesses on the elbow and neck a pancreatitis case and a gallbladder case There was also a man who had swallowed his false teeth which had then bitten through his intestine The usual budget of disaster After rounds the thirdyear students regrouped in the doctors station where they horsed around One of the signs of tertiary syphilis is a broadbased gait and foot slap said James Cunningham He demonstrated waddling out the door into the corridor Ive never seen it said Jay Wortzel a secondyear resident who talked with a twitching upper lip like Humphrey Bogart Except in James said Aaron sounding antagonistic rather than funny He was grumpier now than he had been when he arrived for rounds because he had just learned that his patient Figueroa was going home Another success for Kenigsberg he said Although he was happy the patient was doing so well he was annoyed that he now had no patients to follow At the 15thfloor elevators Aaron told Sara Caldararo I may never get into surgery Come with me to watch she said She was on her way to see a colostomy closure closing up the patients artificial anus As they headed for the operating room Aaron continued to mope I want some patients he said You can have one of mine she said The patient she offered was named David Ling The previous year he had had most of his large intestine removed because of cancer of the colon and he had recently been readmitted to the hospital because of a smallbowel obstruction Ill take him said Aaron About 530 that evening Aaron and Schob went down to the emergency room to check on a patient named Ernesto Mercado who had been admitted earlier with bleeding ulcers in his small intestine and required surgery Aarons eyes glittered with excitement This finally was what he had been waiting for an interesting operation and a patient he could follow from the beginning right through Mercado had a history of bleeding ulcers He had been given cimetidine a drug that inhibits gastricacid secretion to allow the stomach a chance to heal but he was not responding to this treatment so he was slated for a Billroth II an operation to remove a portion of the stomach thereby decreasing the production of hydrochloric acid and to hook up the remaining portion of the stomach to the small intestine As a cure for ulcers it is extremely effective Schob told Aaron Work him up Get a history And save his life Aaron grinned and adjusted his tie knot While waiting to talk to Mercado Aaron tapped his copy of Manual of Medical Therapeutics against the door frame A couple of times he checked to make sure that Mercado would remain his patient In the elevator after leaving the emergency room Aaron said If it were like this every day it would be a lot more interesting After he had finished with Mercado he went into the doctors station and stood uncertain about what to do nextWhat did Sara say he asked himself You only get tired when you sit down During the evening he learned two other rules for being on call Eat when you can sleep when you can The worst parts of the night were the peaceful moments when there was no crisis and the only sounds on the floor were the whisper from the airconditioning the rattle of a passing cart and the occasional bell announcing the arrival of an elevator around the corner from 15East The relative quiet gave the hospital the feel of a space station a selfcontained and claustrophobic environment The boredom was deadening No wonder the doctors and students preferred the excitement of an emergency In the middle of the night Aaron was making his fourth circuit of the hospital emergency room recovery room intensivecare unit 15East  looking for action when he heard about a man in his early 20s who had been brought in with multiple stab wounds in his chest The man was described as being dead on arrival His heart which had been pierced had stopped He was transferred immediately to the operating room where his heart was shocked and massaged to get it going again Two residents worked on him nearly all night Aaron and another thirdyear student kept running down to get more blood and then helping to give it They would take a pint put it on an IV line and squeeze the bag of blood with their hands to get it into the patient as fast as possible By 530 in the morning the patient was stable It really shows what a surgeon can do Aaron said The person came in dead A surgeon could rob death During the following 10 days Aarons confidence grew As a thirdyear student he could not prescribe medication or make any final decisions about treatment but he became outspoken in his opinions about what should be done for those patients he was following When he suspected Ling of having pneumothorax a collapsed lung for example he argued with one of the residents who disagreed until the resident gave in Ling was Xrayed He did have pneumothorax which could have been caused by an injury to the lung Having the Xray turned out to be a good idea Aarons ventral hernia had gone home His duodenal ulcer the Billroth II was postop and doing fairly well On Tuesday Sept 22 when he was on call again he got a pancreatitis The next day in the firstfloor clinic he had a hernia a venereal wart and abdominal pain Over the next several months throughout his surgery and medicine clerkships Aaron would struggle with the patients nonhospital identities getting last names wrong and forgetting first names Like other students and residents he referred to the patients as though they were externalizations of his own sufferings my pancreatitis my hernia my ulcer On Friday of that week his pancreatitis Jesus Castro was feeling sick Aaron stayed late to make sure that whoever was taking over his caseload knew everything he knew about Castro  as well as his other patients For the next three weeks Aaron would be off 15East doing his three surgical electives the subspecialties cardiovascular disorders of the heart and major blood vessels trauma injuries and oncology tumors All in all Aaron felt satisfied with the way his surgical clerkship was going The night before he and Schob the fourthyear student had gone to a local Chinese restaurant Aarons discovery Before Aaron left 15East Schob gave his professional judgment of Aaron You can tell Aarons a good medical student he said He knows all the best cheapest Chinese restaurants VIII The Subspecialties The thirdyear students were exposed to the three surgical subspecialties for a week each just long enough to inoculate them against total ignorance in the fields These electives began with as much confusion as the surgery clerkship itself had Patients were already on the wards in various stages Learning about them getting into the routine was like jumping on a moving merrygoround But unlike the beginning of the surgery clerkship when it took Aaron at least a week to get into the swing on the electives he fit himself in by the end of the first day Aaron and Jose Cintron another thirdyear student were assigned to the same cardiovascular  CV  team at University Hospital On the first day as they waited for their CV team to gather they assured each other about how similar CV rounds would be to their regular surgery rounds The principal difference which they would not appreciate until halfway through the week was that given the short time they were on that service they would not really be able to follow the progress of the patients They observed more than they helped Another difference was a result of the change not in service but in hospitals At University Hospital the rooms were mainly semiprivate or private filled with flowers and articulate patients  patients who often questioned the doctors more than the doctors questioned them When a fifthyear resident on CV told a patient that they were not going to put in a tap to drain fluid from her lungs she said Youre not as bad as I thought Then she grilled him about why they had come to that decision A third difference between regular surgery service and CV was the hours They had to be at the hospital at least halfanhour to an hour earlier Are you sure you want to be a surgeon and wake up so early Aaron once asked Anthony M Frasca a subintern attached to CV On Monday for thrills and stuff Aaron touched a live heart On Tuesday night he assisted at a sixhour operation to repair a nickelsized hole between the left and right ventricles of a patients heart In a normal heart blood passes from the left ventricle through the aorta and then throughout the body In this patient most of the blood passing through the left ventricle backed up through the hole into the right ventricle Of every 25 liters the left ventricle was pumping only five liters were going into the aorta During the operation as they were sewing up the hole Aaron held the heart out of the way He came away from the operation awestruck He couldnt seem to get over the fact that such techniques had been impossible when his father was in school On Wednesday morning Aaron could not stop yawning After rounds he Frasca and Omar Fleischaker like Aaron a thirdyear student on his CV elective were rushing down to the firstfloor cafeteria to grab a sitdown breakfast which lasted a leisurely 10 minutes What would you say is the main difference between medicine and surgery Omar asked Frasca put his thumbs behind the lapels of his white jacket and said with mock solemnity Surgeons are doctors The joke reflected the genial antagonism between medicine and surgery The internists believe they do the real work identifying the problem and that surgery is merely a matter for technicians The surgeons believe they do the real work the actual repairing of the body and that medicine is merely a screening service that saves surgeons time And among the surgeons those on CV see themselves as an elite corps the surgical Green Berets ready to invade the bodys very heart to save the patient After breakfast the three students went to look at a coronary angiogram an Xray film of dyed blood passing through the arteries that supply the heart The film black and white and silent had the look of an oldfashioned home movie The heart pumped with a kind of shrugging motion When the dye was injected it suddenly shot into the blood vessels around the heart  as white and sudden as lightning After viewing the angiogram Aaron Omar and Frasca rushed back to the 15th floor for rounds with Dr Frank C Spencer the chairman of the department of surgery Dr Spencer was an Olympian figure to students and residents He is one of the best heart surgeons in the country and his eminence filled them with fear His rounds were legendary The three students found the others on their CV team sprucing themselves up The residents had changed out of their scrubs the baggy pajamalike clothes worn in the operating room and were dressed in shirts and ties or in the case of Lori Greenwald a firstyear resident in fresh blouse and skirt She was leaning against the wall nodding off and shaking herself awake It had been a rough night on call Dr Spencer was a halfhour late Every time someone appeared at the end of the hall all eyes flicked sideways to see who it was  if he was coming Tension built Aaron was like Ishmael waiting for Ahab to come on deck Frasca reminded Aaron On Spencers rounds you dont ask questions You speak when youre spoken to When Dr Spencer finally arrived he turned out to be an amiable softspoken man with a great economy of gesture He was not at all distant with the students but he was a gentleman in the old sense of the word and so expected a certain civility of discourse which students and residents apparently mistook for remoteness Not only was he not aloof he was compassionate One of his heart patients had had silicone implants years before When they walked into her room he helped button her nightgown After his team had followed him out of the room he explained If shes had an implant shes vain  proud of her appearance He didnt want her to feel uncomfortable by having the purple scar on her chest from the heart operation exposed unnecessarily He saw his patients whole rather than as collections of symptoms and tried to help them see their illnesses in perspective not as the one thing that should dominate their lives Perhaps most significantly he translated the jargon of his profession into simple English One patient as a result of an infection had developed a sheath of scar tissue around the heart Dr Spencer explained that the sheath had to be peeled away as one would peel an orange so the heart could expand and contract freely The most striking thing Dr Spencer did during rounds was kneel next to the bed of one patient who was in very bad shape so that he could talk to him with their heads on the same level The man would not have to stare up as though gazing into the heavens This may have been the single most generous act Aaron had seen  and would see  during his clerkships and one that went unremarked Aarons trauma elective fell between Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur so of the three electives it engaged him least He had been on call on his regular surgery service Bellevues 15East on Sunday As a result he had again become involved with Castro his pancreatitis and Ling his smallbowel obstruction the people Aaron felt were his real patients Also trauma in itself interested him less than the other subspecialties Knife and gunshot wounds mostly Obvious problems which did not require great subtlety of diagnosis In addition Aaron did not get along with the nursing staff Since he happened to be on trauma at Bellevue it was easy for him during slow periods to sneak up to 15East to spend time with the patients he really found interesting On Tuesday Oct 6 at about 2 in the afternoon Aaron and Omar who was also assigned to trauma were hanging around the doctors station You missed some fun said Omar A detective was here to interview a patient who was stabbed on the Bowery  a Cuban boat person Omar had been the Cubans translator He was so tired that he nearly fell asleep while telling Aaron the story Aaron offered to take the patient whose name was Jose Gomez for his chest Xray When he asked a nurse for a wheelchair she said Youve got that assignment If you want a wheelchair youve got to go from room to room Weve got a wheelchair shortage Aaron found an antiquated wooden wheelchair with the varnish rubbed off the arms As he was pushing it back to Gomez the same nurse stopped him and pointed out that unlike modern metal wheelchairs it had no place to hang an IV bottle What do you suggest Aaron asked She did not respond Aaron recruited a visiting student from Australia Guy Windsor Dont they have porters here Windsor asked Aaron said yes adding But anything you want done youve got to do yourself As Aaron pushed Gomez in the wheelchair Windsor pushed the wheeled IV pole The wheelchair was hard to steer and kept bumping into the IV pole or against the wall At every bump Gomez grabbed his belly His wound started bleeding Blood soaked through the dressing and gown Aaron checked the wound It looked OK But the whole incident upset him He felt the nurse had not respected him as a future doctor He was not at all disappointed that halfway through the week he could leave trauma to go home to Little Neck in Queens for Yom Kippur IX You Can Go Home Again During the day Aarons father said recalling his own third year at medical school youd go to so many lectures and then it was lunchtime Youd get an hour or two off Wed all congregate at a central place   You took two hours off for lunch Aaron asked We played cards Aarons father said We killed an hour or so We played pool Fortytwo years down the road Aaron said Ill say that I took two hours off for lunch Dr Kenigsberg a baldish 66yearold man who tended to gesture at Aaron with two fingers in what looked like a papal blessing was talking to his son about the similarities and differences between their third years at NYU Tuition of course has increased From 600 to 9300 a year According to NYU supplies including books have gone up from 75 to 550 housing from 200 to an average of about 1500 per year about half of NYUs medical students live in the dormitory and board from 300 to 1900 Next year tuition will increase to 10925 and other expenses will probably rise commensurately In Dr Kenigsbergs day there were only eight women in a class of 131 6 percent Although he did not sound sure Aarons father admitted that now maybe its better You get a feminine point of view Most of the differences however were professional Medicine is harder because of the progress in the fields said Aaron referring to the explosion of information  although he acknowledged that everything is relative Certain diseases which were dreadful in our day said Dr Kenigsberg now are not a big deal Aaron remembered looking through his fathers yearbook and learning that the medical school used to have a department of syphilology and dermatology Yes his father said remembering the days before penicillin Syphilis was a big thing Pneumonia was another disease that loomed larger in Dr Kenigsbergs third year at medical school than in Aarons When we were clerking Aarons father said the terrible thing was to get a pneumonia case Whoever was on had to go and type the sputum and there are 32 different types of pneumococcus Now he added you put them on penicillin Big deal He grinned like Ernest Borgnine Penicillin was the first of the antibiotics that in 1941 the year Dr Kenigsberg graduated from medical school revolutionized medicine Aaron with his surgical clerkship on his mind talked about how antibiotics not only were effective against disease but also were useful in surgery In his fathers day Aaron explained infection was a major complication Surgery might be right but postsurgical infection could kill you The antibiotics used against infection freed surgery to make its major advances It was an unknown thing operating on the heart in those days Dr Kenigsberg said Technology has opened up almost every field of surgery Aaron started to run down a list but his father had already galloped ahead to talk about other advances that had occurred since his third year in medical school Soon they were reciting antiphonally Microbiology Steroids Geriatrics Immunization in pediatrics In obstetrics more babies surviving New drugs In Dr Kenigsbergs medicalschool days most learning could be done by rote Aarons father and his contemporaries mastered procedures that they expected to last a lifetime of practice Now medical students expect significant changes in almost every field every five years or so Whatever they learn they will have to amend Therefore they tend to be less concerned with particular facts than Dr Kenigsbergs generation was and they tend to be more concerned with processes how procedures were developed the thinking behind the techniques Medicine is a city that rebuilds itself every few years and the doctors who fail to keep up on an almost daily basis will very quickly wake up and find themselves Rip van Winkles After listing a few more advances  organ transplants the possibility of gene transplants  they reached the changes in patients and they were no longer in harmony Both agreed that patients tended to be more demanding But they disagreed on whether this was good or bad Patients are very aware Dr Kenigsberg said Theres so much in the news They want this and that test They come in with clippings Aaron recalled a professor who told him a patient will come in and say I want a radical mastectomy with en bloc lymphnode dissection referring to the removal of the breast and lymph nodes Aaron thought this proved patients were more sophisticated than they had been in his fathers day But Dr Kenigsberg said that for that time they had been just as sophisticated Aaron thought that the more patients knew  about prevention about nutrition about lifeenhancing behavior  the better If people take control of their own health he said theyll be much easier to take care of His father shrugged He thought they wanted too many tests which boosted the cost of medical care Aaron thought the increase in the number of tests was just as much the result of doctors who were afraid of being sued for malpractice Doctors order the tests to weed out the one case in a thousand that might slip by undiagnosed Dr Kenigsberg shook his head unhappily It isnt the doctors the system of medicalcare delivery is at fault And he talked about how some of the new advances cause as many problems as they cure Weve created diseases he said All these antibacterials anticancer drugs create other infections Whats happened is I see more problems from people who have been taking medication side effects But in the end they agreed more than they disagreed The treatment of the day changes Aaron said but the disease stays the same X Combining Surgery and the Humanities Daniel F Roses an associate professor of surgery and a director of the oncology service to which Aaron was assigned had confirmed his popularity with the students in the first five minutes of the first tumor lecture he had given that fall As usual in the onceaweek lecture he had started with a story  like the one about the professor who asked a student Whats the true function of the spleen Of course said Dr Roses no one really knows the true function of the spleen But the student thinking he is supposed to know it says I forgot The professor says What a shame The one person in the world who knows and he forgot  Stories like these were meant to let the students know that to be serious did not mean to be solemn His joke revealed that he understood the only way to bear tragedy is to see it as comedy Life is no more than a burlesque show Love is the pretty lady shedding her clothes and Death is the comic whose pants hang around him as baggy as aged flesh Dr Roses lectures were models of lucidity and extraordinary examples of knowledge in the service of humaneness  not knowledge for its own sake He has not forgotten as some have why doctors treat disease He was as the students said a patientoriented doctor In his lectures he constantly tried to bring the students down to earth  to the reality that many forgot in the maze of facts He reminded them that knowing the proper Latinate term for a condition is not the same as understanding it During his lecture on breast cancer he became impatient with the alternation of smug and obfuscating jargon and mumbled ums likes and you knows As youre talking to your colleagues theyll want you to be articulate he said So develop a vocabulary Be simple Use your eyes and common sense He turned to a mammogram an Xray of a breast In the middle was a formation that looked like a lunar crater with a meteorites impact lines radiating out from it Dr Roses question about what the students noticed was met with silence Well is it regular or irregular Again silence Irregular OK here we have a mass thats radioopaque visible in an Xray and irregular Dr Roses was teaching the students to see the obvious Its just a matter of looking he said You dont have to know anything Just use your eyes Thats whats known as being thorough You know why Sherlock Holmes had a magnifying glass To see things Who was Sherlock Holmes Joseph Bell What kind of physician was he A surgeon The blank stares that met this recital betrayed how little beyond medicine many of the students knew Dr Roses knew literature and music knew that Theodore Billroth the surgeon whose name identified one of the operations Aaron had been involved in originally wanted to be a musician and was an intimate of Johannes Brahms He connected medicine with the civilization out of which it developed And he wanted the students to do the same XI Finishing Up Surgery By the time Aaron got back to his regular surgery service on Bellevue 15East on Monday Oct 26 the resident surgery staff had changed twice The new chief was Ronald Gross a short thin intense man with a reputation for being a superior surgeon In the emergency room he showed Aaron a 74yearold patient who had just arrived complaining of nausea and 14 days of constipation possibly because of an obstruction in the bowel Aaron repeated a catch phrase he had heard Never let the sun set on a bowel obstruction The patient Solomon Cohen was cadaverous His ankles were so thin that Aaron could have easily circled one with his thumb and forefinger Looks like a survivor of a concentration camp Gross said out of the patients earshot Cohens legs were dark red and covered with white scales His toes were the purple of kidney beans Poor circulation Gross suspected him of having a perforated colon probably the result of cancer eating away at his bowels He decided to do an abdominal paracentesis tapping the abdomen to drain off some fluid  which can be used in making a diagnosis If theres anything abnormal in there Gross told Cohen well do an operation Is it painful Cohen asked about the paracentesis His voice was hoarse and wheezy He sounded as if he were talking from a great distance over a bad telephone connection Only the Novocain Gross said Aaron went to get Cohens chart from the emergencyroom nurses station When he got back to the bed David Kapelanski a thirdyear resident and Gaetano Paone a secondyear resident on 15East were talking to Gross Gross had to leave suddenly because of a personal emergency Kapelanski and Paone would do the paracentesis assisted by Aaron As Gross gave the residents lastminute instructions about Cohen and his other patients Aaron took Cohens history asking questions about his past health as well as his present condition Between answers Cohen made little sounds of pain They pulled down the sheets Cohens chest was caved in but his belly which they painted with Betadine a reddish antiseptic was swollen and soft and webbed with pale blue veins Kapelanski told a nurse We could use some more towels Theyre really hard to come by she said Kapelanski arranged the towels he had so that only a triangle of Cohens abdomen was visible He stuck a needle sideways into Cohens belly A bubble of Novocain appeared under the skin When he drew the scalpel down Cohens abdomen a red line appeared It looked as if he were writing with a Magic Marker The results of the paracentesis indicated the need for surgery Tuesday night during the operation to find the obstruction Cohen died Aaron was shaken Its really hard he said The hardest thing so far Its hard to see people dying For the next week Aaron seemed disturbed by Cohens death He admitted that he had been sleeping badly Frequently he brought Cohen up in conversation He did not seem to recover his spirits fully until Friday Nov 6 Halloween decorations were still up  like the paper skeleton with the IV tube and surgical dressing taped to its bare rib cage on the door of the 15East nurses station Aaron spent most of the day in the operating room with Gross The first patient had a ventral abdominal hernia He was cut open from his chest to just above his crotch The exposed tissue was as slick as strawberry JellO Gross was using the electrocautery a tool that looks like a soldering iron and cuts tissues and cauterizes  or burns  blood vessels at the same time There was a very slight whiff of burning in the air Gross stopped cutting Paone who was also assisting irrigated the wound washing it out even sticking his gloved hand in the hole and wiping it around On the radio Olivia NewtonJohn was singing Hopelessly Devoted to You Gross picked up a lip of loose skin with a tweezer and stretched it It looked like latex He poked a needle through Aaron his arms folded behind his back watched as Gross sewed up the patient Gross started to sing along with the radio Aaron admired how casual and proficient Gross could be at the same time When the operation was over they both sat on the floor against the wall of the operating room waiting for the next patient A black clot of blood the size of a grape seed hung from a finger of one of Grosss gloves When do you stop getting nervous Aaron asked Still shaken by Cohens death he apparently worried about how anxious he felt in the operating room about whether or not his nervousness was an irredeemable fault Gross rubbed the tiny blood clot between his finger and thumb and said the one thing that could calm such anxiety Never When you stop getting nervous youd better stop operating Thats when you stop thinking and start killing people NEXT WEEK On his medical clerkship Aaron Kenigsberg studies the fine points of diagnosis learns how to deal with his patients pain and struggles with the question of what direction medicine should

HATFIELD BILL WOULD BAR FEDERAL ABORTION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/24/us/hatfield-bill-would-bar-federal-abortion-funds.html,Senator Mark O Hatfield a moderate Republican has introduced an antiabortion proposal designed to give permanent form to the prohibitions on Federal financing of abortion enacted in each of the last five years Aides to Mr Hatfield said that that the proposal was designed to unite conservatives who have quarreled over the details of antiabortion legislation The Senate is expected to take up the issue sometime this summer Mr Hatfields bill says that no funds appropriated by Congress may be used to pay for abortions or to refer women for abortions Also no Federal agency could perform an abortion except to protect the life of a pregnant woman Under the bill any person could file a lawsuit to enforce the prohibitions Would Authorize Court Appeal The bill would not overturn the 1973 decision of the Supreme Court upholding a womans right to abortion But in addition to prohibiting Federal money for abortions it would authorize a direct appeal to the Supreme Court if any Federal district judge struck down a state law restricting abortion The Oregon Senator said that he wanted to give the Court an early opportunity to review its 1973 ruling At present direct appeals to the Supreme Court are permitted in only a few situations such as cases in which an act of Congress has been declared unconstitutional Under Federal law a person must bypass the appellate courts if he has a right to appeal directly to the Supreme Court Several lawyers said that the Hatfield proposal would run counter to a trend of the last decade when Congress has repealed several laws permitting direct appeals to the High Court Advocates of abortion rights oppose the Hatfield bill but they say that it probably has a better chance of approval than other antiabortion proposals Hatfield himself gives it an aura of respectability said William W Hamilton Jr director of the Washington office of Planned Parenthood He Supports Nuclear Freeze Mr Hatfield is chairman of the Appropriations Committee He has supported programs for the handicapped and the elderly opposed capital punishment and cosponsored a resolution calling for a freeze on the testing production and deployment of nuclear weapons Unlike some opponents of abortion Mr Hatfield has been a strong supporter of family planning programs The Senator said that the fight over Federal financing of abortion had tied up appropriation bills for too long His proposal he said is designed to get this matter off the back of the Appropriations Committee The bill does not address the question of when human life begins But it declares Unborn children who are subjected to abortion are living members of the human species One of Several Proposals The Hatfield bill is one of several antiabortion proposals pending in Congress Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina has introduced a bill that includes all the restrictions of the Hatfield bill but goes further to declare that human life exists from the moment of conception Judie A Brown president of the American Life Lobby an antiabortion group asserted that the Hatfield bill was inferior to the Helms bill because it did not explicitly address the question whether a fetus was a person Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah has proposed a constitutional amendment that would enable Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortion On March 10 the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 10 to 7 endorsed the measure which Mr Hatch calls the human life federalism amendment The vote marked the first time that a full committee of Congress had supported an antiabortion amendment The Hatch proposal would overturn the Supreme Courts 1973 decision A similar measure has been introduced in the House of Representatives but the House Judiciary Committee has not taken action on it Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee another antiabortion group said For almost a year the movement has internally debated whether to support the Hatch or Helms proposal Now he said the movement is rapidly coming together in favor of both
JUSTICES AGREE TO ACT ON RULES IMPEDING ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/25/us/justices-agree-to-act-on-rules-impeding-abortions.html,The Supreme Court set the stage today for an important test of womens ability to exercise their constitutional right to obtain abortions Setting five separate appeals for argument in the next term the Justices agreed to rule on the constitutionality of an array of obstacles that state and local governments have placed in the path of access to legal abortions The obstacles range from hospitalization requirements to parental consent to 24hour waiting periods The cases before the Court involve laws in Virginia Missouri and Akron Ohio which in 1978 enacted a wideranging ordinance intended by its sponsors to be a national model for local regulation of abortion Among other things the ordinance requires a doctor before performing an abortion to warn the patient that the procedure can result in severe emotional disturbances and to tell her that the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception 2 Appeals in Akron Case In a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union a Federal appeals court struck down most aspects of the Akron ordinance but upheld one section requiring all abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy to be performed in a hospital The Justices today agreed to hear both the citys appeal on the sections that were invalidated and the civil liberties unions appeal on the hospitalization requirement The Justices set a total of three hours for argument in the five cases The argument will probably take place next winter with decisions unlikely before a year from now Todays action therefore assures that the Court will have the politically explosive abortion issue under active consideration as Congress considers various measures to overrule the Courts landmark 1973 decision Roe v Wade which legalized abortion in the United States Limited Impact Is Seen None of the five cases appear to give the Court a vehicle for reconsidering the fundamental premise of Roe v Wade In that decision the Court declared that the right to have an abortion is an aspect of the right to privacy protected by the due process clause of the Constitution and that at least in the first trimester of pregnancy the government may not interfere In the second third of pregnancy the Court said the government may interfere only to the extent necessary to protect the womans health The current cases involve efforts not to overrule Roe v Wade but rather to blunt its impact by making access to abortion financially or emotionally burdensome or generally more entangled with red tape than other medical procedures The approach is fairly widespread For example 20 states including New York and New Jersey have hospitalization requirements for secondtrimester abortions The question for the Justices will be whether these obstacles reach the level of impermissible burdens on the exercise of a constitutional right In the nine years since Roe v Wade the Court has decided more than a dozen abortion cases and has resisted several opportunities to cut back on the 1973 ruling Its only decisions that have satisfied opponents of abortion have been those ruling that the state and Federal governments need not pay for abortions for poor women The Court has also indicated somewhat ambiguously that teenaged girls may in some circumstances be required to obtain their parents or a judges consent before having an abortion But on the issue of access to abortion by adult women the Court has consistently reaffirmed Roe v Wade and invalidated a number of procedural impediments set up by state legislatures The Justices apparently had considerable difficulty deciding how to handle the five appeals that they granted today The Virginia case was docketed last July and has been before the Court since the current term opened last October The other cases have also been on the docket for months It is not known how often the Justices actually discussed the cases or what options they might have been considering other than full hearings on the merits Following are descriptions of the individual cases and the issues they raise Virginia Simopoulos v Virginia No 81185 is a challenge to the states hospitalization requirement for second trimester abortions brought by an obstetriciangynecologist who was convicted of inducing an abortion in a 17yearold woman who came to his office when she was 16 weeks pregnant The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the requirement and the doctors conviction Missouri The Missouri Legislature passed a comprehensive antiabortion statute in 1979 that was challenged in Federal court by Planned Parenthood The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the parental consent portion of the law which permits socalled emancipated minors to get abortions on their own but requires the consent of one parent for an unemancipated minor Alternatively a state judge can decide whether an abortion is in the best interest of an unemancipated minor Planned Parenthood appealed that ruling Planned Parenthood v Ashcroft No 811255 At the same time the state appealed another aspect of the appeals courts ruling that struck down the secondtrimester hospitalization requirement Ashcroft v Planned Parenthood No 811623 Akron The city is appealing aspects of a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that struck down a parental consent requirement a 24hour waiting period and a requirement that the doctor counsel by stressing the anatomy and perceptual abilities of the fetus and warning about the dangers of abortion The city is also appealing the Sixth Circuits ruling that any impediment to abortion must be justified by a compelling state interest rather than simply a rational basis Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health No 81746 At the same time the plaintiffs a group of doctors represented by the American Civil Liberties Union challenge the Sixth Circuits upholding of the citys hospitalization requirement for second trimester abortions In their appeal they note that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists citing new medical evidence amended their standards early this year to permit abortions early in the second trimester to be performed in clinics rather than hospitals Akron Center v Akron No 811172

Fetus Memorial Service Is Endorsed by Reagan,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/27/us/fetus-memorial-service-is-endorsed-by-reagan.html,President Reagan has endorsed a plan by antiabortion advocates to conduct a memorial service for nearly 17000 fetuses and embryos discovered earlier this year in a repossessed shipping container the White House said today An Administration spokesman said that Mr Reagan who has long opposed abortion expressed support for the proposed memorial service in a May 5 letter to Dr Philip Dreisbach a Palms Springs Calif physician who is secretary of the California Pro Life Medical Association Your decision to hold a memorial service for these children is most fitting and proper Mr Reagan said in the letter On such an occasion we must strengthen our resolve to end this national tragedy The President told the doctor whose organization represents about 1000 physicians opposed to abortion that he would probably not be able to accept an invitation to attend the service but added I am hopeful that evidence like that found in California will move those who have thus far preferred silence or inaction and encourage them to agree that something must be done The huge container had been repossessed from the backyard of Melvin Weisberg the owner of a nowdefunct medical laboratory in Santa Monica Calif Three weeks later investigators found hundreds more fetuses and embryos at Mr Weisbergs home
BELL-FENWICK PRIMARY POSING TOUGH CHOICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/nyregion/bell-fenwick-primary-posing-tough-choices.html,Luther M Smythe is the model of a modern Republican He is loyal to his party and his President conservative in most matters at home and abroad He has voted in every primary election in New Jersey since 1951 and he will be at the polls again on June 8 to help select the Republican candidate for the United States Senate But oh how he is twisting at the thought of that task Theres no use hiding in a dark corner and not talking about it said Mr Smythe a 71yearold resident of Berkeley Heights It puts everybody on the horns of a dilemma For many of the 300000 Republicans who are expected to take part in the June 8 voting the primary presents a dilemma of one sort or another The contest pits Jeffrey Bell of Leonia against Representative Millicent Fenwick of Bernardsville  candidates with two distinct styles and philosophies  and in some quarters the race is seen as a referendum on the policies of the Reagan Administration On the one hand Mr Smythe would vote for Mr Bell a fellow conservative and one of the architects of President Reagans economic strategy Mr Bell was the political insurgent who lost to Bill Bradley in the 1978 Senate race but in the primary that year defeated the late Clifford P Case a 24year fixture in the upper house Philosophy vs Risk On the other hand Mr Smythe would chose Representative Fenwick a moderate who follows her own counsel rather than that of party leaders an engaging septuagenarian and a durable politician who has never lost an election Philosophically I lean to Bell Mr Symthe said But Ive been talking with a lot of people and the feeling is Fenwick would win easy in November and he would not so maybe we should vote for Fenwick from a risk standpoint Its an issue you cant duck The two candidates combined might spend as much as 25 million in the primary Mrs Fenwick the clear frontrunner in both candidates polls is trying to run above the campaign and lessen the conflict while Mr Bell is trying to pull her into the fray and broaden the scope of the fight Mr Bell 38 years old moved to New Jersey in 1976 to woo conservatives and unseat the liberal Mr Case He had served in the 1968 campaign of Richard M Nixon as a speech writer and researcher then became political director of the American Conservative Union In 1974 he joined Governor Reagans staff working on Mr Reagans Presidential campaign in 1976 Victory Over Case Mr Bells unexpected and narrow victory in the 1978 primary  he won by 3473 votes out of a total of 233637 cast  startled everyone except Mr Bell Conservatives had been ignored in New Jersey he said It was a state where it was possible to move into a vacuum This year he is again running against a fourterm Washington veteran  Mrs Fenwick was first elected to the House in 1974  and like Mr Case she is clearly to the political left of Mr Bell Yet most of the similarities end there Mr Case conducted an indifferent campaign and refused the advice of his strategists Mrs Fenwick on the other hand is making vigorous use of all the political tools available In 1978 Mr Bells central theme was tax cuts to revitalize the economy This year he has again structured his campaign around an economic issue high interest rates In clear welldelivered speeches at each stop along the campaign trail his message is the same High interest rates and a declining economy are the result of the policies of the Federal Reserve Board Change the policies of the board and restrict its ability to control the money supply he argues and interest rates will drop At Odds With Reagan Politically this seems to put Mr Bell at odds with the President whose advisers say that high interest rates are linked to budget deficits Yet on all other issues Mr Bell is a Reaganite and his televison commercials and mail advertisements try to drive that point home Some people would say that this is a big contradiction that Im antiReagan on monetary policy Mr Bell said I dont think so In a sense taking a postion that Reagan is not yet at is the most proReagan thing I can do His strategy is to try to convince voters that his economic idea is more important to the Republican cause than Mrs Fenwicks obvious popularity and appeal You dont try to compete with the charm of somebody like that he said On television and in direct mail campaigns he has tried to paint Mrs Fenwick as a liberal a legislator who as one radio advertisement trumpets would be Reagans greatest Republican opponent in the Senate This tactic has the Fenwick camp crying foul Ive never been in a thing like this said Mrs Fenwick It takes your breath away Im not as mild a person as I would like to be but you might as well not get down in the mud Mrs Fenwick 72 years old has served as a State Assemblywoman as director of the State Division of Consumer Affairs and as a freethinking member of the House Im not a rubber stamp for anybody she said Were All Middle Class She won her last election with 78 percent of the popular vote A wealthy woman  her assests are estimated at 5 million  she comes from the rolling hills and estate country of Somerset County but I hate the patrician label she said Were all American middle class Her Old World manner  she often begins her conversations with my dear  and personal habits have made the phrase pipesmoking grandmother a standard in this politcal season But the constant description rankles her Ive never been defeated she said and you dont do that if youre just some kind of a lightweight who is nothing but a pipe and a grandmother Like Mr Bell she too has tried to position herself next to the President She points out that she voted for his tax and budget cuts and supported last years final defense appropriations measure But on other issues the candidates are split Mrs Fenwick for example supports the proposed equal rights amendment federally financed abortions and busing to achieve racial balance in public schools Mr Bell is opposed to these measures She favors national registration of handguns and Mr Bell does not Prayer and Punishment Mr Bell says that voluntary prayer in the public schools should be a community or home rule option Mrs Fenwick says she will study the United States Supreme Court decision on this issue before she makes up her mind On capital punishment Mrs Fenwick denies Mr Bells claim that she once lobbied against the death penalty She says she has never been opposed to the death penalty on principle but wants a judge rather than a jury to impose it Mr Bell supports capital punishment Though both candidates polls show Mrs Fenwick clearly ahead  hers by a 2to1 margin  Mr Bell said his poll conducted in the third week in May shows very encouraging movement in our favor He did not however provide details Mr Bell expects to spend between 15 million and 2 million on the primary campaign with roughly two thirds of the money coming from out of state contributors including political action groups Mrs Fenwick estimates that her campaign expenses will be at least 500000 So far she has used 125000 of her own money Looking for a Sweep Though Mr Bell has picked up the support of some politcal leaders in New Jersey most have cast their lot with Mrs Fenwick I think most of the chairmen are worried about their courthouses said Philip Matalucci chairman of the New Jersey State County Chairmens Association The feeling is that Millicent can reach the greatest number of voters The name of the game is to have a Republican sweep in November Still in 1978 Mr Bell had almost no party support and won How active theyre going to be this year remains to be seen he said The US Senate seat is not a high patronage item so its not something their going to knock themselves out for Governor Kean has remained neutral in the contest and so has the White House But according to a recent survey a Presidential endorsement might not help either candidate A poll conducted in March by the Eagleton Institute of Politics shows that the Presidents performace rating in the state is down among members of his own party In October 27 percent of the Republicans surveyed gave him an excellent rating while in March only 18 percent put him in that category Though the campaign did not formally begin until January the two candidates began circling each other early last year Both confirm that Mr Bell went to Mrs Fenwicks Washington office to try to persuade her not to run And according to Mr Bell Mrs Fenwick reciprocated in typical political fashion I found out he said that she went to the House leadership and said We have this nice young man named Jeff Bell and couldnt we get him a job down here 
NUNS' GROUP OPPOSES ABORTION STRATEGY OF BISHOPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/us/nuns-group-opposes-abortion-strategy-of-bishops.html,A small but significant division has emerged in the Roman Catholic Churchs strategy for overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made most abortions legal In a littlenoted statement the leadership of the 1800member National Coalition of American Nuns announced its opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment that the Catholic bishops prefer among various proposals to make abortion illegal What is notable about the nuns position however is not their opposition to the proposal but their implicit support for a womans right to make a choice in the matter While we continue to oppose abortion in principal and in practice we are likewise convinced that the responsibility for decisions in this regard resides primarily with those who are directly and personally involved the nuns said First Break With Policy It is believed to be the first time a group of Catholics institutionally related to the church has diverged from the bishops view that the Supreme Court decision must be overturned Although the statement was adopted by the 24member board of the nuns coalition in midApril it is only now gaining circulation among church members and groups The proposal for the amendment sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah would grant authority to Congress and the state legislatures to restrict or prohibit abortion It received the strong backing of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops at their annual meeting last November Some people in the antiabortion movement are sharply critical of the proposal believing it does not go far enough in protecting the personhood of the fetus Some also oppose the measure because it would allow states to establish varying abortion laws State Differences Cited The nuns organization cited the potentially wide differences in state approaches to abortion legislation as part of their reason for opposing the Hatch proposal The organization said that it debated the abortion issue for 13 years and we remain firmly opposed to abortion as such But the statement underscored the coalitions divergence in stating that abortion was not an eitheror proposition A spokesman for the bishops conference said it had no comment The nuns statement urged leaders in the churches the courts and Congress to provide a more nurturing environment so that women will be encouraged to bring new life into the world They See a Paradox It is paradoxical to us that the same leaders who are currently demanding that women bring their babies to term are simulataneously voting to cut off food stamps child nutrition programs and related benefits essential for the health and wellbeing of our children they said At the same time the nuns urged women everywhere to disavow the use of abortion as a normative means of birth control and said women should educate themselves in ways of being creatively responsible  insofar as this is possible  for avoiding unwanted pregnancies It also called on men to educate themselves on the responsibilities of fatherhood Intercourse must be seen by men as only the beginning of a solemn and holy relationship the nuns said and fatherhood as a role which requires continued nurturance and material assistance to the mother and child
STUDY FINDS STEEP DROP IN REPRODUCTIVE DEATHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/us/study-finds-steep-drop-in-reproductive-deaths.html,The total number of women who died in pregnancy or in efforts to avert pregnancy or childbirth has decreased dramatically in recent decades according to a report published in todays issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association Over the same period the report said deaths caused by contraception or sterilization have begun to occur at nearly the same rate as they do from pregnancy itself The lesson to be drawn from the data the report said is that health problems associated with birth control must receive increased attention not because such practices have become more dangerous but because they are being used by more women The study by Federal epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta is believed to be the first to have been done in this country on both birth control practices and the complications of pregnancy Women Are Much Better Off In 1975 for American women 15 to 44 years old there were 999 deaths from pregnancy and reproductionrelated complications This figure contrasted with 1986 deaths in 1965 and 2703 in 1955 The numbers represented 2 percent of all deaths of women in that age group in 1975 4 percent in 1965 and 6 percent in 1955 Women are really much better off now Dr Peter M Layde one of the authors said in an interview There are a lot fewer reproductive deaths than there were 25 years ago Health experts cite many reasons for the decline in deaths which included advances in prenatal and obstetrical care improvements in the general health of pregnant women the increasing tendency for women to have small families and to complete their childbearing at relatively young ages and the legalization of abortion Since 1973 when abortion became legal in this country abortionrelated deaths have decreased by 73 percent The report said that 99 percent of all deaths related to reproduction in 1955 were due to complications in pregnancy and all the remaining deaths were due to sterilization Birth control pills were not prescribed in the United States until 1960 Five years later 15 percent of deaths related to reproduction were from complications of contraception In 1975 the figure was 47 percent with oral contraceptives specifically accounting for 452 deaths or 45 percent of all reproductive deaths in this country Dr Layde said that the most common potentially fatal side effects of oral contraceptive use were heart attacks strokes and other cardiovascular diseases A number of studies conducted over the last five to 10 years Dr Layde said show that that risk is concentrated in a very small subgroup of women on the pill  those 35 and older particularly those who smoke Women who are 35 and older and who smoke probably account for about 3 percent of all women using contraceptives in the United States Dr Layde said but they account for onethird to onehalf of all the deaths from oral contraceptives Dr Layde and his coworkers said We recommend that national surveillance of maternal mortality be expanded to include deaths related to pregnancy prevention metthods At present such reports are generally limited to deaths in pregnancy Measure of Womens Health Maternal mortality has long been considered an important indicator of womens health The rate excluding birth controlrelated deaths has dropped spectacularly to the point where it is about onetwentieth of what it was 100 years ago in England and Wales Dr Valerie Beral of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine introduced the term reproductive mortality rate in 1979 in a study published in the British Medical Journal The term includes the number of deaths due to such factors as spontaneous and induced abortions adverse effects of contraception and complications of pregnancy delivery and the puerperium the period just after childbirth The epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control used the term reproductive mortality rate in studying the changes in the United States for each of three years 1955 1965 and 1975 They selected 1975 because it was the last year for which complete data were available and other other years were selected for purposes of comparison Dr Layde said According to the CDC study this rate dropped by 73 percent from 1955 to 1975  from 78 deaths per 100000 women aged 15 to 44 in 1955 to 21 deaths in 1975 The decrease was greater for women younger than 35 The smaller decline for women 35 and older was attributed to the greater number of deaths related to oral contraceptives If that small fraction of women either quit smoking or used an alternative method of contraception that would have a dramatic impact on oral contraceptiverelated deaths and ultimately the reproductive fatality rate Dr Layde said However he said that for the vast majority of younger women who do not smoke the pill is very safe For most women he continued The risks of contraconception are lower than the risks of childbearing The exception appears to be the risk of oral contraceptives in women 35 and older who smoke For them that risk probably is greater than the risk of childbearing The other authors of the report were Benjamin P Sachs George L Rubin and Dr Roger W Rochat
POPE AND ANGLICAN LEADER PROMISE A NEW UNITY EFFORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/world/pope-and-anglican-leader-promise-a-new-unity-effort.html,Pope John Paul II and the Archbishop of Canterbury announced plans today to set up an international commission to study steps that could lead toward eventual reunion between the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches After an ecumenical service at Canterbury Cathedral the mother church of the Anglican Communion the Pope and the Archbishop the Most Rev Robert Runcie signed the common pledge to move in faith and hope towards the unity for which we long On the second day of his sixday visit to Britain the Pope also said an openair mass before 80000 people in Wembley Stadium leading them in a prayer for peace in the South Atlantic Let us pray for all those who have died on both sides in the Falklands conflict and for all those who are imperiled said the Pope who has mentioned the fighting in several prayers since his arrival here Friday morning And let us beseech our loving Father to give His peace to the world First Visit by a Pope The service in Canterbury  where in 1170 Thomas a Becket the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury was murdered by the knights of King Henry II  was the spiritual highlight of John Pauls visit the first ever made to this country by a reigning Pope The Pope and the Archbishop exchanged a kiss of peace and prayed side by side in a symbolic move toward healing the schism in which King Henry VIII broke the English church away from Roman Catholicism 450 years ago Clearly moved by the historical significance of the occasion the Pope called the ancient cathedral an eloquent witness both to our long years of common inheritance and to the sad years of division that followed I appeal to you in this holy place he said all my fellow Christians and especially the members of the Church of England and the members of the Anglican Communion throughout the world to accept the commitment to which Archbishop Runcie and I pledge ourselves anew before you today May the dialogue we have begun lead us to the day of full restoration of unity in faith and love The joint declaration that the two churchmen signed afterward which had been expected was part of a process that began in 1966 when Pope Paul VI and the Most Rev Michael Ramsey then the Archbishop of Canterbury opened what they called a serious dialogue about the theological and practical issues that separate the two churches Vatican Cool to Joint Report In March after 12 years of study a joint AnglicanCatholic commission issued a report that was received coolly at the Vatican That report did not deal substantively with some of the most divisive issues between the two churches such as abortion birth control and divorce But today in their declaration which they signed on a plain wooden table in the warm sunshine of the garden outside the cathedral the Pope and the Archbishop looked hopefully forward to the work of the new commission Its ultimate task they said will be to recommend what practical steps will be necessary when on the basis of our unity in faith we are able to proceed to the restoration of full communion The mass in London on the eve of Pentecost was held in Wembley Stadium which was the scene Thursday night of the Football Association Cup Final a kind of world series of professional soccer Since the final whistle of that game work had proceeded feverishly around the clock to transform the stadium into an openair cathedral Architects had designed a 44ton prefabricated altar podium which was bolted into place and they covered the soccer field with canvas to make a place in front of the Pope for the 2500 priests who assisted him in the mass Thousands of people heard the mass over loudspeakers in the parking lots and thousands more lined the Popes route in and out of the stadium He was frequently interrupted by applause during the mass Roar of Cheering and Applause At the end of his homily he said O Lord how manifold are all Your works When You send forth Your spirit they are created and You renew the face of the earth Then there was a roar of cheering and applause When he moved to leave the stadium the people jumped to their feet singing waving flags and cheering almost like an audience at a rock concert But as was the case Friday on some of the Popes trips through London there were places where the sidewalks were nearly empty and where crowdcontrol barriers erected by the police were unnecessary There has been little overt hostility to the Popes visit but a Conservative Member of Parliament Robert Adley today called his repeated appeals for peace in the South Atlantic naive To live under a dictatorship may be peaceful but it is unacceptable to free men he said of the Argentine occupation of the Falklands
LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/nyregion/long-island-journal-172135.html,WHY would an international group of scholars meet at a Long Island home to discuss the Russian avantgarde Because David Burliuk one of the leaders of the CuboFuturist movement spent the last 26 years of his life in Hampton Bays surrounded by art works and mementos of the days when he and his friends shocked and offended the public with their experimental paintings poetry films and theatrical events Friday and yesterday scholars from as far afield as Japan Italy and Sweden gathered in Lloyd Harbor at Dark Hollow home of Ella Jaffe Freidus a longtime friend of Burliuk and collector of his work to celebrate the centenary of his birth in the same iconoclastic spirit The conference titled A Slap in the Face of Public Taste after a book of Futurist poetry was organized by John E Bowlt director of the Institute of Modern Russian Culture in Blue Lagoon Tex This was the first effort to examine Burliuks seminal role in the prerevolutionary avantgarde and to evaluate his impact on art in Japan where he lived for two years before coming to the United States in 1922 According to Professor Bowlt Burliuk was often maligned and misunderstood by his colleagues and by contemporary critics especially as the result of his expansive behavior He was nevertheless a key force in the evolution of the Russian avantgarde the achievements of CuboFuturism are unthinkable without his boisterous presence The two days of presentations including a mime performance poetry declamation and showing of rare Futurist films in addition to scholarly papers were culminated by A Tango With Cows a Futurist ball in costume Guests including Mr and Mrs David Burliuk Jr of Huntington and Mr and Mrs Nicholas Burliuk of Hampton Bays arrived in Cubist Futurist and Constructivist dress with painted faces geometric jumpsuits Martian headgear and all manner of outrageous attire appropriate to the event Dancing was to arrangements of 1920 Russian jazz Mrs Freidus in a copy of a Popovadesigned cape and dress topped by a stovepipe hat and lorgnette a la Burliuk described the celebration as a cosmic happening Larry Cantwell the Democrats biggest votegetter in the Town of East Hampton is leaving the political arena The twoterm member of the Town Board is resigning to take the nonelective post of clerktreasurer of the Village of East Hampton It was a combination of things Mr Cantwell said After almost six years in town government you tend to get worn down a bit and the bottom line is that Im not willing to make the sacrifices  financial as well as time away from family and friends  that it requires The village job  which is considered a lifetime appointment as long as its done well Mr Cantwell said  pays 22000 a year as Councilman he makes 18000 His move caught political friends and foes alike by surprise Mary Fallon a Republican who defeated him in a bitterly fought election last fall for Town Supervisor said his resignation was so unexpected that the Republicans who have three of the five Council seats have not taken any steps in naming his replacement The committeemen are checking it out seeing who would like the appointment she said and I guess we will have a meeting soon Id like the bestqualified person and I believe there will be some input from the Democrats The appointee must run in a special election in November to fill the unexpired term which goes through 1983 To Randy Parsons Mr Cantwells Democratic colleague on the board the decision though understandable will mean a considerable loss In the long run however Mr Parsons said it could have a positive effect on his party Weve been so disorganized and fractured lately he said and now we will have to take steps to revolutionize ourselves and get together Another chapter in an unusual election case John T Cain of Bethpage was sentenced in Nassau County Court last week to a 1500 fine and 750 hours of community service after his conviction on two misdemeanors falsification of an official document in this case election designating petitions and election misconduct Mr Cains legal problems began with what seemed to be a routine challenge of the renomination of State Senator Ralph J Marino in the 1980 Republican primary Mr Cain collecting designating petitions obtained some signatures in which a wife signed for her husband as well as herself He initially denied such actions the basis for a perjury charge that was dismissed but eventually admitted that some family members signed for others contending that this was a common practice He refused pleabargaining efforts by the Nassau District Attorneys office and was convicted of the two misdemeanor counts Mr Cain an antiabortion activist and New York City public school teacher said he was appealing his conviction He said that his friends and supporters would hold a fundraiser to pay the fine if necessary but that he did not know what kind of community service he would perform if the conviction and sentence are upheld
Ideas & Trends in Summary; At Risk From Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-at-risk-from-contraceptives.html,Both pregnancy and the ending of pregnancy through abortion have become significantly safer over the last 15 years or so according to a study published last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association At the same time however a statistic has emerged on deaths from contraceptive use that is becoming a matter of concern to physicians The study by Federal epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reported that while deaths from pregnancy decreased by almost 50 percent from 1685 in 1965 to 527 in 1975 deaths from contraceptive use increased at nearly the same rate from 301 to 472 although notably among a much larger population About 32 million women aged 15 to 44 were using contraceptives in 1975 there were only about 5 million pregnant women in the United States at that time Oral contraceptives seem chiefly to blame particularly when used by women 35 and older who smoke They constitute about 3 percent of all women using contraceptives in the United States said Dr Peter M Layde one of the studys authors But they account for onethird to onehalf of all deaths from oral contraceptives with heart attacks strokes and other cardiovascular diseases often the immediate cause of death If that small fraction of women either quit smoking or used an alternative method of contraception that would have a dramatic impact on oral contraceptiverelated deaths and ultimately on the reproductive fatality rate Dr Layde said The epidemiologists compiled data on childbearingrelated deaths for 1955 1965 and 1975  the last year for which complete data were available Oral contraceptives however were not prescribed in the United States until 1960
A REPORT FROM PEKING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/books/a-report-from-peking.html,CHINA Alive in the Bitter Sea By Fox Butterfield Illustrated 468 pp New York Times Books 1995 IN 1979 Fox Butterfield became the first New York Times correspondent to be based in Peking in 30 years For the next two years while China cast off the fetters of more than a decade of cultural revolution and wrestled with the legacy of Mao he was there giving Americans a firsthand view of China Educated in East Asian studies at Harvard apprenticed in Hong Kong and Taiwan and fluent in Chinese he traveled to remote areas of the country visited the people in their homes climbed sacred mountains spoke with top leaders by day and met with dissidents at night What he had to report was not pleasant and this book based on his experiences in China is not always pleasant After 10 years of Pollyannaish accounts by others Mr Butterfield and a few fellow American journalists have sent back messages of disappointment and despair China is poor China is autocratic China is complicated and beset by massive problems that defy simple solution China does not make it easy for outsiders to penetrate the various layers of her reality China is dazzling in her uniqueness yet banal in her backwardness China is nearly a superpower but her per capita income is less than 200 a year China is a nation of survivors whose faith in Communism has been irrevocably shaken men and women with broken careers and lost families cynical party members innocent victims denied justice disenchanted young people enduring two decades of turmoil individuals sacrificed to a system that is out of control Ones heart goes out to Lihua a young woman whom Mr Butterfield befriends She tells him I wont be happy till I die Ive never lived a good day in my life My mother was beaten to death my father was left senseless and I still have to beg for everything  My scars will never heal Mr Butterfields view of China is gloomy and reminiscent of standard accounts of life in the Soviet Union He describes an economy in permanent crisis where per capita grain production has not increased since the mid1950s where reforms make no palpable impact where outmoded management responds poorly to the demands of modernization Within such a system inequities abound and are perpetuated by an alliance of party army and police that arbitrarily makes decisions and maintains control for the elite Sudden and unorthodox movements are dangerous Everybody is keeping an eye on somebody else Its best to go with the flow and keep quiet  not exactly the stuff of which industrialization is made A Peking University professor tells Mr Butterfield If you are not overly ambitious and dont have any political troubles life in China is pleasant like living on a slowmoving conveyor belt The system cannot cope with Chinas massive population nor apparently is it capable of stimulating the rapid economic growth required for a modernization breakthrough YET amid the grimness there are rays of hope If the Socialist system has degenerated there is still the positive legacy of Chinese culture and the strength of those individuals who dare to step forth and tell their stories to foreigners Wellmeaning leaders are developing pragmatic policies in an attempt to salvage the Chinese revolution if not to restore Chinas greatness Also significant gains have been made since 1949 a doubling of life expectancy the attainment of literacy for hundreds of millions of people a better distribution of resources elimination of foreign domination Despite his pessimism Mr Butterfield occasionally evinces the hope that somehow China can still right herself not as was wantonly promised during the Cultural Revolution but through a more cautious form of development No matter how bitter the Chinese sea may be it is still alive for Mr Butterfield His book which is imaginatively organized conveys his concern for the individual Chinese he meets He divides his book into five sections that cut to the heart of daily life in China Connections Passages Systems Persuasions and Messages In Connections he introduces us to the ways in which Chinese relate to foreigners and to each other from taking the back door getting scarce goods through sheer ingenuity to the giant flight of stairs a principle that acknowledges that beneath this facade of the classless society  some people are much more equal than others In Passages Mr Butterfield discusses the various stages of life from childrearing practices through love sex marriage abortion divorce and old age The underlying theme is that with some exceptions Chinese passages are rather like ours Bing one of Mr Butterfields Chinese friends reads Gail Sheehys Passages and then tells him It was a revelation I was really going through a crisis and it showed me there are turning points in your life I fit right in to what Sheehy called Catch 30  The section on Systems Mr Butterfields strongest is reminiscent of some of the best parts of Hedrick Smiths The Russians a book that Mr Butterfield clearly would like to emulate Drawing upon his long experience reporting on Chinese economic development supplemented by his personal observations and by Western scholarly accounts Mr Butterfield provides an excellent analysis of contemporary Chinese agriculture industry and bureaucratic structure We see how these systems work and also why they respond so poorly to change We meet Chinese officials who say We are having trouble defining what our system is We are trying a number of experiments Those that work we will call Socialism Those that dont we will call Capitalism The last two sections Persuasions and Messages describe the pervasiveness of the Chinese system of control and the meager ways in which Chinese individuals can resist the persuasions of those in power Comparison with the Soviet Union is unavoidable and Mr Butterfield finds himself trying to separate Chinese and Soviet experience even while referring to a Chinese gulag and to control techniques that for the most part resemble those of the Soviet Union Yet he notes that no Chinese Solzhenitsyn or Sakharov has appeared and that Chinese dissent may be of a somewhat different stripe Im a patriot not a dissident says Tan a Columbiatrained economist I can see many faults But Im not a dissident because the present system is the best we have there is no viable alternative to Deng It would be traitorous of me to jeopardize our modernization DESTINED for a wide audience this book will undoubtedly influence American perceptions of China It is informative disturbing poignant and absorbing It is based on a range of personal encounters with individual Chinese that are almost unprecedented for any American journalist in recent times It is a testament to Mr Butterfields skill in reporting his training in Chinese studies and his personal commitment to China However in looking to him for the final word about China we should proceed with caution As a foreigner and a journalist his experiences were extremely limited The bulk of his reporting was confined to a few Chinese cities He was basically isolated from the lives of Chinas 800 million rural dwellers From his arrival until the day he left his movements were monitored He was an important foreign friend an outsider who was constantly followed Those Chinese whom he managed to befriend often were the desperate outsiders the alienated Westernized elements We should stop and ask whether Mr Butterfields disaffected Chinese friends do justice to the mainstream of Chinese who may be relatively satisfied with their system and with their present lot in life Encounters between Westerners and Chinese have been unusual and painful over the centuries It seems the more the Chinese resisted Westernization  the more exotic and remote China became How many Americans have tried to discover the truth about China and how many different truths have they found Yesterdays revolutionary simplicity gives way to todays oppressive Chinese totalitarianism as described by Mr Butterfield What will tomorrow bring Since the cultural revolution China has been rendered less remote more tangible and vulnerable somewhat more comprehensible to foreigners Is this the image Chinese leaders want Americans to see and the one Americans prefer to have of China One recalls Jerry Rubins remarks to Mr Butterfield after Mr Rubins visit to China in 1979 One day as I was riding on a bus I said to myself either everyone is telling the truth or everyone is pulling my leg It came to me that everyone must be telling the truth Given our past encounters with China how could he have been so sure Perhaps there is no one great truth that Westerners can find in China only that she is big and poor and old and struggling to reclaim a unique cultural tradition by means of a terribly painful revolution that is still far from complete
In Memoriam,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/opinion/in-memoriam.html,If the district attorneys office releases the remains a memorial service is to be held in Los Angeles for 17000 aborted fetuses and embryos recovered from the backyard of a Santa Monica medical laboratory President Reagan will probably not attend but he says in a letter to the California Pro Life Medical Association Your decision to hold a memorial service for these children is most fitting and proper On such an occasion we must strengthen our resolve to end this national tragedy Mr Reagan is correct Americas high abortion rate does constitute a national tragedy More than a million women  victims of contraceptive failure or ignorance or recipients of the knowledge that they are carrying a damaged fetus  chose to terminate their pregnancies in 1981 That is their right but nonetheless a decision they are invariably reluctant to make Given the cutbacks in funds for Federal family planning programs and the Reagan Administrations proposed Squeal Rule even more women might have to make it That assumes of course that they dont lose the constitutional right to do so which since 1973 has decreased abortionrelated deaths by 73 percent Many people however think women should lose it among them the President who endorses a fetus memorial service Perhaps Mr Reagan would endorse another service as well a memorial to the millions of women who died because of backalley abortions All Americans should want to join a ceremony that mourns our female ancestors And if safe legal abortion does not remain the American womans right we may be mourning our descendants as well

POPE SPEAKS ON THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/01/world/pope-speaks-on-the-sanctity-of-marriage.html,Pope John Paul II reminded British Catholics today of the sanctity of marriage and condemned divorce contraception and abortion The Pope told a crowd estimated at more than 200000 people squeezed into the Knavesmire Racecourse that marriage was an unbreakable alliance and that the future of society rested on family bonds While praising positive developments in family life the Pope who has taken a firm conservative line on many social issues said he could not fail to draw attention to the negative phenomena In particular he cited a corruption of the idea and experience of freedom with consequent selfcenteredness in human relations serious misconceptions regarding the relationship between parents and children the growing number of divorces the scourge of abortion the spread of a contraceptive and antilife mentality The site where the Pope spoke was near the place where more than 50 Catholics were executed between 1537 and 1680 on the Tyburn as it was then called for failing to accept the Act of Supremacy of 1536 which made it high treason to refuse King Henry VIII as supreme head of the Church of England Three Stops in a Hectic Day For the Pope the appearance in the north of England was one of three stops in a fourth hectic 14hour day on his sixday visit As on other days the crowds were smaller than expected Only 200000 people turned up here instead of the one million predicted Its simply wonderful said Edna Innes 66 years old who traveled to York from Northumberland about 100 miles away That His Holiness has come all this way to see us is the greatest thing that could have happened to us she said In York the Pope departed from his text to appeal once again for peace in the Falklands Let us pray for peace a just and lasting peace he said Clearly tired Pope John Paul nonetheless maintained his practice of greeting as many of those who lined the routes as possible Even though 40 minutes late he paused on his way out of mass here to hold 6monthold Joseph Handley for a minute After three days of perfect spring weather he faced a varying mix of humidity heat and drizzle as he left Liverpool just after 7 AM for Edinburgh where he ended his day at about 930 PM Here in Manchester his first stop he preached at Heaton Park a onesquaremile grassy area just outside this declining industrial city While here ordained 12 priests one of whom was deaf and made an impromptu plea not to forget all those with special needs particularly those who are in prison Youths Hear Him in Edinburgh After York he arrived in late afternoon in Edinburgh where he descended from his British Caledonian BAC111 airplane and kissed the ground his customary gesture upon entering a new country Security was tight as it has been throughout the trip particularly in places where Protestant demonstrations were expected Even bishops and cardinals wore large photoidentification cards on their vestments Protestants demonstrated noisily in Edinburgh and 10 people were arrested John Paul went directly to the Murrayfield Rugby Stadium where 45000 Scottish youths awaited him At almost each stop in the Popes trip the crowds have become more relaxed In Edinburgh the youthful crowd screamed whistled waved banners and shouted John Paul as he addressed them mixing carefully learned Gaelic phrases with his English He warned the group that selfindulgence led to fornication gross indecency and sexual irresponsibility along with feuds and wrangling jealousy bad temper and quarrels envy drunkenness and orgies At the end of his talk the youths began chanting Hes got the whole world in his hands Then they sang Youll never walk alone He Sees Presbyterian Leader For nearly 10 minutes the Pope clearly moved by the reception  stood there occasionally humming along with the crowd Finally he tapped on his microphone to try to quiet the crowd When they finally fell silent he resumed with Young people of Scotland The crowd broke into cheers again and the Pope just smiled When he began to recite the Apostles Creed and the Lords Prayer the group joined in In keeping with the reconciliatory theme of his visit the Pope met early today in Heaton Park with the head of Britains half million Jews and tonight he stopped briefly at the seat of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland to see its leader the Rev John McIntyre It was as the Pope arrived that about 100 Biblecarrying Protestant extremists among them the Rev Ian Paisley tried to push through police barriers Some rolled up their paper pamphlets to hurl at the Popes car The Pope met Professor McIntyre beneath the towering statue of John Knox who led the Scottish Protestant movement in the 16th Century and who was once quoted as calling a Catholic mass worse than a cup of poison
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/02/us/briefing-178463.html,Justice at the Ready T he Department of Justice is braced to intervene in cases involving parents who refuse to authorize medical treatment or feeding that might save the life of a seriously ill child and in which the state and local authorities fail to act Department lawyers are ready to argue when an appropriate case presents itself that such parental refusal constitutes a form of discrimination against the handicapped conduct that is prohibited by Federal laws and regulations where the health and welfare agencies involved receive Federal funds Last month reacting to an Indiana case the Department of Health and Human Services announced that Federal aid would be denied any hospital that refused to provide lifesustaining care for retarded or otherwise handicapped infants The emerging Justice Department policy would carry this a long step further sending the Federal Government into court to keep such children alive Beyond the complex legal questions involved such action would open a political tinderbox In the process the Attorney General would appear to be challenging parents right to deal with their own children violating the basic Administration edict that Washington should not intervene in local and personal affairs and reshaping Government policy to reflect the views of the right to life movement which has expanded its interest beyond the abortion issue Antiabortion groups notified the Justice Department a few weeks ago of a case in Illinois involving an infant with spinal malformation but the parents voluntarily relinquished the child to state care and the first test of Federal legal intervention in such cases was postponed Watts the Problem A tradition of sorts has grown up at the Interior Departments holiday concerts In return for a free outdoor appearance by the National Symphony Orchestra the audience gets to express its opinion of Secretary James G Watt At intermission at the Aaron Copeland concert on the Capitol steps on Memorial Day evening the announcer urged the audience to thank a series of Government officials Names of the Congressional leaders elicited mild rounds of applause but as the list lengthened people began shouting What about Watt Watts the problem inquired the announcer Finally he called the Secretarys name and was rewarded with a crescendo of boos that was even more enthusiastic according to observers than a similar response at the last concert Wright on Lobbyists T he House majority leader Representative Jim Wright of Texas probably knows his lobbyists as well as anyone on the Hill and this is roughly the apocryphal account he gave reporters the other day of how they operate The cheese industry agent of the dairy lobby was given a high priority assignment Get the Lords Prayer amended to read our daily bread and cheese He went straight to the Vatican pleaded the humanitarian case for his depressed clients before the Papal Nuncio and offered a 25000 contribution to the Cardinals Fund Outraged by the lobbyists presumption the Papal Nuncio refused The lobbyist redoubled his arguments for equity and justice and increased his proposed contribution to 50000 Even more resolutely the Papal Nuncio refused to consider the amendment Driven to desperation the lobbyist made his final offer Look well match whatever the bread people have been giving you  Democratic Debt Down P olitical parties dont often experience historic moments between national conventions and campaigns but the Democrats are poised on the brink of one Within the next few days Charles T Manatt the national chairman will announce retirement of the debt that has been depressing party spirits and credit ratings since the dark days of 1968 That year the party agreed to assume the combined primary debts of Hubert H Humphrey Eugene J McCarthy and Robert F Kennedy more than 9 million Through fundraising and negotiation that figure has been slowly reduced to less than 1 million about half owed to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and extinction is now in sight This doesnt mean the Democrats are out of debt entirely rest assured The national committee is carrying something like 1 million in liabilities on its current books including loans of 250000 and 300000 from two Washington banks and several accounts of 50000 or more to service providers After all you dont come up from the bottom of the sea without a pause in the decompression chamber Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr

BELL AND MRS. FENWICK OUTLINE POSITIONS ON ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/04/nyregion/bell-and-mrs-fenwick-outline-positions-on-issues.html,Jeffrey Bell and Millicent Fenwick the two candidates in the June 8 primary for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate have waged a vigorous and expensive campaign that has attracted national attention The New York Times asked both candidates for their stands on various topics and following are excerpts from their replies The Economy MR BELL Essentially the Federal Reserve Boards policy is the ultimate in overregulation The Fed tries to figure out how much money you and I and 230 million Americans should have in our pockets each and every week of the year Neither the Fed nor anyone else is really able to do this but what they have done is use their power over the American banking system to cause recordbreaking credit crunches The greatest need of our nation today is for a complete change in the Federal Reserve Boards monetary policy My plan would cut the discount rate below the market rate begin discounting all commercial paper and halt all openmarket operations This would make credit available so the economy can expand create jobs and allow consumers to purchase cars and homes MRS FENWICK The projected deficits and the resulting high interest rates are the prime problem From a human point of view the loss of jobs must be our chief concern The President most businessmen and many prominent economists all agree that the basic cause of high interest rates is the Federal budget projected for this year and the next two Business confidence is shaken by these huge deficits and the loss of jobs follows Reagan TaxCut Plan MR BELL It must not be tampered with if the economy is to grow I would oppose any effort to disturb the thirdyear tax cut but the present tax code should be further restructured by making it simpler and more equitable The next logical step is to move toward a low flatrate tax replacing the present graduated tax scale A recent study by two Stanford economists shows that at a rate of 16 percent current revenue levels would be maintained The capital gains tax which is a heavy disincentive against small business and on senior citizen investment can be eliminated Such a tax would exempt a family of four earning 12000 or less MRS FENWICK I think it would be unwise to change a plan once it has been officially announced so I tend to oppose deferment of the third year of the tax cut Confidence in consistent longrange planning benefits both consumers and business Many people expect the third year of this cut to go into effect and they are planning on it I understand however that negotiations are under way in certain committees of Congress to change the third year In my view any change must be part of a credible decision to reduce the deficit significantly  not only this year but also in future years  or it should not be made Federal Aid for Abortions MR BELL I oppose Federal funding for abortions MRS FENWICK I support the 1973 Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion under certain circumstances and I do not believe that a medical procedure which is readily avialable to those who have money should be denied to the poor Equal Rights Amendment MR BELL I am in favor of equal rights for women  for example equal pay for equal work I am unconvinced that the ERA would further that goal MRS FENWICK I support the Equal Rights Amendment It was surprising and disappointing to me that support for the amendment was dropped from the Republican Platform in 1980 Capital Punishment MR BELL I believe the need for capital punishment is grounded on the need for a deterrent and the demand for justice or retribution which transcends the issue of deterrence In a democracy where people govern themselves the awful social consequence of breaking the law is sometimes forgotten When democracy punishes criminals it calls to mind our moral obligations as responsible selfgoverning human beings I belive the most powerful means to remind ourselves of the criminal laws moral origin is to restore natures most awesome penalty In this paradoxical way by taking human life society affirms the dignity of human life MRS FENWICK I am not now and never have been opposed in principle to the death penalty It is not necessary to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent to murders for truly vicious murders I think it is an act of justice I have been worried in the past about the reluctance of some juries to convict when they know a heavy penalty such as the death penalty was involved There is a new bill in Trenton which I support that provides for two steps a first to decide guilt or innocence a second to fix the penalty when mitigating or aggravating evidence may be heard Gun Control MR BELL I am opposed to any new federal gun control legislation The real answer to violent crime is not more gun control but more selfcontrol People not guns commit crimes When violent crimes are committed with the use of a gun the penalty for those crimes should be increased I strongly support the concept of local community standards so voters can determine in a democratic way how they wish to treat gun control and a host of other issues MRS FENWICK Our New Jersey laws  which provide for licensing of individuals registration of guns and a mandatory time period between the application for and the granting of a license to prevent emotionally inspired crimes  should be in effect nationwide Unfortunately they are not Nuclear Disarmament Mr Bell I agree with the position of a large majority of Americans according to a recent New York Times poll who support an end to the nuclear arms race The poll shows that a huge majority supports a freeze if US and Soviet nuclear strength is equal but by a 2to1 margin Americans oppose a halt that would in President Reagans words freeze the US into a position of military disadvantage and dangerous vulnerability MRS FENWICK I have been very encouraged by the Presidents obvious interest in nuclear arms control and I have enthusiastically endorsed his call for a balanced mutual and verifiable reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union as outlined in his speech of November 18 1981 and his news conference of March 31 1982 Prayer in Public Schools MR BELL I endorse President Reagans proposed amendment to permit voluntary prayer in public schools I believe the American tradition of 175 years permitting students in public schools to pray is sound and should be restored The Supreme Courts decision to ban public school prayer on First Amendment grounds is a selfcontradiction because the Constitution cannot cut itself off from its own ground which is the Godgiven human right to enjoy freedom and democracy This decision should be made by people in their communities MRS FENWICK I very much regretted the Supreme Courts decision in 1962 which prohibited prayer in the public school Although I was not happy with this decision I do not feel that Congress should try to restrict the power of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution In a society ruled by law we must abide by the Courts decision The question of a constitutional amendment is a more complicated issue and it will require careful study
JERSEYANS TO VOTE TUESDAY IN SENATE PRIMARIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/06/nyregion/jerseyans-to-vote-tuesday-in-senate-primaries.html,A resurgent New Jersey Republican Party will decide a hardfought twoway contest for the partys United States Senate nomination and Democrats will be looking for someone to salvage the Senate seat that was held for 24 years by Harrison A Williams Jr as voters cast ballots in party primaries on Tuesday The Republican contest is between Representative Millicent Fenwick of Bernardsville a popular member of the partys moderate wing and Jeffrey Bell of Leonia a conservative former aide to Ronald Reagan The Democrats will be selecting their standardbearer from among a field of nine many of whom have never held public office Mr Williams resigned earlier this year when faced with possible expulsion by the Senate for his conviction on Abscam bribery charges That and the Republican victory in last years gubernatorial election are believed to have contributed to some indifference among Democratic voters and to a race in which there is no clear favorite The polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM for a turnout that politicians doubt will exceed 25 percent of the 12 million registered Democrats and 780000 Republicans Because of the Democrats reversals in the last two statewide elections fundraising efforts have been a problem for the party Into this breach has stepped political newcomer Frank R Lautenberg of Montclair the chief executive officer of Automatic Data Processing and a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Despite the lack of a political base Mr Lautenberg has become one of the frontrunners through his willingness to spend more than 1 million of his own money  900000 on television alone to capture the nomination He has been campaigning as a business executive with a program for solving economic problems In its final stages the contest has been rated a tossup by most Democratic leaders including the state Democratic chairman James F Maloney They view the top contenders as Mr Lautenberg and two former United States Representatives Andrew Maguire of Ridgewood and Joseph A LeFante of Bayonne However two other candidates have mounted active campaigns and have remained close enough to the leaders to pick up enough support to win the nomination from the large undecided vote that showed up in everyones polls They are Howard Rosen of Millburn a lawyer and a Mercer County Freeholder Barbara Boggs Sigmund the daughter of Representative Corinne Boggs of Louisiana and Hale Boggs who was a longtime Representative from Louisiana The candidates who do not appear to have captured enough popular support to challenge the leaders are Angelo R Bianchi of South Orange a former State Banking Commissioner Councilman Cyril Yannarelli of Paterson a Passaic County Freeholder Frank Forst of Jamesburg a former Mayor and the leader of a union that represents tollroad employees and Richard D McAleer of Ocean Grove a carleasing salesman Reputation as Liberal Mr Maguire earned a reputation as a liberal during his three terms in the House He was defeated in the 1980 elections as Mr Reagan won the Presidency He has attracted support from environmentalists a state coalition of womens groups and some labor unions and is relying on their independent canvassing efforts to augment his own campaign which is anchored in his former Congressional base in Bergen County Mr LeFante who in addition to one term in the House served as a State Assembly Speaker and a member of Governor Brendan T Byrnes Cabinet has the endorsement of the Hudson County Democratic Organization Although it is now only a shadow of the oncevaunted machine headed by Frank Hague and John V Kenny the organization is still an important factor in party primary elections Since the campaign has produced no issues that sharply divide the candidates each has devised a campaign method designed to separate the candidate from the pack and motivate supporters Mr Rosen for example has spent 50 campaign days on a variety of jobs that include ditchdigger security guard sod farmer supermarket clerk fisherman bellhop and hospital orderly and has used films of some of these activites in his television commercials Mrs Sigmund who like Mr LeFante entered the race on the last filing day in April has received financial and campaign support from Washington through her brother Tommy Boggs a wellknown lawyer and fundraiser She abandoned a campaign for a House nomination to run statewide for the Senate and has been able to convert her service as a former president of the New Jersey Association of Counties into a unofficial political network that has produced a number of endorsements She also has attracted some organizedlabor support Issues in GOP Race But while the Democratic race remains a contest of personalities the Republican contest has produced a number of issues that clearly separate Mrs Fenwick the 72yearold fourterm Congresswoman and Mr Bell her 37yearold opponent Mr Bell supports tuition tax credits for families with children in private and parochial schools Mrs Fenwick does not He opposes Federal financing of abortions she supports it He opposes enactment of a Federal guncontrol law she believes that a law similar to New Jerseys gunregistration law should be enacted nationwide Mr Bell also supports the death penalty Mrs Fenwick has opposed it in the past but says she could support a sharply limited use of capital punishment now Initially Mr Bell had hoped to wage the campaign almost exclusively on economic issues as he did four years ago when he upset Senator Clifford P Case in the primary before losing to Democrat Bill Bradley in the general election Mr Bell staunchly supports the Presidents budget and taxcutting program and the new federalism which Mr Bell says grew out of advice he and others gave thenGovernor Reagan of California in the mid1970s Federal Reserve Assailed He has argued that the high interest rates that are slowing economic activity in a number of areas have been caused by policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and he contends that the rates could be lowered to spur economic activity even in the presence of high Federal budget deficits Although this position separates him from the President Mr Bell has argued that Republicans interested in showing continued support for Mr Reagan should send him to Washington Mrs Fenwick has emphasized her support of much of Mr Reagans program to blunt possible perceptions that her victory could be construed as a vote against the Presidents policies She has argued that the Federal budget deficit has to be reduced before any real relief from the high interest rates can be expected Unlike Mr Bell Mrs Fenwick has said the defense budget will have to come in for its share of review before any further cuts in social programs are made She supports increasing military strength in conventional weapons but has opposed some of the more sophisticated weapons systems such as the MX and cruise missiles saying they have been discredited Mr Bell supports deployment of the MX missile and other new systems and would support an expanded military budget Both say they support a verifiable freeze on nuclear arms but Mr Bell warns against a freeze that would continue the advantage that Administration experts now believe the Soviet Union holds Both candidates have agreed that Mrs Fenwick held a lead of more than 2 to 1 when the race started and that Mr Bell has closed the gap in the final weeks of the campaign Mrs Fenwick has been able to capitalize on her record of never having lost an election  either for the New Jersey Legislature or for Congress  to pick up the lions share of endorsements from party officials interested in having a proven votegetter at the head of their slate of candidates for county offices in the fall election

ABOUT NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/nyregion/about-new-york.html,On a rainy Monday afternoon shortly before the evening rush was to begin in the Bowling Green IRT subway station in lower Manhattan the body of a newborn boy was discovered enclosed in two bags  one clear plastic the other brown paper  in a trash can on the mezzanine level The porter found the bag first The transit police officer opened it The token booth clerk came over to help The ambulance attendant declared the infant dead The police began an investigation The Medical Examiners office performed an autopsy The mother was unknown There are a great many compelling and awful things that happen in this city unnoticed unremarked Very few people knew or cared about this one but those who did cared very much indeed Some time has passed since that afternoon but for them memory is strong as a photograph The porter called me over said Officer Franklin Belle who has been on the transit police force 17 years and has two children He said he had just emptied the can and right after he emptied it somebody put this brown bag in it There was a plastic bag and I ripped it open and I saw the baby I felt for a heartbeat and a pulse and there was none The baby was cold That was one of the worst days of my life Ive had suicides before people run over by a train But a baby  a baby The baby looked peaceful as though it was sleeping It bothers me even now added Officer Belle who is on citywide patrol and has not been back to Bowling Green since that day It bothered everybody One of the porters knelt down and said a few prayers Officer Belle went into the token booth to call for an ambulance Annie Oliver who relieves other token booth clerks during their lunch breaks and then finishes up from 3 to 5 PM at the Bowling Green station had been on duty about 15 minutes I ran out because I thought the baby might still be alive said Mrs Oliver who has an adopted child But even after we knew it was dead we just couldnt leave it We started thinking all kinds of crazy things like maybe we should give it the last rites We just were all shook up Now sometimes when I think Ive forgotten it that baby comes back into my mind sudden Im not a prude she added I understand how these things happen I believe in abortion but to carry a baby for nine months and then do that  its unbelievable Anybody would have been proud to give birth to a baby like that  big wellformed She could have had that baby and left it in the bathroom somewhere Think of the people who want a child and cant have a child Ming Li an emergency medical technician at New York InfirmaryBeekman Downtown Hospital pronounced the baby dead at the scene I would have liked to do something he said But I couldnt All these things happened more than a month ago on April 26 but those people say they remember it like it was yesterday Mrs Oliver says when she gets to the Bowling Green station she always looks around her for something she is not sure what The baby has become an investigation of the New York City Police Department a file filled with pink and yellow and white official forms Dr Elliot Gross the citys Medical Examiner says the baby was 8 12 pounds full term an unattended birth He says its lungs were aerated which means it was not stillborn The baby has been declared a CUPPI  Cause of death Undetermined Pending Police Investigation So far that investigation has consisted primarily of a memo sent out soon after the discovery of the babys body To all detective commands A deceased newborn infant was found in the Bowling Green subway station opposite 2 Broadway Please make an inquiry of hospitals within your command for a female black or Hispanic who shows signs of having just given birth The inquiries revealed women in false labor women delivering prematurely women miscarrying but no woman who had just had a baby and could not explain where that baby had gone The only lead came in a call to Bayley Seton Hospital on Staten Island A detective there discovered that on the afternoon the baby was found at Bowling Green a woman called the hospital and said she had a friend who had just given birth to a dead baby She was advised to take her friend to St Vincents on Staten Island No such woman came into St Vincents The Bowling Green subway station is just north of the Staten Island ferry slip That is all It was not a major crime perhaps it was not a crime at all Sgt Donald Disken of the First Precinct says there are no real facts only hypotheses Perhaps a woman gave birth to a baby in one of the office towers around the subway station and it died and she panicked Perhaps she abandoned it living in the bag Maybe she did not even know what she was doing There were no stab wounds no gunshot wounds no blows to the head said the sergeant The only way well probably ever know what happened is if we find the mother The mother has not been heard from Sergeant Disken wonders if she might have been a teenager terrified of her parents reaction Officer Belle overwhelmed by what he saw suspects she must be deranged Mrs Oliver insists she saw her a big woman in heavy garments peeking around the subway entrance while the others were struggling over the babys body trying to bring it back to life She has no sympathy for the woman She cannot forget what a lovely baby it was The baby is scheduled to be buried this week in a grave dug by a Rikers Island work crew in potters field The location will be noted in case someone decides to claim the body later The case remains open

PRIMARIES' LESSON: ORGANIZATION AND MONEY REMAIN VALUABLE ASSETS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/10/us/primaries-lesson-organization-and-money-remain-valuable-assets-news-analysis.html,The busiest primary day of the spring appears to have turned out better for political parties than for any particular brand of political ideology and to have rewarded the often tedious political necessities of organization and money On Tuesday from Portland Me where Democrats nominated John Kerry a leader in the local antiabortion movement for the House of Representatives to California where Republicans uncharacteristically rejected their most conservative party hopefuls and chose their most formidable candidates to run in Novembers general election party leaders thought they were putting their ablest candidates forward The results from New Jersey to Montana appear to have been that rare sort of political occasion in which both Republicans and Democrats find a lot to be happy about and few painful surprises to make them rethink their approach Democrats from Frank R Lautenberg in New Jersey to Richard F Celeste in Ohio to Roxanne Conlin in Iowa won by stressing the recession But those victories did not amount to a rejection of President Reagans economic policies because the test in the primaries was just one of which Democrat could make the partys case most effectively Republicans Still Back Reagan Republicans from Millicent Fenwick in New Jersey to Pete Wilson in California won after presenting themselves as supporters of Mr Reagan But the success of their efforts proved only as opinion polls have already shown that Republicans are still behind their partys President not that Democrats and independents are too Aside from the everpresent economy no issues spun any clear threads through the 10 states in which candidates were nominated But two major primaries provided the occasion to show the potential of one issue that is plainly on politicians minds although not necessarily on the tips of their tongues The issue is the nuclear freeze which while not on the ballot nor a key part of any major contests in either Ohio or California appeared significant CBS News conducted polls of primary voters leaving the voting place in both states and found overwhelming approval for the freeze in each The margin was 64 percent to 25 percent in California and 71 percent to 20 percent in Ohio Despite Mr Reagans opposition to the freeze and his own popularity in his own state even California Republicans approved the concept 53 percent to 35 percent In Ohio Republicans backed the freeze 66 percent to 24 percent the CBS News Poll showed Economy Is a Real Issue But the nuclear freeze is a potential issue and the economy is a certain tangible one Here the CBS News polls dealt with expectations and offered Republicans tenuous encouragement By modest pluralities 41 percent to 29 percent in California and 35 percent to 30 percent in Ohio voters said they believed Mr Reagans economic policies would make things better by November Republicans cherished those hopes by margins of 10 to 1 Over the next five months agendas may change as nominees of both parties seek a wider appeal than to just the committed partisans who voted in their own primaries Some of the Republicans who tied themselves to Mr Reagan last week may be attacking him next month and if the economy turns up some of his critics in Democratic ranks may find other issues to emphasize In politics flexibility is a constant asset as the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr proved again yesterday He had spoken well of the courage of Representative Ronald M Mottl an Ohio Democrat who defected on key Reagan policy votes last year but nevertheless a Democrat After Mr Mottl was edged out in the primary by Edward Feighan a downtheline Democrat Mr ONeill saw a lesson for other Democrats out there He said it proved that one who supports Reagans economic cannot survive in a Democratic primary But other key values that showed up Tuesday are organization and an early start Organization helped Mr Kerry in Maine and Representative Clarence J Brown who won the right to oppose Mr Celeste for the governorship of Ohio depended on volunteers to outdistance one opponent more conservative than himself Thomas Van Meter and the more liberal entrant Seth Taft Early Start Helps In Iowa Mrs Conlin began early and lined up organizational support before her betterknown foes for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination got started In Arkansas former Gov Bill Clinton got off and running early and survived a late slump to win a runoff for renomination for his old job Another lesson that came through again in Tuesdays primaries as it has through most of the spring is that even with vigorously contested primaries this years Democrats are not killing themselves off California often a scene of bitter party fights had few intense contests among Democrats but many among Republicans As Ann F Lewis political director of the Democratic National Committee observed We didnt have a whole lot of races where Democrats spilled a lot of their own and other peoples blood The Democratic coalition seems to be getting together earlier this year than usual Republicans did not challenge that analysis but they too saw reason for encouragement If there was any trend yesterday said Nancy Sinnott executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee it was how often strong generalelection candidates won in the primaries
WOMAN IN THE NEWS; INDEPENDENT REPUBLICAN NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/10/nyregion/woman-in-the-news-independent-republican-nominee.html,It may have been a wonderful victory but she hardly paused long enough to let it take hold Barely 12 hours after Jeffrey Bell her opponent in New Jerseys Republican primary for the United States Senate conceded defeat Representative Millicent Fenwick was on her way back to Washington today to keep a busy schedule of meetings and subcommittee debates Not that she thought the campaign was merely an interlude or that she considered herself above the gritty tumble of politics  I loved it its a great game she said Tuesday night Rather the 72yearold fourterm Representative from Bernardsville likes to keep a high profile in Congress which is her way of telling her constituents that she is on the job Prefers the Public Approach to Politics Im not a political pro she said Ive never pretended to be one I think the district has been satisfied with a more public rather than a professional approach to politics Image  her ability to capture the attention of the public  has been Mrs Fenwicks greatest political asset Her campaign theme in a time of high unemployment was a predictable call for jobs but her real message to the Republican Party faithful was that her popularity and appeal were better Election Day capital than any issue or economic plan I dont know that I could say that each and every county chairman thinks Im adorable she said But I think they want somebody at the head of the ticket that has a likelihood of getting elected in November She is one of the most conspicuous presences in the House of Representatives a courtly woman with an earnest voice who leaves her admirers wideeyed and her antagonists sometimes disarmed She has developed a reputation for independence supporting such unRepublican causes as the equal rights amendment national gun control and Federal financing for abortions Her refusal to follow the party line  Im not a rubber stamp for anybody  prompted Walter Cronkite to call her the conscience of Congress Millicent Hammond Fenwick was born on Feb 25 1910 in New York City Her father Ogden Haggerty Hammond was a wealthy businessman who was elected twice in New Jersey to two terms in the House Her mother Mary Picton Stevens was a descendant of John Stevens for whom the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken is named Recalls Her Greatest Failure In 1934 she married Hugh Fenwick The couple had two children and were divorced in 1945 I consider the breakup of my marriage my greatest failure Mrs Fenwick once confided Indeed her constant message to other women seems to reflect her past I dont know of any job a woman can do that is more important than being a happy loved mother bringing up children she recently told the graduating class of Centenary College She has worked as a model for Harpers Bazaar and as a member of the writing staff of Vogue magazine In 1958 she was elected to the Bernardsville Borough Council and in 1970 she won a seat in the New Jersey Assembly In 1974 she was elected to her first term in Congress Her opponent in the primary that year a man she narrowly defeated went on to become the Governor of New Jersey Thomas H Kean Assets Put at 5 Million Her personal assets are estimated at 5 million but according to aides most of the money is tied up in trusts During the primary campaign she spent 140000 of her own funds and lent the campaign 186000 Her aides say that if she wants to use her personal resources in the general election she will have to borrow against the income from her trusts In most written accounts Mrs Fenwick is portrayed as an eccentric figure who smokes a pipe favors the prefix My dear and laces her speeches with eclectic quotes from the likes of Thomas Jefferson and William Butler Yeats This trend to report her style rather than her substance rankles her I hate politicians with gimmicks she said The press made such a fuss over my pipe I was going to give it up Then I decided Im not going to get bullied out of it By her own assessment she has two liabilities Im not as mild a person as I would like to be she said I do have a temper And at times she seems to be the victim of her own curiosity Has Wide Range of Interests You know she went on Ive never claimed to be an expert on things But Im interested in so many different areas that I sometimes seem to be hopping around She is a politician with mixed doctrines On economic and fiscal matters she voted with the Reagan Administration On social issues such as busing to achieve racial balance and abortion she sides with her more moderate colleagues Her Democratic opponent in the general election Frank R Lautenberg of Montclair will no doubt try to cast her as a loyal Republican in a state with a predominantly Democratic registration Mr Bell however her Republican opponent in the primary told voters she was a liberal Here from her recent book Speaking Up is what she says Good Democrats dont mind mandatory law regulations and ordinances Good Republicans ask Why Is the situation such that we must order people around like that A Republican speaks of Freedom to   a Democrat of Freedom from   Im a Republican
WILSON'S SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA G.O.P. PRIMARY REWRITES A POLITICAL OBITUARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/us/wilson-s-success-in-california-gop-primary-rewrites-a-political-obituary.html,Four years ago after Mayor Pete Wilson of San Diego spent 1 million and 18 months campaigning yet finished fourth in a fiveman race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination a political columnist for The San Diego Union wrote an article concluding that it was doubtful Mr Wilson has a bright future as a statewide candidate After his substantial victory Tuesday in the Republican primary for the United States Senate in which he became his partys candidate to derail the political ambitions of Gov Edmund G Brown Jrs bid for that post it was likely that Mr Wilson remembered this and other obituaries for his political ambitions The 48yearold Mayor of Californias second largest city after trailing in opinion surveys for almost a year won the Senate nomination from six opponents with 38 percent of the vote He received only 9 percent of the vote in the 1978 gubernatorial primary Contributions to Victory After the election Republican activists and other analysts are saying that Mr Wilson changed his political fortunes because of five factors These were the failure of Representative Barry M Goldwater Jr to protect a strong lead in the race virtually nonstop campaigning by Mr Wilson since 1978 to tell voters outside San Diego of his accomplishments there extensive television advertising especially early in the campaign that increased the extent to which voters in northern California were aware of him an effort to change his image from moderate to conservative which helped him raise funds from party contributors for more television advertising and a modest change in his campaign style which some critics in 1978 called bland and plastic This year Mr Wilson used a more relaxed technique that included more jokes but still conveyed a kind of mature reserve and selfconfidence Some of his critics including Representative Paul N McCloskey Jr who ran second with 25 percent of the vote said that Mr Wilson had profited from a practice late in the campaign of avoiding stands on issues likely to offend special interest groups Mr Wilson has had a reputation for being forthright and open on controversial matters But in the closing days of the campaign Mr McCloskey a moderate who had competed for months with Mr Wilson for contributions from business interests repeatedly used such terms as mush and pablum in describing Mr Wilsons answers at debates He also accused Mr Wilson of attempting to curry favor with Jewish contributors by not being blunt in criticizing Israeli actions Lack of Statewide Awareness Whatever the reasons for his victory Mr Wilson unquestionably appeared to have emerged from what he has referred to for years as the San Diego media culdesac He was referring to a belief that newspapers and broadcasters elsewhere in the state tend to pay little attention to San Diego which is situated at the southern end of California Mr Wilson a Yaleeducated lawyer with youthful looks and a conservative style of dress was elected Mayor in 1971 after serving six years in the State Assembly As Mayor he won approval of campaign finance reforms to clean up corrupt practices He worked to consolidate power in the Mayors office and went on to earn a reputation for running an efficient municipal government His fiscal record was achieved long before Californians frustrations over government spending exploded in the Proposition 13 restrictions on property taxes adopted in 1978 Foe of Urban Sprawl Not all of his efforts succeeded One of his favorite goals to revitalize downtown San Diego with a new convention center was not achieved But Mr Wilson who was reelected twice became an aggressive foe of what he called Los Angelization or the unbounded urban sprawl for which Los Angeles is famous and pushed through ordinances that placed zoning restrictions on residential growth that despite population growth limited the kind of sprawl typical of fastgrowing Sunbelt cities In 1976 Mr Wilson campaigned for President Ford a step that angered supporters of Ronald Reagan This coupled with his disputes with developers over means of limiting growth and his endorsement of taxpaid abortions for the indigent gave him a reputation as a moderate Although some California conservatives still regard him as too liberal in the primary campaign he embraced conservative though not farright positions on issues of national defense crime and economic policy He supporte Reagan Administration policies but contended that the President was accepting excessive Federal deficits Gamble on TV Advertising He also spent more than 200000 in March in a gamble on television advertising intended to increase voter recognition of his name the commercials recounted his record in San Diego and depicted him as the candidate who can beat Jerry Brown His standing in the polls rose attracting more financial support from agricultural and business interests who had been unhappy with Mr Brown This allowed him to spent more on advertising In the primary Mr Wilson seemed to have won over some conservative voters who according to the results of earlier polls seemed committed to Mr Goldwater But Mr Goldwater faded fast in the weeks before the election he finished with 18 percent of the vote Mr McCloskey while doing well in the northern part of the state did poorly in the south Mr Wilson who makes no attempt to conceal a contempt for Mr Brown that seems to go beyond normal partisanship told reporters today that he would attack Mr Brown on the basis of his record as Governor Meanwhile Mr Brown who won the Democratic nomination for the Senate against token opposition has indicated that he will campaign against Mr Wilson on two grounds He plans to argue that the Reagan Administrations economic policies have failed and that its military policies could lead the world into nuclear war Mr Brown has asked for a series of debates to begin soon Mr Wilson has said that he wants to debate but only later in the summer
SURVEY FINDS SEMINARY PROFESSORS MORE MORALLY CONSERVATIVE THAN PUBLIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/us/survey-finds-seminary-professors-more-morally-conservative-than-public.html,Roman Catholic and Protestant seminary professors are more conservative on religious and moral concerns than the general public but more liberal on certain political issues according to a recent survey conducted by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut The study which examined questionnaires from 1112 professors at Protestant and Roman Catholic seminaries was undertaken on behalf of the Institute for Educational Affairs in New York an agency that provides grants for educational research While the theology professors responding to the survey generally agreed with one another on major doctrinal matters and on questions relating to personal morality they expressed differences on a number of political issues a result that seemed to confirm the view that on many matters of public concern there is no clearcut Christian position espoused by believers Expressing orthodox Christian theologies the professors in the survey agreed on the divinity of Jesus the authority but not the inerrancy of the Bible and the need to convert others to Christianity Responses on these and related issues along with their own perception of their views indicated that those preparing the nations future priests and ministers were religiously conservative or moderate in their views Conservative Moral Views On matters of sexual ethics and personal morality the theologians are probably more conservative than the general public the survey disclosed They have strong feelings about the immorality of homosexuality and sexual relations outside marriage Most feel that abortion is immoral But the survey also disclosed a reluctance to enact laws enforcing their views of immorality For instance twothirds said that homosexual acts were immoral but only 25 percent said homosexual acts should be against the law Seventy percent of those responding said abortion was immoral but only 44 percent felt it should be against the law Politically the theology professors who responded are more liberal than the general public both in their characterizations of themselves and in their views on specific issues A majority of them voted for liberal candidates in the last three Presidential elections They seemed to share the same liberal political views as those held by other academicians More Episcopal professors 78 percent rated themselves liberal than did teachers from other denominations the survey disclosed Professors from other denominations rating themselves liberal were Methodist 69 percent Presbyterian 63 percent Catholic 60 percent American Baptist 54 percent United Church of Christ 53 percent and Lutheran 52 percent About 25 percent of those answering the survey said they considered themselves politically conservative Most Lean Toward Democrats Sixty percent of those responding said they were Democrats or leaned toward the Democratic Party Thirtysix percent believe a Christian can be a Marxist Both Democratic socialism and laissezfaire capitalism were appropriate political systems for Christians to espouse a large majority of the respondents said Most of the professors believe the Government is not spending enough to preserve the environment provide adequate health care or solve urban problems Twothirds favor the passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment On foreign affairs 70 percent think the United States treats the third world unfairly Fiftyseven percent feel the United States is a force for good in the world and 18 percent feel that the United States is a force for ill in the world Views On Nuclear Weapons Most were also critical of the operations of United States companies abroad although the survey did not ask those responding to be more specific in their criticisms of American business Repressive regimes aligned with the United States and Communist expansion were equal problems in the world the professors said Teachers from conservative churches such as the Baptists and Pentecostal denominations tended to have a more favorable view of the role the United States plays in world affairs Questioned on their attitudes toward nuclear war 46 percent of those responding said the use of nuclear weapons was always morally wrong Sixty percent of the Roman Catholic theologians responding said using nuclear weapons was always wrong Fiftythree percent of the respondents said the morality of nuclear weapons depended upon the circumstances of the war Military Buildup Is Criticized President Reagans increased emphasis on military preparedness was criticized by threequarters of the professors Only 7 percent said the United States spent too little on its defenses Most of the professors polled said they agreed with the positions taken by their respective churches on political issues But on two issues the Roman Catholic seminary teachers clearly departed from the official stand of their church For instance 75 percent of all those polled including the Roman Catholic professors support ordination for women Almost half the Roman Catholic professors believe that remarriage for divorced persons is morally neutral There was nothing in the survey to indicate in what ways the theological professors were politically active but when questioned about the activities of Moral Majority the conservative lobbying group 77 percent said they opposed its activities and nearly that many said Moral Majority hurts the cause of religion in this country

HATCH DISOWNS GROUP'S ADS ATTACKING MAYOR OF SALT LAKE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/us/hatch-disowns-group-s-ads-attacking-mayor-of-salt-lake.html,A national political action committee based in Virginia has committed 80000 to an advertising campaign against Mayor Ted Wilson of Salt Lake City a Democrat who is seeking the Senate seat held by Senator Orrin G Hatch Mr Hatch a conservative Republican has resisted that committees support The advertising drive which is to begin Tuesday is aimed at attacking the idea that Mr Wilson is a moderatetoconservative Democrat He will be portrayed in the advertising as a freespending liberal who associated with socalled ultraliberals and as an enemy of President Reagan Those familiar with the matter here say the campaign will probably skirt abortion which Mr Wilson opposes in most cases Hatch Left Committee Senator Hatch a former member of ProLifes advisory committee resigned last year He asked the group and others to support him through authorized campaign committee channels We have a strong disagreement with their tactics said Michael Leavitt the Senators campaign manager We wish they would take their distasteful act back to Virginia Negative political advertising is rare in Utah Peter B Gemma Jr the ProLife committees executive director said in an interview at his groups temporary headquarters in the Hotel Utah here this week that the committee considered the Senate race in Utah the nations most important in this years election His group will also conduct a campaign for the reelection of Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin Democrat who is regarded as likely to vote in accordance with the ProLife groups stands Its not a battle of right and wrong ideas Mr Gemma said of Senator Hatchs objections to his committees support Its a battle of good ideas A lot of people think this kind of negative campaign is very important while other people think it wont work but the history of it is that every negative independent expenditure that has ever been run has worked and none has backfired In 1980 Mr Gemmas organization distributed leaflets in Boise Idaho calling Senator Frank Church Democrat of Idaho a baby killer Mr Church lost the election to Representative Steven D Symms a Republican The same year Mr Gemma directed a negative advertising drive against Senator George McGovern in South Dakota Nothing to Do With Them Ive asked the PAC to stay out said Senator Hatch producing a copy of a letter to Mr Gemma dated May 27 that said as much I cant do any more I have nothing to do with them anymore and Im not going to dwell on this stuff Senator Hatch sponsored a proposed Federal amendment to the Constitution that would restore to states the authority to legislate on abortions Two weeks ago downtown telephone poles in Salt Lake City were covered with unsigned wanted posters bearing Senator Hatchs image Mr Gemmas campaign was to have begun here this week but an advertisement he sought to place in The Salt Lake Tribune and in The Deseret News was rejected by the publishers because they said the individuals depicted in it had not signed releases It was a drawing depicting Mr Wilson at a cocktail party with Robert Redford the actor and Senators Alan Cranston and Edward M Kennedy With the exception of Mr Wilson a Mormon who does not drink alcohol each had a drink in his hand The caption referred to a Wilson fundraising party in May and concluded Cmon Ted with all those antiReagan leftwingers back East raising money for you who do you think youre fooling It is precisely this kind of antagonism that divides the country Mr Redford said at Sundance Resort his home 45 miles southeast of here Political writers had mentioned him as a possible challenger to Senator Hatch in 1982 but he rejected the idea Maybe this is Senator Hatchs idea of a joke said Mr Redford who is a close friend of Mr Wilson adding But then again Ive always said he didnt have a sense of humor They Are Not True Messages Mr Wilson said I guess its going to cost 80000 to sell those messages because they are not true messages if a message is that I am soft on abortion He said he opposed abortion except when the mothers life was in danger or in cases of rape or incest Senator Hatch the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is largely opposed by labor which Mr Wilson is courting Mayor Wilson has been gaining in polls but still trails Mr Hatch by percentage five points according to a Wilson tally in a Hatchsponsored poll he trails the Senator by 12 points Mr Hatch has a 6to1 lead in fundraising with 12 million as against 200000 for the challenger
CAN SCIENCE AND POLITICS SAFELY MIX,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/weekinreview/can-science-and-politics-safely-mix.html,Remember Allen V Astin He became the Eisenhower Administrations first big bombshell back in 1953 As director of the National Bureau of Standards Dr Astin ran afoul of the political leadership because his agency which jealously guarded its reputation as a scientific bastion impregnable to political and commercial pressures  had declared a chemical called ADX2 then sold as a rejuvenator of tired car batteries useless The products promoter however was a friend of Dr Astins boss Sinclair Weeks the Secretary of Commerce who promptly fired the Bureau of Standards director The result was a storm of protest from the scientific community Mr Weekss recanting and Dr Astins rehiring ADX2 was not heard from again As that incident suggests science cannot always be separated from politics And as recent events indicate the fallout is not always so humorous Last month for example Science the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science disclosed that the Department of Agriculture was using a political litmus test in appointing its peer review panels which judge the quality of basic research proposals Department officials said that in choosing among scientists with comparable professional credentials preference was given to those philosophically compatible with the Reagan Administration In the publicity that followed Secretary John R Block reversed the policy The Washington Post last week reported that political referrals were being used to fill vacancies in the Food and Drug Administrations advisory panels of experts Aides to Health and Human Services Secretary Richard S Schweiker said they were trying to broaden panel membership Meanwhile the National Academy of Sciences has been frozen out of Governmentsupported research on acid rain with the Administration suggesting that academy studies are biased and the academys friends hinting the Administration might be unhappy with the scientific truth about a politically volatile subject In other matters the Reagan Administration appears to have respected the independence and integrity of science It appears not to have interfered for example with the two largest Federal science agencies the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health The institutes new director Dr James Wyngaarden is a respected professional nominally a Democrat and has expressed views on abortion inconsistent with the Administrations So it remains to be seen whether a consistent pattern is emerging Reaction in the scientific community however is clear There is widespread unease With each political era we find examples where the sensitivity of the scientific system is tested by abuses said Dr Donald Fredrickson who served under three Presidents and five department secretaries as director of the National Institutes of Health There is always someone who exerts more zeal than is justified in appointments Political people come in not understanding scientific method They must learn Dr Fredrickson does not perceive an organized effort to subvert the integrity of science Neither does William D Carey executive director of the AAAS But Mr Carey does argue that Government departments need more guidance from the White House science adviser to prevent spread of the infection of political interference There seems little hope in that direction When asked about the problem the science adviser Dr George A Keyworth 2d said it was eminently reasonable for the President to want scientific panels that share his political philosophy There are not very many panels that look at issues that are 100 percent scientific and technological Dr Keyworth said citing birth control abortion industrial innovation agriculture and arms control What is wanted he said are competent scientists who understand what President Reagan perceives as the role of government If a panel is to evaluate basic research proposals he said no political considerations should enter But according to Dr Keyworth when it comes to evaluating say birth control research antiabortion activists should be considered Asked if a political loyalties test would be used in replacing Dr John Slaughter who announced that he would leave this summer as director of the National Science Foundation Dr Keyworth said a scientist of excellence would be chosen but ultimately we will choose a person whose philosophy is compatible with the President Clearly there are posts in government where science and medicine merge into policy and politics particularly in regulatory agencies While many may disagree for example with the strong views of Surgeon General CEverett Koop on family life and abortion  hes profamily and antiabortion  few would disagree that the President has the right to appoint a doctor who shares his views on such matters particularly since the Surgeon General has little to do with research He is mainly the Governments spokesman on health What worries scientists is political intrusion into decisions on what constitutes good and bad science and on which projects should be funded Traditionally these choices have been guided by nonpartisan panels of working scientists from outside government Even politically conservative scientists such as Herbert I Fusfeld a physicist and head of New York Universitys Center for Science and Technology Policy are worried Its plain stupid to use political criteria in staffing these groups Dr Fusfeld said From time to time and for certain purposes a government representative uses nontechnical criteria But in almost every case they distort the purpose of the panel and they mess up the program

SOMETIMES WASHINGTON CLAIMS TO KNOW BEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/weekinreview/sometimes-washington-claims-to-know-best.html,Ronald Reagan ran for the Presidency promising to get Government off the backs of the people and in many ways he has been true to his word He has tried to reduce the burden of Federal regulations and the role of Federal agencies in private industry and in private lives But on several questions of importance to the Administration including social issues with moral overtones Mr Reagan has not hesitated to assert Federal authority at the expense of local or individual prerogatives Every President in modern times has done this the supremacy clause of the Constitution makes clear that the Founding Fathers intended Federal law to take precedence over local law where they conflict Still some critics noting that Mr Reagan has long urged Federal officials to defer to the superior wisdom of local officials say they are surprised by his attempts to expand Washingtons role The latest such effort came last week when Social Security officials said they wanted access to tax records of more than 4 million welfare recipients The agency wants the information to verify eligibility and said that it would end payments for individuals who did not give their consent The request follows a proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services to require that parents be notified whenever children under the age of 18 received oral contraceptives or prescription birthcontrol devices from federally funded family planning clinics Another attempt to impose Washingtons will may come from some Administration officials who would like to cut housing funds for cities that continue to enforce local rent control laws Such a penalty would directly affect New York City where more than 12 million apartments are under rent control or rent stabilization The Quarrel With Quotas In civil rights the President has criticized a voluntary affirmative action program approved by the United States Supreme Court in which a large aluminum company set aside half the openings in a training program for black employees The Administration is looking for an appropriate case to challenge the use of numerical hiring goals which it opposes even when adopted voluntarily The Administration has also asked the Supreme Court to end a desegregation program adopted by local school boards in Seattle and Tacoma Wash The Justice Department staunchly opposed to the use of busing for desegregation urged the Court to uphold a state antibusing law Some of these efforts offend libertarian conservatives as well as liberals Dan M Burt president of the Capital Legal Foundation a conservative nonprofit organization said that the effort to obtain tax data for welfare recipients was outrageous because the privacy of such information should be considered sacrosanct Mr Burt also criticized the contraception proposal saying that the state should not be in the position of being an informer Representative James H Scheuer of Brooklyn a liberal Democrat denounced it as an example of Big Brother government at its worst This Administration talks endlessly about getting government off peoples backs Mr Scheuer said but what they really seem to intend is to get government into peoples bedrooms and under their beds For every such initiative the Reagan Administration has a rationale Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services describes the contraception proposal as an effort to encourage communication between parents and children The family he said should be the focal point for dealing with problems of sexual activity and pregnancy among teenagers The Presidents advisers say they oppose rent control because it discourages landlords and lenders from investing in rental housing Therefore they say local rent control laws deter the production and maintenance of housing There seems to be no clear pattern to the Federal intervention thus far but analysts suggest several reasons for it In some cases the Administration sees a moral or social issue of such importance that it justifies Federal involvement President Reagan has supported stringent restrictions on abortion for example and he wants Congress to amend the Constitution to permit prayer in public schools In some areas a political constituency supports Federal intervention and like any official Mr Reagan wants to use his power to address the concerns of those who elected him The Paperwork Problem The Administration justifies some new Federal regulations as an effort to reduce waste and fraud in Government programs such as welfare and food stamps Recipients face more paperwork because they must report each month on their income and resources but Administration officials say such requirements help insure that Federal aid goes only to people who need it In areas such as immigration and national security officials say President Reagan proposed a larger Federal role in response to serious problems Expressing deep concerns about the influx of illegal aliens he has asked Congress to enact a law requiring all job applicants citizens as well as aliens to show identification papers to prospective employers The Chamber of Commerce of the United States objects to the proposal as a further intrusion by Government into the work place Mr Reagan also issued an executive order broadening the authority of the nations intelligence agencies to collect information from Americans at home and abroad including people not suspected of any crime The order gives the Central Intelligence Agency authority to conduct covert operations approved by the President within the United States A prior order issued by President Carter prohibited such domestic activities Mr Reagan said the change would protect the nation from espionage and terrorism and fulfill his campaign promise to revitalize the intelligence system
ADOPTION: SHOULD RECORDS BE OPENED?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/nyregion/adoption-should-records-be-opened.html,Adoption is at least as old as the Bible Moses the worlds most famous adoptee was placed by his mother in a spot where Pharoahs daughter would be sure to find and take him in For thousands of years adoption remained almost that informal someone would take in and rear a friends relatives or strangers baby Only in the 19th century was adoption formalized in this country with the first statutes going on the books in Massachusetts in 1855 Half a century later because of the stigma of illegitimacy states began sealing birth and agency and court adoption records to protect the adoptive parents the biological parents and the adopted child Today much of the social stigma of illegitimacy and unmarried pregnancy has vanished and the need for confidentiality is being seen by some people as a barrier not a protection Unmarried teenage girls who in the 1950s and 60s probably would have chosen adoption and secrecy about a birth rarely do so today According to a 1981 report by the Alan Guttmacher Institute of New York which does research on policy analysis and public education 90 percent of unmarried white teenage mothers and nearly all black mothers keep their babies This together with the legalization of abortion has been changing the nature of adoption Where 20 years ago adoption agencies scrambled to find homes for healthy infants couples now often have a fiveyear wait to adopt a baby through an agency In the last decade controversy often emotional and highly charged about opening adoption records has been growing all over the country At issue are  Should the records be opened  If so for whom  At what age should access be granted  How open should records be A bill to open adoption records is now before the State Legislature with not all those issues decided Leading the drive to give adult adoptees access to records  there are about 5 million adoptees in the United States  is ALMA the Adoptees Liberty Movement Association The organization founded in 1971 by Florence Fisher of New York City has 50 chapters and about 50000 members It maintains a national registry of 340000 searching adult adoptees birth mothers and fathers siblings aunts uncles grandparents and others hoping to find family members According to Miss Fisher adult adoptees must have primacy of rights to override the wishes of birth parents or adoptive parents for confidentiality because the adoptee had nothing to do with the contract entered into by both sets of parents Sealed records keep an adoptive person buried alive for his or her whole life Miss Fisher said The outrage is that we must respect the rights of the adoptive parents and the birth parents What about the rights of the adult adoptee being conditional on the whims of other people On the other hand William Pierce president of the Washingtonbased National Committee for Adoption which has 100 member agencies throughout the country argues that the issue of open records is largely a  squeaky wheel syndrome  a lot of noise from a little tiny minority Most birth parents and adult adoptees he says have made new lives for themselves and do not want to confront the past on their doorstep some day In 1977 ALMA filed suit in New York City to open the records of adult adoptees The case ALMA v Mellon the citys Registrar of Vital Statistics was dismissed and an appeal to the United States District Court of Appeals was lost A similar ALMA suit filed in 1981 is now pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court Adoption is regulated by the states There is no overall Federal legislation although the Federal Model Adoption Act of 1980 gives guidelines and standards for adoption procedures The Federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 gives adopted American Indians upon reaching majority the unconditional right to petition the court for information on their birth origins so that they can substantiate tribal membership Nearly all states except Kansas Alabama and South Dakota have laws saying that adoption records must be sealed although there are variations In Pennsylvania for example an adult adoptee can obtain an original birth certificate but not the court or agency records of the adoption in Minnesota an adult adoptee can have access to his or her records with permission of the natural parents in Idaho records may be opened upon the petition of the person adopted New Jersey sealed its adoption records in two parts  birth certificates in 1935 and court records in 1938  but in 1977 in Mills v the Atlantic City Department of Vital Statistics the door was opened slightly by Superior Court Judge Philip Gruccio According to The New Jersey Law Journal he ruled that the burden of proof should shift to the state to demonstrate good cause why an adult adoptee should not examine his own birth records In establishing guidelines Judge Gruccio said that if the consent of the birth parents was on file access to records by adult adoptees should be automatic if it was not he ruled the agency that handled the adoption should contact the birth parent Because of this decision the states Division of Youth and Family Services has developed a registry in which it tries to locate birth parents for adult adoptees with the birth parents consent It also allows birth parents who have placed a child for adoption through the division to keep their name and current address on file should their adult children choose to contact them However Lee Campbell of Dover NH founder of Concerned United Birthparents a 2200member national organization that was formed in 1976 contends that not many birth parents would search for their children through an agency By their very nature agencies are forbidding kinds of bureaucratic institutions Mrs Campbell said Birth parents are terrified of agencies These were once the omnipotent people who took their children and told them to forget about the experience And Mary Lou Sweeney of the Division of Youth and Family Services says that many birth mothers do not want to be found An increasing number of adoptees are coming back for information she said but we have contacted a significant number of birth mothers on behalf of adult adoptees who have a husband they havent told In the past if an adult adoptee wanted information about his or her parents it was taken as a sign of being unhappy in the adoptive family However according to a study made in 1976 by Dr William F Reynolds Diane Chiappise and Mary Walsh of Queens College in New York and Dr Mark F Eisnitz of the Division of Adolescent Medicine Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles there is little evidence that the search is a symptom of dissatisfaction and disaffection with his adoptive family relationships According to Dr Zellig Bach of Lakehurst a psychologist All want to know but some do not seek Dr Bach who has treated a number of adopted children with serious academic difficulties believes that uncertainties about ones origins can cause problems in learning Because adopted children couldnt answer the question Who am I all other learning had no meaning for them he said One reason often given by adult adoptees seeking access to their records is that they want medical and genetic information In the past however agencies did not routinely collect these data from the birth parents Often the only people with this information are the birth parents Access to the records  or the birth parents  for medical information has been deemed good cause and permitted by some courts while being denied by others There is also a reason not often talked about one with origins in the Oedipus legend ALMAs lawyer Cyril Means Jr a professor at New York Law School cites this modernday echo of the ancient Greek tragedy In San Diego in the 60s a 17yearold sailor married his 34yearold mother who had given him up for adoption in Los Angeles County at birth She had neglected to divorce her last husband who reported both of them to the County Prosecutor for bigamy The prosecutor discovering that the boy was adopted went to Los Angeles County to get access to the sealed records and discovered to his horror that the boy had married his own mother  And Professor Means adds This undoubtedly happens many many many times without its being discovered  Next The fight to

EXISTENTIAL SAINT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/books/existential-saint.html,DOROTHY DAY A Biography By William D Miller Illustrated 527 pp New York Harper  Row 1895 Many years ago I was talking to William F Buckley Jr  whose private persona is as liberal as his public positions are conservative  about Dorothy Day In a strained attempt at wit I told him When the history of the Catholic Church in America in the 20th century is written Francis Cardinal Spellman will be a footnote and Dorothy Day a chapter That supercilious comment I now suspect was quite accurate Dorothy Day was a saint which means among many other things that she was utterly human complex inconsistent And yet there was a serene core in her tumultuous life In the half century between her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1927 and her death in 1980 she sought to see Christ in everyone in Bowery derelicts and in Nazis in Communists and in cardinals who admired Senator Joseph McCarthy Everyone on that contradictory list which is far from complete probably detested everyone else on the list and all of them would have resented being the object of such an indiscriminate love Logically Dorothy Days attitude was and is absurd a fact which she would recognize joyously We are she liked to say fools for Christ William Millers new biography meticulously documents a fascinating life It has one possible weakness On a number of troublesome issues  Dorothy Days pacifism during World War II her traditionalism in matters of religious faith which was as marked as her radicalism in politics  he provides all the facts but very little interpretation And since Dorothy Day was the very antithesis of the plasterofparis saint so utterly individualistic and contradictory in her holiness one wishes that there were more speculation in this biography But the volume Mr Miller has written is indispensable it will provide a solid basis for all the interpretations to come We are particularly indebted to him for his reconstruction of her early years prior to her conversion to Catholicism at the age of 30 She was a radical and a feminist her first arrest was in a suffrage demonstration in 1917 a reporter on the Socialist Call in New York City who wrote humaninterest stories rather than ideology a staff member of the quintessential leftist magazine The Masses In her bohemian world opposition to capitalist politics mingled with hostility to bourgeois morality and culture She was close to both Eugene ONeill the playwright and Mike Gold the revolutionary In later years after she had been living with alcoholics from the Bowery in the Catholic Worker House and editing the paper the Catholic Worker Dorothy Day tended to pretty up her youth downplaying the drinking in particular There was endless speculation about her relationship with ONeill when I was living at the Worker House in the early 50s He had taught her Francis Thompsons poem The Hound of Heaven in a Greenwich Village speakeasy and we all wondered how romantic her involvement with him had been Mr Miller comes up with a clear answer They were extremely close but ultimately their relationship was platonic She was however involved with others in serious love affairs one of which led to an abortion when she was 22 In the 1920s before she became a Catholic she lived in a commonlaw marriage with Forster Batterham she met him through the Malcolm Cowleys his sister married Kenneth Burke and had a daughter Tamar THIS was hardly the background that produced Catholics in those days How did the young woman who had worked for the AntiImperialist League building support for General Sandinos movement in Nicaragua  and who had even done a stint as a studio writer in Hollywood  join the Church of Rome It was one can be sure an existential rather than a theological decision She came to it in the period before and after the birth of her daughter when she was living on Staten Island Then and throughout her life Dorothy Day responded to the specific the tactile the personal Those critics who thought she was a Quaker infiltrating the Catholic Church never understood that She was to the very center of her being sacramental her faith was expressed in bread and wine and water and her conversion took place in terms of symbols not arguments In the early 30s she met Peter Maurin A selfeducated man sometimes eccentric sometimes brilliant and almost always aphoristic Maurin was a descendant of a French radical tradition that combined modern socialist and medieval values a kind of anticapitalism that idealized peasants rather than workers That tradition coincided in part with Dorothy Days own vision of a society of decentralized facetoface communes and it provided the basis for their collaboration in research and teaching and in the Catholic Worker movement until Maurins death in 1949 She however had the virtue of inconsistency he did not As Mr Miller notes Maurin inveighed against the wage system root and branch but Dorothy Day threw herself into the struggle for unionism and higher wages In a matter of six or seven years in the 30s her utopian vision inspired practical activities that had a major impact on American Catholicism The Catholic tradeunion movement and the interracial peace and liturgical movements all owed her a major debt The core of The Catholic Worker then and now was a commitment to the corporal works of mercy like feeding and clothing and sheltering the poor in houses of hospitality around the country Those who joined the movement  it would have been treason and inexact to call it an organization  lived with the walking wounded who came in from the streets sharing rooms and food and clothes with them The utopian discussions about anarchism and nonviolence thus took place in a depressingly real world that was sometimes squalid In the 30s when Dorothy Day began this work these centers were the oases of lay Catholicism in the United States THEN came World War II and suddenly Dorothy Days influence receded as she remained committed to an absolute pacifism and refused to support the United States even in a struggle against a fascism she detested Mr Miller rightly calls her stand one of the significant events in contemporary religious history but he does not really explore its meaning Pacifism at that time was to my mind politically irrelevant and most of the Catholic Worker activists in fact abandoned it But  and this is crucial  her pacifism was not the act of a politician but of a prophet it was intended as witness to a transcendental truth about the unity of humankind and the fact that no politics could be based upon it did not bother her Most people did not appreciate fools for Christ at that point in our history and the Catholic Worker movement went into decline When I first encountered it in 1951 it was a remnant of its former self opposing the Korean War fighting the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg helping organize picket lines against Francos Spain It was at that point that one of Dorothy Days most complex qualities came to the fore An anarchistpacifist opponent of holy mother the state she was a theologically orthodox quite obedient daughter of holy mother the church Indeed to the very end of her life she defended Romes traditional teaching on divorce birth control and abortion In the 50s this posed a great problem for ecclesiastical authorities who were among the most enthusiastic of cold warriors What does one do with a leftwing saint who argues for civilly disobedient resistance to the draft and simultaneously and sincerely says that if ordered by the cardinal she would close down the Catholic Worker In the late 50s there came another turning point in Dorothy Days life and this time her pacifism took on enormous relevance The change began with the airraidshelter madness of the times when New York City and other places decreed that citizens must practice how to avoid holocaust in the case of nuclear attack For five years Dorothy Day and the Catholic Workers refused to take cover and they were arrested and jailed By now the lonely times were over The Catholic left that had been miniscule in the 50s revived within the antiwar and civilrights movements of the 60s But even then there was no simple happy ending The 60s movements were countercultural and Dorothy Day was not The woman who had fled to the coasts of Bohemia when they were the province of a happy few was upset now that the old irreverence had become the style of masses of the young Was this nothing more than inevitable conservatizing process that the cynical established wisdom tells us always accompanies maturity That is too simple by far In August 1973 at the age of 76 Dorothy Day was arrested in California as she demonstrated in support of Cesar Chavezs United Farm Workers More than half a century after her first youthful act of civil disobedience she was still a militant radical And now it may even be that the lonely pacifist witness of the earlier years is having a growing impact upon the Catholic Church The bishops are debating issues of pacifism and the morality of war that she defined long ago with what appeared to be lack of success Indeed in one of the most striking politicaltheological changes ever the American hierarchy is probably now somewhat closer to Dorothy Days point of view than to the patriotic orthodoxy that prevailed at the time of Cardinal Francis Spellman William Miller has brilliantly set the stage for an understanding of this transformation by writing an excellent factual life of a woman who had a major impact upon American Catholicism Her funeral was a fitting end to her life as Mr Miller understands The Cardinal Archbishop of New York came and with very real tact shook hands with mourners but did not intrude upon a mass in which princes of the church were irrelevant It was supposed to be a private service but more than 500 people came and when the priest asked that only the family follow the plain wooden box of a coffin 300 lined up behind it None of the important people there like Cesar Chavez and IF Stone were assigned seats and the recessional for this woman who will probably be declared a Catholic saint was A Mighty Fortress is Our God Martin Luthers great hymn the Marseillaise of the Protestant Reformation Dorothy Days chapter in the Catholic Church is I suspect far from over William Millers book is an excellent introduction to it
PRO-ABORTION GROUP SETS A MAJOR POLITICAL DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/14/style/pro-abortion-group-sets-a-major-political-drive.html,After years of watching their opponents cast terror into the hearts of politicians the advocates of legal abortion are planning their own allout political drive this year Some 300 delegates gathered this weekend at Washingtons Hyatt Regency Hotel near Capitol Hill to practice their skills at a mock political convention and hear leaders of the National Abortion Rights Action League the selfdescribed political arm of the prochoice movement lay plans for the most aggressive campaign in the organizations 13year history Like the feminist National Organization for Women and numerous environmental groups Naral has enjoyed a tremendous surge in membership and contributions since the inauguration of President Reagan The lobbying groups membership has grown to about 140000 up from 90000 in November 1980 and NaralPAC the organizations political action committee has already raised 400000 of a hopedfor 750000 to 1 million for the 1982 campaign In contrast the organization raised only 400000 in the previous two years A Political Advantage The perception among politicians has been that you didnt get a lot out of being prochoice said Nanette Falkenberg Narals 30yearold executive director We want those on our side to know that being prochoice can be a political advantage We have to provide a counterweight to those pickets This was a reference to the antiabortion movements habit of picketing prochoice gatherings politicians and abortion clinics Miss Falkenberg who was named to her job last February after acquiring a reputation as a successful political organizer for the onemillionmember American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees admitted that Naral had learned from the failure of supporters of the proposed equal rights amendment to build strong state organizations Naral is putting primary emphasis on building a strong grassroots political mechanism in 17 key states The idea behind this essentially defensive strategy is that if a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is ever passed by Congress prochoice forces on the state level will already be organized to defeat it This year NaralPAC and affiliated state PACs are providing money and volunteers to candidates for seven state legislatures and in at least one case provided a candidate with his chief political strategist and virtually all of his volunteers According to Miss Falkenberg most of Narals roughly 35 state affiliates can mobilize from 500 to 1000 volunteers On the national level Naral is getting involved in as many as twothirds of the 1982 races for the Senate where debate on the abortion issue is scheduled to take place this summer The group has already made 5000 contributions to Senators Daniel P Moynihan Democrat of New York and Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut and Representatives Don Edwards Democrat of California and Barney Frank Democrat of Massachusetts Other likely recipients will be Jerry Brown Democrat of California and Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio Six Candidates Targeted In contrast to Narals broad support for friendly legislators the leading antiabortion political organization the Life Amendment Political Action Committee or Lapac is concentrating all of its vast resources on defeating only six prochoice candidates for the Senate Lapac plans to spend up to 1 million in 1982 roughly twice what it spent in 1980 The righttolife organization has targeted Senators Robert C Byrd DemocratWest Virginia Lawton Chiles DemocratFlorida Lloyd Bentsen DemocratTexas Paul S Sarbanes DemocratMaryland and James R Sasser DemocratTennessee but will pour as much as 500000 into an allout effort to defeat Senator Edward M Kennedy DemocratMassachusetts Our theory is that if you knock off the king all the little princes will fall said Paul Brown of Lapac As a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Mr Kennedy has consistently opposed the various proposed constitutional amendments to ban abortion Publicity is where we can be most effective said a Lapac spokesman We want to make a difference with the 2 to 5 percent of the population that we feel we can move from one side of the issue to the other Usually they are bluecollar ethnic or religious groups typically Democratic and urban Rather than trying to change peoples minds on the abortion issue the prochoice forces are attempting to mobilize what they see as their majority on the issue National polls have consistently showed 60 to 80 percent support for legalized abortion depending on how the question is phrased and in its organizing efforts Naral has focused on persuading those sympathizers that if they dont become active they may well lose what they now take for granted Younger women are the toughest group to activate Miss Falkenberg noted somewhat wistfully Older women understand almost viscerally what is at stake Prochoice leaders believe that the major legislative threat at the moment is a bill introduced by Senator Mark O Hatfield RepublicanOregon which would restrict all Federal funds for abortions and cut off funds for medical schools that teach techniques in abortion and for birth control clinics that make abortion referrals except when a womans life is endangered The bill would also make possible a speedier Supreme Court review of the abortion issue on the theory that this court would be likely to overturn the historic 1973 Roe v Wade decision barring virtually all government regulation of abortion in the first three months of pregnancy Other Bills Introduced Several other significant antiabortion measures have been introduced in the Senate In addition to the constitutional amendment to ban all abortions there is an amendment by Senator Orrin G Hatch RepublicanUtah which overturns Roe v Wade and gives power to the states and to Congress to restrict and prohibit abortions Senator Jesse A Helms RepublicanNorth Carolina has also introduced a new bill that would outlaw all Federal funding for abortion and research related to abortion The effect of the Hatfield bill is almost exactly the same as Helms Miss Falkenberg said but were afraid that it will be perceived as a compromise that many members will feel they can safely support In fact its effect would be devastating particularly on poor women
IN THE NATION; BATTLING THE 'BIG BOYS',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/15/opinion/in-the-nation-battling-the-big-boys.html,Theres an old saying in this state that the water wont clear up till you get the hogs out of the creek Thats what Jim Hightower claims anyway which suggests one reason the supposedly conservative Democrats of Texas have just nominated him  a selfproclaimed Progressive whos delighted if you call him a Populist  for Agriculture Commissioner Most observers rate him a cinch for election in November on a surprising ticket that includes Representative Jim Mattox for Attorney General Ann Richards for State Treasurer and Gary Mauro for Land Commissioner  all young Progressives Texans love a fighter Jim Hightower believes and a politician with a sense of humor both of which he is but he thinks he won primarily because most Texans dont like the big boys and will respond across liberal and conservative lines to someone willing to take them on The issue is that too few people have all the money and power he recently told The Texas Observer of which he used to be editor And everybody agrees with that I mean 90 percent of the people agree with it And theyre mavericks theyre disgruntled the big boys are taking too much It dont matter if youre talking about oil companies or supermarkets or utilities or  banks That of course is old stuff in American politics particularly in the South and the West Jim Hightower grew up hearing such talk on farms in Fannin and Grayson counties Fortyfive years ago in North Carolina my father would come home from working on the railroad to teach me the same unforgettable lessons This year in Texas Mr Hightower says what I was saying was true in peoples lives Farmers know theyre being ripped off by the grain trade Consumers know theyre being ripped off at the supermarket And he just may be right that progressive forces have let themselves be divided by social issues like gay rights abortion gun control and busing Theyve got too far away he believes from the glue that binds us together  that theme of gouging that were going to represent and let the Republicans represent the banker and the oil executives Mr Hightowers own record is his best evidence Formerly an aide to Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas then a respected Washington consultant on food and farm policies a veteran of Fred Harriss Presidential campaigns he ran in 1980 for a seat on Texass regulatory body the Railroad Commission I was mad at utility company gouging Campaigning personally all across this vast state against a wellheeled conservative opponent Mr Hightower polled a startling 48 percent  and hardly stopped running As president of the Texas Consumers Association he fought a publicized battle against a telephone company rate increase and by the time he became a candidate for Agriculture Commissioner he had 78 percent name recognition in the third most populous state This year in a countytocounty campaign that cost only 275000 he took 60 percent of the vote 76 in both Houston and Dallas ran well in all sections in cities and the countryside and defeated a wellknown incumbent But why Agriculture Commissioner I believe in executive office because you can do things he says Its not like running for Congress and saying youre going to fight inflation The Texas Agriculture Department in fact has a budget of about 17 million and administers 47 laws on everything from egg grading to foodprice fixing Its 600 employees in 28 field offices are involved in matters of energy water land use marketing The department has a daily radio program more than 20 monthly publications and a state airplane Mr Hightower plans to use these real tools to do real things for people  to reestablish farmers markets for instance thus bringing cash income to perhaps 30000 farmers providing cheaper and fresher produce to consumers and bringing both together He says he can also open up the international markets directly to our farmers bringing them even more cash Theres a bunch of power in the office he told The Observer Whether youre fighting a toxic dump going on a farm in your county or supermarket pricefixing in San Antonio or looking into how the railroads are screwing over the farmers by manipulating the graincar supply at harvest time Stuff like thats gonna be highly visible So of course is Jim Hightower He wont talk about higher office but hes happy to tell you who he plans to appoint to the 70odd highlevel jobs at his disposal Theyll be men and women wholl mix it up with the big boys and do things for people wholl maybe even run for office themselves some day And hes frank about his aims I am an agrarian reformer I want to tamper with the system On the record so far maybe the big boys better listen

FILIBUSTER ENDS ON VOTING RIGHTS; SENATE REJECTS WEAKENING CLAUSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/18/us/filibuster-ends-on-voting-rights-senate-rejects-weakening-clauses.html,The Senate worked until about 1 AM today on the revised version of the Voting Rights Act after Senator Jesse Helms halted his filibuster against the landmark civil rights legislation The Senate having rejected a series of amendments that would weaken the bill adjourned with several other amendments still to be considered Final passage was expected today Senator Helms threatened to renew his stalling tactics later in the debate but he conceded in an interview that his weeklong filibuster was running out of steam Weve done as much as we can do the North Carolina Republican said in terms of making senators aware of the implications of this bill Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who has been a leading foe of the voting rights amendments said it was only a question of time before the legislation passed You reach a point said Mr Hatch who did not join the Helms filibuster when youve done the best you can Once you do that theres no reason to prolong the agony First Substantive Vote In the first substantive vote on the bill the Senate defeated an amendment by Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina that would have made it more difficult for minority voters to prove that they had been victimized by discrimination The vote considered a key test by the bills supporters was 81 to 16 against Mr Easts proposal The lawmakers proceeded to defeat several more amendments offered by Mr East and Mr Helms Mr Helmss decision to let the Voting Rights Act move ahead at least for now was tied to a complex series of maneuvers that could determine the schedule of the Senate in coming months and the fate of many pending pieces of legislation In particular Mr Helms is eager to bring up a constitutional amendment providing for a balanced Federal budget and a bill that would virtually ban abortions by defining human life as beginning at conception Both bills could be jeopardized by a prolonged fight over voting rights Was First Adopted in 1965 The original Helms filibuster was mounted against the motion to bring the voting rights bill to the Senate floor A cloture vote which shuts off a filibuster but allows for extended debate was passed Tuesday On Thursday Mr Helms agreed to a vote on the motion to take up the bill The motion then passed by a vote of 97 to 0 At that point the Senate began consideration of the bill itself At least nine amendments were pending most of them aimed at weakening enforcement provisions of the bill which was first adopted in 1965 and has been amended twice since then The House passed its version of the bill last fall One point of contention in the Senate debate has focused on the permanent portion of the bill which bans discrimination in all 50 states The question which was addressed by one of Mr Easts defeated amendments is how that discrimination should be determined by the courts Proposed Change in Bill Under current legal interpretations plaintiffs have to prove that bias was intentional The bill before the Senate would change that standard and allow judges to consider the totality of circumstances surrounding a case including election results Supporters of the change say that intentional discrimination is very hard to prove Opponents as Mr East argued Thursday night say that examining the results of an election to prove bias would lead to racial quotas and proportional representation even though the bill specifically bars proportional representation The second conflict involves a temporary portion of the law scheduled to expire in August that requires all or part of 22 states to submit changes in electoral procedures to the Federal authorities for approval The Senate bill would extend that requirement for 25 years while allowing jurisdictions to escape the preclearance obligation if they could prove a 10year record of nondiscrimination Opponents of this section say it is too tough and have proposed a number of amendments Supporters say that onequarter of the covered jurisdictions could meet the standard and that any looser regulation would cripple the bills effectiveness Growing Irritation Expressed The action Thursday in the Senate began with supporters of the bill expressing their growing irritation with the Helms filibusterSenator John C Danforth Republican of Missouri said The question is whether this body and this process can be held up by this kind of verbal sitin As Senator Danforths comment indicated Mr Helms was angering even members of his own party who felt that he was destroying Republican credibility with minority voters Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader also stepped up the pressure by insisting that the Senate would take up no other business until the Voting Rights Act passed But along with this stick he offered Mr Helms a carrot consideration of the balanced budget amendment soon after the voting act goes through In addition Mr Baker promised Mr Helms a fullscale floor debate on the abortion issue after the Fourth of July recess Both sides denied that the promise was a direct tradeoff for Mr Helmss decision Thursday but given the folk ways of the Senate it did not have to be an open deal Mr Helms will need friends to pass his abortion bill and he was clearly not making any with his filibuster Once the Senate began actual debate on the voting rights bill the North Carolinian seemed to abandon his fight in order to save his ammunition for another day
AT THE MOVIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/18/movies/at-the-movies.html,ALL Australians says the Australianborn director Bruce Beresford think their country is the center of the world And they imagine that when the bombs start dropping theyll demolish Sydney and Melbourne because thats where everything happens This suspicion that they are the heart of the universe has led Australians to accept with equanimity the fact that their movies are so popular all over the world right now Mr Beresfords Breaker Morant made in 1979 is partly responsible for that popularity and now Dons Party made in 1976 but newly arrived in New York is doing its raunchy best to make Mr Beresford and Australia ever more famous Although he worked in Britain from 1961 till 1971 Mr Beresford went home again when the Australian Government decided to help finance a film industry and he made a very broad comedy called The Adventures of Barrie MacKenzie It was sneered at by critics who said it wasnt funny Somebody thought it was funny Mr Beresford says It was a very big commercial success Dons Party was Mr Beresfords first commercial and critical success Based on a David Williamson play Its David Williamsons life Its about his marriage breakup He was Don Mr Beresford says it was filmed in a real house at night We slept during the day and wed all turn up for work at 6 oclock in the evening and wed have a lunch at midnight The whole movie takes place over seven hours and to shoot it for five weeks and keep that party atmosphere going was hard Its a great credit to the actors that they never let it flag We won six Australian Film Awards I got the best director award I won it again with Breaker Morant Im the only person whos got it twice At this moment in his career Mr Beresford can write his own ticket He no longer has to fight for what he knows is right the way he did with Breaker Morant I was under a lot of pressure to cut 20 minutes out of it he says I said I spent 15 months scripting it its very intricately constructed and if you leave any one scene out the rest of it wont make sense We never did touch a foot of it which Im very glad about Mr Beresford has been married for 18 years  his wife is Irish they met in London  and has three children The children are amiable hes pleased to report Even though in the last few years theyve had trips all over the world theyre not hard to get on with If you say Were going hiking they dont suddenly say We want first class accommodations  Recently Mr Beresford finished a movie called Tender Mercies about a downandout country singer whos an alcoholic it was written by Horton Foote stars Robert Duvall and was shot entirely in the United States Next he starts on King David for Paramount But to this day he maintains his parents dont understand this film thing It wasnt until I started having some success that they started to realize I wasnt wasting my time How do they feel now Now theyre quite pleased Mainly because I support them Unlike Bruce Beresford Isabella Rossellini had parents who understood this film thing very well The child of Ingrid Bergman and the late Roberto Rossellini Miss Rossellini opened a month ago in a movie called The Meadow Made by the Taviani brothers The Meadow was scorched by critics who said its only reason for being was the appearance of Miss Rossellini One wrote that the camera finds the same sort of beauty mystery and grace in her that it sees in her mother Five feet 8 inches tall with cropped hair a small scrubbed face and a laugh that makes even waiters with tired feet smile Miss Rossellini at 29 years old looks 10 years younger I never lied it wasnt worth it she says but now because Im working as a model Ive started hiding my age At 19 she came from Rome to New York to learn English In Italy youre told if you learn English your future will be assured She got a job teaching Italian and soon she was doing interviews for Italian television The show was fun journalism she says a sort of Italian Saturday Night Live very hip and funny and Paolo and Vittorio Taviani saw me on television And then they met me in Cannes She went to Cannes in a roundabout way In 1977 my father was head of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival Paolo and Vittorio presented their 16millimeter film Padre Padrone and Father fell completely in love with it and fought very much for it to win the Golden Palm It cost 100000 was made for television and it won against the big 35millimeter films coming from America Germany all the big productions For 20 years Father had stayed away from the film business He was bored by the love story they told over and over He despised the artist attitude He had been spending his time mostly in Rice University trying to figure out how to make science films All his life everything was done in order to understand to learn He thought if people were more cultivated it would solve all problems even war But when they invited him to come to Cannes he went He said They offer me a microscope to look into a world that many people say I belong to and to figure out what films are all about these days I went with him because he was intimidated He was strong and like a lion but also very shy He was afraid that actresses would want to go out and have dinner with him I said Father you are 70 Nobody would But he was very vain and said You never know So please come and be my chaperone  Three days after the festival Roberto Rossellini died of a heart attack but the Tavianis and Miss Rossellini remained friends because at Cannes they had shared this moment of strong exaltation Until the time they asked her to play the lead in The Meadow she had no ambitions to act but her mother advised her to take the film And then Miss Bergman made a strange suggestion says Miss Rossellini She said Just keep it simple Dont do anything And I said If I dont do anything I will look like a piece of log But she was right I dont have the skills to try to embellish so I kept it simple and Im sort of proud I think I did a good job I wasnt pretentious But it wasnt great acting either Married to the director Martin Scorsese for the last twoandahalf years Miss Rossellini lives in New York and says her husband wasnt enthusiastic about her making The Meadow He said Oh my God an actress deliver me from an actress but when I showed him Padre Padrone I think he understood why I wanted to work with Paolo and Vittorio The year after her father died Miss Rossellini says everything changed in Italy and not just for her The terrorism started to grow Before that it had been easy for young Italians to identify with the left The left fought for civil rights for divorce for abortion But all of a sudden out of that left which held the promise of some sort of justice and a more modern sort of life came violence Moro was kidnapped There was a great sense of distress and confusion in the young people These days Miss Rossellini often travels to London where her mother lives Miss Bergman has cancer but refuses to be an invalid Shes had it for seven years now Miss Rossellini says Its debilitating and sometimes its terribly depressing but she deals with it She just made a film Shes very strong Michael Douglas will produce and John Badham will direct The Star Man a love story with a science fiction background for Columbia  The actor Tony Musante has optioned the Leonard Wise novel The Diggstown Ringers and will make his producing debut with the film  Part 2 of Rediscovering French Film the popular series at the Museum of Modern Art has

FRANCES SCLAFANI CONTINUING A RECORD OF SUCCESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/18/nyregion/frances-sclafani-continuing-a-record-of-success.html,There was one exception a grinning President Reagan told a crowd of New York Republican leaders yesterday to his pledge of neutrality until after the primary And that is our first woman Republican candidate he said and he leaned over to kiss Frances A Sclafani The President picked Miss Sclafani out from a dais of Republican candidates in the same room where a few hours earlier she had told the audience Today the Republican Party makes history Today we nominate the first woman to run for Attorney General of New York She spread her arms wide in a gesture of triumph We are the party of the future she shouted Greeted by Cheering Her fellow party members filled the Georgian Ballroom of the Sheraton Centre hotel with cheers and as Miss Sclafani hurried through the crowd to kiss her mother the partys state chairman George L Clark Jr said into the microphone Bobby Abrams start packing babe That Miss Sclafani with no political background no apparent source of campaign funds and even when the Republicans started their designating session on Tuesday little public recognition might be the candidate to oppose Robert Abrams for a third term seems improbable to many politicians Mr Abrams is soon to be awarded the Democratic and Liberal Party lines But then the fact that Miss Sclafani would be the unanimous choice of the leadership of the Republican Party had seemed equally improbable when late last year she started touring the state to round up support It seemed improbable that is to people who had not been previously exposed to Miss Sclafani Since the age of about 3 recalls her mother Tina she has been exceptionally determined A String of Successes And her job resume shows a series of successes debating champion and freshman class president at Queen of the Rosary Academy in Amityville LI scholastic success at St Johns University and its law school and an internship in the United States Attorneys office in Brooklyn Then without political support she got a job as a Suffolk County assistant district attorney Now six years later she is deputy chief of the felony trial bureau the first woman to hold the job Some months ago Republican party leaders approached the Suffolk District Attorney Patrick Henry about running for Attorney General He declined But naturally he said yesterday I thought of Fran Sclafani Naturally Mr Henry offered a list Shes young energetic experienced physically attractive female and Italian he saidAt his urging she traveled the state lining up support Right Person in Right Place Talk about the right person in the right place at the right time said Serphin R Maltese executive director of the Conservative Party  which plans to ratify the Republican decision tomorrow And then Miss Sclafani said briskly she will commence what she calls a peopleoriented campaign According to her family she has been adept at getting people to follow her since childhood Soon after Joseph and Tina Sclafani moved to West Islip so their only child could grow up in the suburbs her mother recalls hearing 10yearold Frances deal with the neighborhood children What shall we play today someone asked What do you think we should play Frances responded diplomatically But her mother recalls that they ended up playing what Frances wanted to play Daughter and parents still live in that same West Islip home Spends Spare Time Hiking Miss Sclafani says she spends her spare time enjoying Long Islands beautiful beaches hiking the outdoors Frances Ann Sclafani was born Aug 25 1949 in Brooklyn Her father is a purchasing executive her mother a poet As a firsttime politician she appears to be adapting easily to her new discipline She declines for instance to be drawn into potentially troublesome discussion of the socalled womens issues Abortion Its not an attorney generals issue she says Ill enforce the law But being the first woman to be a statewide Republican candidate is a plus she says and not merely because it will help attract attention The times she says are changing People are interested in women who are good public servants
VOTING RIGHTS ACT RENEWED IN SENATE BY MARGIN OF 85-8,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/19/us/voting-rights-act-renewed-in-senate-by-margin-of-85-8.html,In a decisive show of support for the civil rights movement the Senate today adopted a bill extending a critical section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for 25 years The legislation would also reverse recent Supreme Court decisions and make it easier for minority voters to prove racial discrimination The vote on the measure which has already passed the House in similar form was 85 to 8 House leaders have said they would accept the Senate bill and send it directly to President Reagan Mr Reagan who hailed the vote as a statesmanlike decision has already promised to sign it Signals From the Senate In a statement after the vote Senator Edward M Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat who is coauthor of the bill took a jab at Mr Reagans economic policies This victory he said is a heartening sign that Congress will not endlessly turn its back on the needy in our society and the minority who are not white To many lawmakers the vote was also a sign that the Voting Rights Act had worked effectively and that lawmakers must respond to the growing power of minority voters even in the South 4 Southerners Vote No Of the eight negative votes only four were cast by lawmakers representing states of the Confederacy And some of the sternest opponents of civil rights legislation in years past such as Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina backed the bill on final passage We said 17 years ago that the Voting Rights Act would transform this country said Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland the floor manager of the bill Today we have evidence of that William Taylor a leading civil rights lawyer added Clearly we couldnt have this kind of vote before people were enfranchised Lonely Filibuster Ends Todays vote came after more than 38 hours of debate stretching over a week For most of that time Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina stalled the proceedings with a lonely filibuster But he ended his delaying tactics Thursday night under mounting pressure from the Senate leadership and fellow Republicans who feared he was undermining the partys credibility with minority voters With the civil rights forces in full control the Senate then easily defeated a series of 18 amendments most of them aimed at weakening the enforcement mechanisms in the bill After the final vote Senator Helms denounced the bill as purely punitive political legislation He predicted that it would ultimately lead to racial quotas in election results and that as a result white voters would turn against the lawmakers who backed the legislation However Mr Helms said he exacted several promises from the Senate leadership when he agreed to abandon his filibuster One was a commitment that the Senate would soon consider a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget the other was a promise that Mr Helms and his allies would be allowed to bring up bills this summer to ban abortion and legalize organized prayer in schools When the abortion and school prayer issues do reach the Senate floor the roles played in the voting rights fight could be reversed with liberals forced to stall for time There will be a filibuster vowed Senator Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania 2 Sections of Rights Act The Voting Rights Act contains two principal parts the permanent section which bans discriminatory practices such as literacy tests in all 50 states and the temporary section which requires all or part of 22 states to submit changes in election procedures for Federal approval All of the affected areas have a history of past discrimination or low minority turnouts The bill passed today reverses recent decisions by the Supreme Court which ruled that if voters sue under the permanent section of the act they must prove that discrimination has been intentional Civil rights groups have argued that proving intent is very difficult so the bill says that judges can consider the totality of circumstances surrounding a case including election results The second major change would extend the temporary section for 25 years As the law now reads most states and local jurisdictions covered by the section would no longer have to submit electoral changes after Aug 6 However the bill also provides a detailed procedure that would enable these jurisdictions to bail out of the preclearance requirement To do so the district would have to show that for 10 years it had practiced no discrimination and had made positive efforts to aid minority participation in the electoral process Experts estimate that 25 percent of the affected areas would satisfy this escape clause immediately Debated for More Than a Year The debate over the voting rights amendments has gone on for well over a year For many months the Reagan Administration withheld support for the bill favored by civil rights forces but political pressures on the White House continued to mount Supporters of the bill organized a nationwide lobbying effort and moderate Republicans began to fear that the Administrations posture was alienating minority voters Mr Reagan eventually endorsed a compromise bill when it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this spring Today he said that the Senate vote sends a strong bipartisan message No Americans vote shall be defiled diluted or denied But civil rights activists said the Presidents long silence had already damaged his credibility This is an example of the President blowing it said Laura Murphy a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union The negative votes today were cast by Senator Harry F Byrd Jr Independent of Virginia and seven Republican Senators Mr Helms Jeremiah Denton of Alabama John P East of North Carolina SI Hayakawa of California Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire James A McClure and Steven D Symms of Idaho
A METAPHORIC NOVEL OF THE SEA,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/books/a-metaphoric-novel-of-the-sea.html,SABBATICAL A Romance By John Barth 366 pp New York G P Putnams Sons 1495 WELL have to stick to the channel John Barth wrote in his first novel The Floating Opera and let the creeks and coves go by His new work explores all the creeks and coves it can both literally and figuratively It drifts with what one of its characters calls the narrative tide it goes back goes forward stands still It begins with a storm at sea describes an uncanny island not to be found on any chart and records the surfacing of a hefty sea monster in Chesapeake Bay Have we sailed out of James Michener the narrator wonders into Jules Verne The metaphors as Barth said of his earlier use of them are not gratuitous and thats putting it mildly If life is like a voyage we read in Sabbatical a voyage may be like life Not the least of sailings pleasures in our opinion is that it refreshes by literalizing them many common figures of speech one is forever and in fact making things shipshape from stem to stern casting off getting under way  Barths list lumbers on making headway giving oneself leeway tilting a promising thought toward pedantry The implication is that symbol and reality unlike broken Humpty Dumpty can be put together again In practice reality comes off handsomely the boat the bay the weather clothes flesh language the looks and gestures of people  while the symbols clank like loosely stowed gear Sabbatical recounts the end of a voyage made by Susan Seckler a literary academic who is wondering whether to return to teaching andor have a child and Fenwick Turner her husband a former CIA man who has written in the manner of Philip Agee a scathing book about the Agency  his heart divided as he says between patriotism and dismay They have been married for seven years and have taken a winter off to sail the Caribbean and think things through and they come home now to the decisions they have not yet made Both are twins Susans sister was raped by a gang and tortured by the SAVAK the internalsecurity agency of the Shah of Iran Fenwicks brother was another CIA officer and has disappeared along with his son  they are presumably dead So the story fills up with the rough contemporary world The West sinks into the sun as Susan puts it Does the Company have a new drug that can induce utterly convincing heart attacks Fenwick has had two episodes his friend and former colleague dies of one in the course of the book Calm conversations hide secrets it becomes increasingly difficult to tell a promise from a threat Susan and Fenwick know their sabbatical is over yet are grateful for the breathing space They are conscious of their luck their privilege We are reasonably healthy reasonably successful reasonably well off  unpersecuted unoppressed and still in love after seven years of marriage the favored of the earth Is this enough Perhaps nothing is enough  the suggestion runs through Barths fiction from its beginnings But Susan and Fenwick survive  she an abortion and he his fear of losing her  and make their anxious homecoming into a story and their story into a shelter It is this story we read with Susan and Fenwick telling it and talking to us about it  about the story and about making the story The author far from being the demiurge of this world is their puppet Suppose Fenwick wonders about some information he feels the reader needs the author does it straight out instead of putting it into the characters mouths Susan is dubious but reluctantly agrees Your ship author Mostly Susan and Fenwick speak as we My hat is off to us Well done us This sounds elaborate it is elaborate but it reads easily enough and persuasively makes the story seem to belong to its inhabitants Fenwicks and Susans energetic worrying about each other and the significance of things is attractive and the book obviously represents the sort of spilling over of personal fact into fiction that Barth spoke of in Letters Whats involved here strikes me less as autobiography than as a muddling of the distinction between art and life BUT there is a flatness in the book that these likable characters cannot redeem Partly this is the result of the heavyhandedness that is felt everywhere That storm blew up like a sawedoff simile Fenwick says Mock solemnity keeps turning into the real thing To Susans mind it is appropriate that in a manner of speaking we are involved in a nighttime voyage one common feature of wanderinghero myths A Rumanian called Dumitru is known as DoMeTrue  because he does his happy mistress says Fenwick is descended from Francis Scott Key and Susan at least in family legend from Edgar Allan Poe local Baltimore lads and emblems of opposite Americas There is a lovable old Jewish grandma and a lot of jokes are generated by turning American as into Yiddish es as in fleshbeck and tex brecket I have a great fondness for terrible gags but these seem to me sadly striven for ungainly even serious lacking the reckless bad taste with which SJ Perelman say martyrized the language And the jokes alas go together with the books gravest pretension which is to surround the literal voyage with homilies about the stream of life and the sea of the womb Sperm swim up ova float down about forks in the river and shoals in a charted course To go forward we must go back The road is better than the inn Fenwick thinks switching his imagery to land Susan says to her mother Life is too strange Ma Platitude upon platitudeThe problem is not that Barth fails to deliver grander meanings but that he looks so hard for them so restlessly tries to convert a modest and engaging trip into a windfilled portent

HAVE HORROR FILMS GONE TOO FAR?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/movies/have-horror-films-gone-too-far.html, Elliott Stein writes regularly for Film Comment By ELLIOTT STEIN Recently the director John Carpenter appeared on the David Letterman television show and presented a clip from his latest film The Thing consisting of special effects footage of an Alaskan husky which has been invaded by an alien life form from outer space The creature was seen writhing and snarling dripping with repulsive liquid and baring long claws with which it pulled off pieces of a roof until it was dispatched with a flamethrower The studio audience was audibly entertained by the clip Mr Letterman then asked Mr Carpenter Would you send your 8yearold child to see the movie The director replied I would evaluate my 8yearold and then decide If I was 8 years old I would certainly want to see it As the director of The Thing a horror film opening Friday at local theaters Mr Carpenter is scarcely a disinterested party But as the newest army of monsters ghouls and yet unnamed creatures creeps and lurches onto the nations screens many parents and prospective moviegoers are likely to be doing precisely this kind of evaluating In a year that has already witnessed Paul Schraders markedly gory Cat People and Steven Spielbergs corpsestrewn production of Poltergeist and with such films as Incubus The Evil Dead The Loch Ness Horror The Winged Serpent Halloween III and George Romeros Creepshow in the offing  it seems timely to inquire into the impact of horror films on their mostly young viewers What do horror films do to those who see them  not merely to 8yearolds but to others especially to adolescents who have more discretion in their moviegoing Have filmmakers such as Mr Carpenter whose Rrated new release is a remake of 1951 film of the same title and Paul Schrader who remade the 1942 Cat People captured the subtle terror that made those two films cult classics or have they simply reveled in a new repulsiveness made possible by advances in the art of special effects Such questions become more pertinent as the level of goriness and violence in horror movies escalates In the older examples of the genre  classics such as Frankenstein and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari for example the fearful thing was most often set within the context of plots and stories and the fear itself emerged from the exploration of character or from relationships between the characters and the alien creatures But as the audiences tolerance threshold for chills and thrills went up and the technical capacities to create monstrous and grotesque effects increased horror films have come to rely more and more on sheer explicit representations of the ugly and the terrible  and less on psychological fable artful suggestion and the filmgoers imagination Mr Carpenters The Thing for example is a horror film with sciencefiction underpinnings set at a scientific outpost in Antarctica and constructed around a polymorphous and perverse creature which absorbs any living shape it can get its otherworldly tentacles on Its victims turn into pulsating globs of transmogrified ectoplasm  one of them is a giant spider with a human head  and each one of these special effects becomes a star turn The original The Thing produced in 1951 by Howard Hawks the great director of Scarface Twentieth Century The Big Sleep and Bringing Up Baby was a fastpaced 86 minutes B sciencefiction movie with some horrific elements and some humor It comes to a reasonably happy ending The vegetable monster played by James Arness and described by one character in the film as a carrot with brains is destroyed the world is saved at least for the time being and the young lovers an Air Force pilot and a pretty secretary to the Arctic expedition whose romance supplied the audience with a few light moments can now get on with it and get married Similarly Mr Schraders version of Cat People in contrast to the poetic fantasy of the 1942 Jacques Tourneur version features an autopsy performed on a panther with a human arm springing out of the beasts innards for good measure And Mr Spielbergs recent Poltergeist shows a man raking the flesh from his face to reveal the skull below not to mention innumerable gaping coffins with their human remains in various states of graphic decomposition The earlier Cat People was one of the modest series of B thrillers produced by Val Lewton at RKO during the 1940s all of which turned their back on the explicitly horrific They are unsettling mood pieces in which dreadfulness is indirectly suggested The first treatment of this story of a woman Simone Simon who believes she will turn into a panther and kill those she loves is gracefully and inventively directed In avoiding the standard effects of monstrous humanintobeast changeovers it takes its cue from the great German director Fritz Lang  that nothing the camera can show can be as horrible as what the mind can imagine The original Cat People employs shadows and distorted sounds to convey unseen terrors through suggestion the everyday becomes nightmarish Expanding on his televised remarks during a subsequent interview Mr Carpenter said Any film that is by its nature exploitive of something whether its violence or sex is not necessarily a good film or is it a good experience If I was a parent and I had an 8yearold child or a 10yearold child I would evaluate my child to find out whether he was impressionable emotionally mature before I would let him see any horror film I would be as responsible in that area as possible However one feels about depictions designed to inspire terror it should be noted such efforts have a long and generally honorable history A line can be traced from The Thing back to Edgar Allan Poe to the 19thcentury Gothics to Jacobean theater to medieval mystery plays to Beowulf and beyond  to the Cyclops cannibals and the visits to the dead in Homer In film monsters have come and gone in cycles since the birth of the motion picture Thomas A Edison made a Frankenstein in 1910 and there were a few early versions of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde but the first true cycle of horror films began in Germany with the release of Robert Wienes The Cabinet of Dr Caligari in 1920 Its stylized acting bizarre story and above all its Expressionistic sets created a nightmare world which made it the most discussed and analyzed film during the first half of the 1920s Its three principal characters  a mad doctor a monster who obeys him and a girl who is abducted by the monster  became an eternal triangle whose reappearance would guarantee the success of hundreds of later shockers The uneasy Germany of the period was the ideal nesting ground for fantastic and disturbing creatures Caligari was followed by Nosferatu 1922 Wax Works 1924 The Hands of Orlac 1925 and The Student of Prague 1926 By the end of the decade many of the most talented members of the German film industry had left for the United States where the next great cycle would take place That cycle  the golden age of the American horror film  would bear a strong Germanic imprint Todd Brownings Dracula made by Universal in 1931 proved to be Americas Caligari It was a tremendous hit Universal led the field during the entire decade Frankenstein 1931 was followed by The Mummy and The Old Dark House 1932 The Invisible Man 1933 The Black Cat 1934 The Bride of Frankenstein and The Werewolf of London 1935 and Son of Frankenstein 1939 Mr Brownings Freaks made at MGM in 1932 derived considerable power from its compassionate treatment of authentic carnival freaks It appalled the public and critics and was withdrawn from circulation for many years When reissued in the 1960s it was acclaimed as a masterpiece Frankensteins Monster and King Kong RKO 1933 evoked a surprising amount of popular affection from children and adults Both creatures more sinned against than sinning gradually became icons and American culture heroes The next significant cycle appears with the work of Val Lewton at RKO In 1942 with Cat People the studio embarked on a series of lowbudget thrillers produced by Mr Lewton which have become cult classics Since the days of Mr Lewton major accomplishments seem to have been rare Among the highlights are Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 Mr Tourneurs The Night of the Demon 1958 Mario Bavas La Maschera del Demonio Black Sunday 1960 Robert Wises The Haunting 1963 and Hans Geissendorfers Jonathan 1972 But while the art of such films seems to have been in decline the emphasis on violence blood and gore in horror films has escalated dramatically A significant step was taken in England in 1955 when Hammer films began a 15year cycle of lowbudget horror films in vivid color starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing It was the first massive dose of heavy violence in mainstream cinema reinforced several times a year with each new Hammer horror And these were accompanied by the birth of a subgenre one the industry cynics quickly dubbed the splatter movie whose goal was not primarily suspense or fright but the exhibition of explicit gore The message was mutilation in such films as I Dismember Mama and The Corpse Grinders In 1967 the prestigious Bonnie and Clyde by no means a horror film served in a way to legitimize gore Although extremely violent it had been scrupulously crafted by Arthur Penn a respected director was widely seen and liked and generally favorably reviewed More recently there have been a handful of violent horror films of quality which have revealed directors of talent George Romeros The Night of the Living Dead was released the year after Bonnie and Clyde In its wake came The Texas Chainsaw Massacre directed by Tobe Hooper of Poltergeist Larry Cohens Demon John Carpenters Halloween and David Cronenbergs The Brood Should children see such films any of them Child analysts psychologists educators and some specialists in the field of horror offered a variety of answers Unexpectedly one filmmaker said that current movies are too explicit Yet some of the psychologists believe that horror films hold nothing to equal the repulsiveness of events in real life And others assert that certain movies that many parents regard as childrens classics are actually films that terrify youngsters beyond all others Dr Peter B Neubauer childrens analyst director of child psychology and a professor at Columbia and New York University said I have noticed over the years a more fearful response from children to The Wizard of Oz than to any other film The witch is particularly frightening to them because the movie begins realistically  at first we see the witch as a neighbor woman before the film becomes fantasy Does anyone anywhere have any direct data on the effects horror films have on children Dr Neubauer asked I have never seen any A study on television released last month by the National Institute of Mental Health concluded that there is now overwhelming evidence of a causal relationship between violence on television and later aggressive behavior It was the sort of finding that would raise the question of the effect on youngsters of repeated exposure to horror films Children who have a normal home life can differentiate reality from fantasy said Dr Neubauer But if to begin with there are deep emotional problems at home they can link the movie horror to the family problems But really what we are doing to children today in real life is far worse than what any film could ever do to them In agreement with this assessment is Phyllis Ackman a psychologist who treats adolescents For some of the kids I have seen who have witnessed bloody murders not on the screen but in real life or for 13yearold girls facing the prospect of abortion  a horror film simply validates their daily lives she said Monsters loom in the lives of children long before the children are ever exposed to monsters in movies noted Baylis Thomas a psychologist and psychotherapist Nearly all children draw pictures of monsters before they have ever seen a movie They see pet animals die a chicken carved they gradually realize that they can be separated from loved ones and come to feel that the world is a terrifying place  well before they are taken to the movies Films are not the source of their fears  childrens fears have to be weighed against any simple notion of cause and effect brought on by movies Mr Carpenter who grew up to make The Thing said I went to horror films as a child I loved them I knew they were fantasies I knew they were escapist entertainment I understood that what I was seeing was not real I enjoyed being taken on a journey into the imagination through movies Mr Carpenter said that The Thing was intended to be a monster movie but was not intended to be repulsive The star of the movie is the monster he said My attempt in making The Thing was to make the most outrageous the weirdest and the most unforgettable monster of all time It was not to repulse and it was not certainly to harm anyone The movies that most frighten children according to Maureen Gaffney a producer of educational films whose work at the Media Center for Children includes the programming of films for childrens institutions include several that parents are most likely to regard as classics It has been my experience she said that the three films which have always frightened children most are The Wizard of Oz Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs They see the wicked witch as an evil mother figure and the wizard as a neglectful and threatening father figure I dont at all believe that fantasy or even violence in films are bad per se It depends on what is being said The old classic shockers are not bad for children Far from it they are educative and thrilling Frankenstein is a myth about an industrialization which gets out of hand and King Kong is a Hollywood parable about show biz  taking something out of its natural environment promoting it and having it turn on you Both these movies are about social situations The trouble with most of the horror films made now is that there is no serious content They reflect no myths they have no center They are just pure sensation but that is a reflection of our times because so many adults are living lives of pure sensation Horror films arent bad for kids  they love a good scare especially when they go with friends and its a group experience A distinction between the impact of horror films on adolescents and their impact on younger children is drawn by Dr Harvey R Greenberg clinical professor in child psychiatry Albert Einstein College of Medicine Adolescents are perpetual seekers of thrills and can see any kind of film without harm he said Small children can be traumatized and should be kept away from movies that can shake them up What worries me about todays movies is not their potential effect on children which is not easy to assess but the horrifying extent to which they reflect a culture that is falling apart In an article on Alien and the contemporary horror film which will appear in the Psychoanalytic Review Dr Greenberg states that he regards Disney as the cruelest of great fantasy filmmakers and that Disney films contain scenes that send kids under the seats during the performances and straight into nightmares afterward Richard Gordon who produced two Boris Karloff films and whose recent productions have included Horror Hospital The Cat and the Canary and Inseminoid is one filmmaker who thinks some movies may have gone too far Violence certainly has become overexplicit Mr Gordon said It does away with subtlety and artistry  and from my end of things it takes the fun out of making horror pictures I really dont believe they have any bad effects on children whereas I am sure that gruesomely realistic stories of crime in the streets can do them damage  it makes them afraid of everything in their daily lives Kids take horror films as fairy stories I always did I loved them thats why I make them For those who believe that todays horror films have gone too far there is hope The red tide may be receding Although 95 horror films were made in English last year only 15 have begun shooting so far this year We could be witnessing the twilight of the ghouls
A PHILOSOPHIC NOVEL OF ACADEME,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/books/a-philosophic-novel-of-academe.html,MICKELSSONS GHOSTS By John Gardner Illustrated by Joel Gardner 590 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1695 A midfiftyish SUNYBinghamton philosophy professor named Peter Mickelsson is sinking fast under the weight of the usual  drink women career problems intellectual conundrums the age the IRS troubled kids The wife Mickelsson is divorcing is moneymad and the elegant colleague he loves is twotiming him with a department chairman he abhors His national reputation as a philosopher disposed to wrestle with public issues is in decline a blockbuster book hes started writing in a comeback bid keeps stalling out and hes afraid hes lost his touch with his students His radical son has disappeared after running a violent nonukes protest As for the IRS An erratic filer Mickelsson owes an amount larger than the sum of his salary from here to retirement and is under constant harassment by mail phone and personalized spy Hanging tough the philosopher buys an old farmhouse on tick on the woodsy outskirts of Susquehanna Pa assembles tools and begins doing the place over room by room Its a selfrenewal project and for a time it goes well  but only for a time Imprudently falling in with some Susquehanna lowlife Mickelsson finds himself seized by an obsession with a local teenage prostitute When the teenager becomes pregnant and tells Mickelsson the baby is his hes driven to criminal action in order to pony up the fee the girl demands for not aborting the child Mickelsson is a passionately principled righttolifer Meanwhile in another rather Joyce Oatesian part of the woods weirder problems are surfacing In yesteryear Mickelssons farmhouse sanctuary was it turns out not only the residence of Joseph Smith the Mormon prophet but the scene of a murder the place is haunted Real and projected ghosts commence walking Murky deaths and disasters multiply among Mickelssons neighbors and students and nobody knows whether theyre suicides or murders accidents or arson cases Nightmares shriek madness beckons At the violent crisis with the philosopher close to the edge a Mormon fanatic bangs at his door bearing arms and threatening his life commands him to tear apart the rooms hes just finished rehabilitating Mickelssons fresh plaster the fanatic fears hasnt adequately plastered over a church scandal thats hidden in the walls JOHN GARDNERS subjects as a novelist have ranged from the inner conflicts of a beleaguered monster Grendel 1971 to a brothersister feud in contemporary rural Vermont October Light 1976 The strongest point of connection among his works of fiction is their unvarying hospitality to ideas The Resurrection 1966 his first novel is also about a philosophy professor  a fellow given like Mickelsson to ruminating on Hegel Collingwood that bunch The dialogues in The Sunlight Dialogues 1972 have philosophical themes the Sunlight Man is himself a former professor and both he and the books hero Fred Clumly a chief of police love chattering about big ideas So too in different ways do the splendid monster in Grendel and the farout Vermont farmer James Page in October Light who locks his sister in her room after shooting out an infernal TV with his rifle Its a rule seemingly that a Gardner novel will be  in at least one of its dimensions  the story of somebodys intellectual life And for part of its extreme length Mickelssons Ghosts obeys the rule As with any novel set in academia theres a measure of plain socializing in its pages the inevitable stiff academic dinner party and a good deal of caricature the inevitable artsyclerksy faculty musicale But theres also highly unusual in academic novels  a serious representation of teaching and thinking Gardner lets us audit two lively philosophy classes Just how fascistic is Platos Republic is the issue in the first the second treats differences between moral and esthetic judgments Mickelssons students are quicker with general ideas than most students and although the teacher frets about losing his touch he sounds fine to me Were offered a believable account of peaks and pits in the desk life of an academic essayist and at intervals the novelist engages a genuinely challenging philosophical theme namely the minds endless and doomed  hunt for selfknowledge The whole history of evolution then Mickelsson asserts in a characteristically knotty passage of reflection from hydrogen to ape that can sing its own song the explosion up and out with its innumerable mistakes and misjudgments and false starts and down at the heart of things its fierce determination creating against all probability in defiance of the limits of natural selection homing in through the millennia with maniacal singlemindedness on its dream of the unthinkable the human eye the juxtaposed thumb the brain was the history of that primal blind Mind in pursuit of selfknowledge that is Gods rise into selfawareness In the early going Gardner works hard and effectively to maintain a tight seal between the particulars of his heros emotional life and the brainier flights of his fancy What does an aging philosophers infatuation with a corrupt teenager signify about mans nature What are the roots of the souls misgivings about abortion What kind of solace can physical labor afford Why is disbelief in manifestations of the supernatural both vulgar and foolish The questions spring directly from the specifics of the heros dailiness and the notion that he as a philosopher might undertake to address them in philosophical terms seems entirely reasonable But as the book proceeds the gap widens between thought and action mental events and turns of plot The task the author has set himself emerges as that of yoking a novel of sensibility and ideas to a mystery tale about Mormons bent on hiding seamy secrets of the saints from hostile eyes In theory this isnt an impossible task A decently loose and baggy novel is supposed after all to be capable of accommodating everything from toothbrushes to apparitions And links do exist between Mickelsson and Mormonism Theres his ownership of the Joseph Smith farmhouse to begin with And Gardner tightens that link by introducing as the villainous Mormon zealot a colleague of Mickelssons whos been presented earlier as a gently urbane rationalist and by suggesting that a presumed suicide among Mickelssons students is actually a murder victim done in for stumbling on a Mormon saints secret STILL despite these efforts the marriage of philosophy and mystery doesnt come off largely I think because as Gardner thickens his plot he thins out his voice The Mormon line of narrative in Mickelssons Ghosts brings with it a termitelike infestation of crimestory cliche The novelists voice grows duller and flatter loses variousness and flexibility The intricate emotionladen questions about supernatural manifestations and the sanctity of life give way to Then why was Thomas Spragues house burned Who cut his throat All at once were in a world of snubnosed pistols and eyes closed to slits people stopped in their tracks who shoot looks at each other stand up needing to pace or cry out Wait a minute as Solutions Dawn The hopedfor successful mix of tones and modes doesnt materialize and the novelist behaves as though hed never had anything in mind in the first place except unraveling in standard crimestory jargon a perfectly conventional mystery Criticism Gardner wrote in On Moral Fiction gives us art cleaned up and clarified at worst reduced to what the critic considers its main point complicated emotional developments are transformed into logical progression and artistic vision becomes thesis Implicit in this contention is Gardners pride that his own art resists cleanup and in truth it has done so on occasion  witness the remarkable blend of novelistic forms and voices in October Light  and undoubtedly will do so again But the book at hand leaves an impression of selfdilution and diminishment Reductively simplifying the complicated emotional and intellectual quandaries with which it begins Mickelssons Ghosts does to itself something more harmful even than what the author thinks criticism does It transforms the stuff of its own potential vision not into a thesis but into canned goods  a standardbrand thriller with a queer Gothic hum in the background
POLITICIANS CONFRONT NEW CONSTITUENCIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/archives/politicians-confront-new-constituencies.html,THE United States Constitution decrees that every 10 years the population of the country shall be counted Its a safe guess that some public figures in this county would have been happy to skip the latest count  or to have seen it carried out differently Because the 1980 census showed a sharp decline in the states population New York State will lose five Representatives this year Because the decline was sharpest in New York City there will be fewer members of the House of Representatives from the five boroughs  and because reapportionment after the census also included state legislative districts there will also be fewer assemblymen and state senators New Congressional and legislative districts reflect an outward pressure from city into suburbs Legislators from the citys periphery find their districts expanding into the county and their counterparts here whose constituencies have become cozily familiar are confronting new district lines new territory and the need to make themselves known and accepted by thousands of new voters  all in the scant six months before the election Most incumbent state and Federal legislators will be running again but none will be running in exactly the same district he represented last time It calls up memories of an old childrens game whose watchword was Change seats  the Kings come Hardly any legislator stands to gain decisively from the reapportionment Best off are those whose seats were solidly safe before and who are not made significantly more vulnerable by the reshuffling Among these Representative Hamilton Fish Jr and State Senator Mary B Goodhue are notable examples both have hammerlocks on their northcounty constituencies and Mr Fish is not likely to be harmed by the addition of voters from conservative counties such as Dutchess and Orange to replace those lost in Westchester towns Representative Richard L Ottinger may have less to fear from redistricting than from the nature of his Republican challenger Assemblyman Jon Fossel In two terms in Albany Mr Fossel has established himself as a bona fide moderate conservative on fiscal matters but courageously liberal in the social areas where Mr Ottinger has also taken forthright stands  the supersensitive abortion issue for example If 1982 were to be a Republican year in the 1980 mold the OttingerFossel contest could well be a horse race But the incumbent is known districtwide his record of service to constituents is formidable in the face of the 1980 Republican sweep he was reelected by the largest margin ever There are suggestions that 1982 may not be a Republican year and that Mr Fossel will emerge as a sacrificial lamb A sturdy lamb however of whom more will undoubtedly be heard later If Mr Ottingers opponent were not Jon Fossel but Mary Goodhue the challenge would be even more substantial But Mrs Goodhue after toying with the idea rejected a run citing the importance of her position as lone the Republican female Senator and unfinished business in Albany Because the Senator is known to aspire to Washington service one suspects that the call of duty in Albany was less influential than a conviction that Mr Ottinger was unbeatable Politicians as a group have a deep primal urge to move up  as witness Mayor Kochs blithe repudiation of his pledge to serve out his city term Mrs Goodhue is not the only politician electing to stay put this year Supervisor Charles DiGiacomo of Cortlandt virtually unkown outside his north county town thought about running for Mr Fossels Assembly seat but removed his hat from the ring because of pressing business in Cortlandt he might try for Congress later he said or maybe County Executive Unequivocally a loser from redistricting is the countys other Democratic Representative Peter A Peyser Mr Peysers district was earmarked by the legislature as one where a fair fight could be staged to seal the horsetraders bargain As a result the Congressman who formerly represented the western section of the county finds himself on the defensive in a new district taking in considerable territory west of the Hudson where Representative Benjamin Gilman holds sway Starting as a Nixon Republican Mr Peyser has moved increasingly toward liberal positions changing his party affiliation in the process and has established himself quite solidly with his constituents Whether he can extend his mandate into new turf against another popular longtime incumbent is an open question Among those who secretly regret the decennial census though Mr Peyser probably holds pride of place He would have to contest that distinction however with Assemblyman Peter Sullivan Mr Sullivans margins of victory in his White Plainscentered district have sometimes been slim now he will be trying his luck in a new district lapping far into the northern county where voter preference runs to a less doctrinaire Republicanism than the Sullivan variety Confronted by a choice between a rejiggered old district and a move north he chose the northern option and announced that he would change his place of residence accordingly Election Day will show whether Mr Sullivan picked the right horn of his dilemma It is not only the legislators of course who are affected by redistrictings outward push The citizens must also accommodate themselves to new representation their reaction may be delight or dismay or just uneasiness Mrs Goodhues district for instance stretched south as far as Scarsdale and her working relationships at the southern end were mutually satisfying Senator Joseph Pisani will take over and his new constituents will be alert to how the shift affects them Mr Sullivan falls heir to some of Assemblyman Fossels territory  and the Fossel act is a hard one to follow Beneath this entire migration there is a basic irony  that it probably should not have taken place That the 1980 census was gravely flawed is acknowledged the courts declined to amend the New York City figures upward but that doesnt mean they were accurate Thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of city residents eluded the net some because they were illiterte some because they shied away from any contact with officialdom some by reason of the fundamental inefficiency of a mail census in a city of teeming slums For whatever reasons it seems clear that much of New Yorks population decline is a paper loss  a monumental error Unfortunately it is not an error that can be corrected The county in consequence will live at least for the next decade with the implications of an unpalatable reality that what was a cutanddried job 200 years ago has become like other things in our time too much for a baffled body politic to handle
HOW CONSERVATIVES VIEW U.S. POSTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/21/us/how-conservatives-view-us-posts.html,Bob Billings is a Christian evangelist who believes that rock music sex education and homosexuality are bad and that we live in a corrupt decadent society But Ive had to softpedal my views says Mr Billings who took a job high in the hierarchy of the Department of Education last year If I was on the outside I could be more vocal Nonetheless Mr Billings the former director of Moral Majority and a graduate of Bob Jones University is quietly pushing a social agenda within the Reagan Administration that reflects his fundamentalist Christian views I have not changed my principles he says I have changed my tactics Mr Billings is one of a number of New Right and Christian Right advocates who are trying to use their positions within the Reagan Administration to influence and reshape the Government in accordance with their politically conservative philosophies Their efforts range from broad attempts to slash Government spending for what they call leftist advocacy programs to a narrowly focused effort to put a conservative stamp on the Department of Educations official magazine Some have pushed to rid their departments of individuals and programs that they consider too liberal Others have focused their pressure on the White House urging the President to come forward with specific proposals on such social issues as a Constitutional amendment authorizing organized school prayer and tax credits for tuition payments to private schools On the Inside Now Some of these very conservative political activists were invited to help run the Government they once viewed with distrust after they helped get Ronald Reagan elected in 1980 Most had never worked in government before and many say they chose positions in domestic areas so that they might be able to carry out the agenda they had promoted as outsiders A few such as Surgeon General C Everett Koop an evangelical who opposes abortion on religious grounds are highly visible Others such as Charles Heatherly and Donald J Senese two staunch conservatives who are in subCabinet positions in the Education Department have low visibility but wideranging responsibilities Many others serve on Presidential advisory panels or work parttime as field readers evaluating grant applications Besides Moral Majority and Bob Jones University other conservative or Christian Right organizations whose members or former members now workin the Federal Government include Young Americans for Freedom and a number of profamily and prolife groups that oppose abortion and regulation by the Government of what they see as family matters Bob Jones Dean in Grant Job Richard Leiter dean of the business school at Bob Jones University at Greenville SC a fundamentalist college that Federal courts have said is racially discriminatory is now reading grant applications for programs aimed at bringing minorities into graduate institutions I was supposed to be serving on the Presidential Advisory Commission on Adult Education Mr Leiter said But when the publicity came out about Bob Jones University they decided not to have me on They said I could do it later on Other Bob Jones faculty members also have positions with the Education Department one as an evaluator of grants for womens educational programs and another as a special Department assistant A third is a member of a Presidential advisory panel on education matters Like Bob Billings most say they view their jobs as a chance to spread the philosophies they brought to government I want to influence things however I can Mr Billings said by what I read what I write what I say how I act Weekly Offfice Prayer Meeting A Baptist minister Mr Billings holds a weekly prayer meeting in his office at the Education Department He says he considers himself the Christian Rights advocate within the department Sometimes Mr Billings helps his constituency in tangible ways getting the President to send a telegram to a conference of fundamentalist pastors or asking the National Institute of Education to investigate a package of sex education materials which he calls smut At other times it is harder to trace which of the seemingly conservativeinspired changes at the Education Department are actually attributable to Mr Billings or other New Right and Christian Right advocates The changes range from the dismissal last spring of Under Secretary William C Clohan Jr who was said by many conservatives to be too liberal to the hiring of Susan Phillips a grantwatcher who monitors Federal grants for Conservative Digest as a 52000ayear consultant Ive Tried to Help Them Mr Billings denies having a role in such matters But he says On other issues the Christian Right has called and Ive tried to help them all I could within the limit of law Among the other Christian Right or New Right conservatives who have joined the Administration is Morton Blackwell former editor of the New Right Report He has been given a job in the Administration that he describes in part as White House liaison to conservative groups Mr Blackwell is a busy man these days now hurrying to Lynchburg Va to visit the Rev Jerry M Falwell of the Moral Majority now taping Mr Falwells Old Time Gospel Hour program now setting up meetings between conservative religous leaders and his boss the President Mr Blackwell helped draft the language for both the school prayer amendment and tuition tax credit legislation Currently one of his top priorities is cutting Government support of what he calls leftist advocacy groups List of Advocacy Groups What are leftist advocacy groups Have you seen the Conservative Digest Mr Blackwell asked He picked up a copy of the April issue and opend it to a list of LeftLeaning Groups That Get Your Tax Dollars The first name on the list is the American Bar Association Its doing an awful lot of advocating in the legal area Mr Blackwell said The list also includes the League of Women Voters and the Audubon Society as well as more avowedly liberal groups such as the National Organization for Women Meetings With Administration To determine how to cut funds for such groups Mr Blackwell said he set up a series of meetings earlier this year between top Administration officials including the White House aides Edwin Meese 3d and James A Baker 3d and top conservative leaders including Howard Phillips Paul Weyrich and Richard Viguerie as well as Ronald Godwin of Moral Majority Clearly there is less money going to advocacy groups in 1982 than 1981 says Mr Blackwell noting that many grant application officials had been replaced by people who share the Presidents philosophy The only other magazine on display in Mr Blackwells office the other day beside the Conservative Digest was The Review of the News which featured a cover photo of Mr Blackwell and a long interview with him The people who put it out are John Birch Society he said Of the profamily conservatives in the Reagan Administration JoAnn Gasper a deputy assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department is one of the best known Column on Domestic Violence For years Mrs Gaspers column in Conservative Digest attacked homosexuals and other perverts and the social Gestapo and antifamily forces in Washington In a column titled Beating Up on the Family she wrote that the concept of domestic violence was so vague that it could mean any form of belittling or teasing or failure to provide warmth Whatever that may be  I guess if you dont set the electric blanket high enough in the winter Now Mrs Gasper is in charge of reviewing Government regulations concerning domestic violence as well all other social policy regulations One of her first actions when she joined the Government last fall was to approve a controversial regulation requiring notification of parents when minors receive contraceptives from Federally financed clinics When Ive had the opportunity she said Ive supported traditional family values
IN THE NATION; The Baptist Switch,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/opinion/in-the-nation-the-baptist-switch.html,The Rev Dr Bailey Smith of Del City Oklahoma who left office last week as president of the Southern Baptist Convention did not go gently into that good night In the prepared text of his farewell address he proclaimed it inexcusable for a Southern Baptist  To say he is a humanist and be proud of it  To say Genesis is political rhetoric and not historical fact  To teach evolution in our schools  To pray for the opening of a brewery or to social drink and have no shame about it Aside from the deplorable fact that all too many Southern Baptists  like members of other denominations observe that last commandment sketchily if at all Dr Smith may have caught the dominant mood of the convention In a hotly contested presidential election the Rev Dr James T Draper of Euless Texas another strict fundamentalist defeated the moderate candidate the Rev Dr Duke McCall by about 57 to 43 percent In a historic switch moreover the Southern Baptists abandoned their traditional opposition to any conceivable connection between church and state I remember the Baptists of North Carolina in the 1930s as the hawkiest of hawks on this issue But at their New Orleans meeting last week Southern Baptists became the first major denominational organization to support  by an estimated 3 to 1  the proposed constitutional amendment to allow voluntary prayers in the public schools The atheists humanists and secularists are against prayer in schools and thats not the company we need to be keeping said the Rev Morris Chapman of Wichita Falls Texas But ironically enough what appears to be happening among Southern Baptist pastors and congregations if not in the church bureaucracy is that theology  which was traditionally separational  now is being sacrificed to the political I refrain from saying secular goal of a constitutional underpinning for religion The two decades since 1963 when the Supreme Court held publicschool prayers unconstitutional have after all been years of enormous upheaval in American social standards and attitudes the sexual revolution the crime epidemic school busing and affirmative action the loss of American military and economic supremacy to mention a few All in the fundamentalist view can be attributed wholly or in part to a decline of moral values and growing resistance to spiritual guidance Judicial activism though now stalled and the secularity of the press also have become major irritants to the fundamentalists As Dr Richard R Gilbert chairman of the American Values Institute describes the result The devil of a religious establishment now appears not as dangerous as the devil of secular humanism in the public schools So the evangelicals are being manhandled by the fundamentalists among Southern Baptists Dr Gilbert a Texan well acquainted with the denomination says there is little difference in the personal religious view of the two both are Biblebelieving Christians But as he sees it the fundamentalist insists that this is the only acceptable view Dr Smith put it this way in his valedictory There is only one kind of Christian on Earth and that is a bornagain Christian  a person without Jesus Christ is only one heartbeat from eternal hell The New Orleans vote was in any case a considerable political development The 13 million Southern Baptists are the largest denomination in the nation and lately among the most politically active They made their votes felt for Jimmy Carter one of their own in 1976 then spurned him for Ronald Reagan in 1980 perhaps the fundamentalists again outvoting the evangelicals Its hard to imagine moreover Congress passing the school prayer amendment with the Southern Baptists opposing it as they have in the past But almost coincidentally with the Southern Baptist vote Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican abandoned his revanchist filibuster against renewal of the Voting Rights Act He explained that he had sold out dear by obtaining agreement from Majority Leader Baker to bring the school prayer amendment to a vote this summer That together with President Reagans announced support the Southern Baptist conversion and polls showing as much as 69 percent of the public favoring prayer in the schools might well get the amendment through Congress in 1982 Its hard to vote against prayer particularly in an election year And if the Republicans following Mr Reagans lead prove more supportive of social issues such as prayer in the schools and an antiabortion amendment the Democrats could be badly hurt in Southern states and Congressional districts they need to hang on to or regain but in which the Southern Baptists are a formidable force Thus might the fundamentalists yet gain secular revenge for their years in the wilderness of modern America
60-Second Debate; Should a limit be placed on the amount of money a Congressional candidate can get from political action committees?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/23/us/60-second-debate-should-limit-be-placed-amount-money-congressional-candidate-can.html,Dan Glickman Democratic Representative from Kansas Yes PACs are not inherently evil nor do Members of Congress consciously sell their votes based on PAC contributions It is naive however to think that the PACs of the AFLCIO or the Chamber of Commerce Right to Life or the National Abortion Rights Action League groups to the left or to the right are spending incredible sums of money out of simple altruism Their PACs and the many many others contribute to campaigns for one reason only and that is to influence the political process with their special interest goals Contributions from PACs have skyrocketed from 85 million in 1972 to an estimated 100 million in this years Congressional elections Since PACs represent narrow interests that often times take precedence over the public interest there can be an erosion of consensus building a crowding out of consensus government In high school mathematics I learned that the whole is supposed to equal the sum of its parts In the world of politics and PACs however the addition of all the special interest groups does not necessarily add up to the public good To restore public interest and influence in the political process it is important that we limit PAC contributions Dan V Cogman President National Association of Business Political Action Committees No What is the real issue in the growing debate on whether or not to limit political action committee contributions to federal candidates Is it the decline in political parties Or the advantages it gives to incumbents Or that individuals have no voice in determining where this special interest money is contributed Nonsense The only reason for a decline in party giving is that Congress has put a limit on what they can contribute Incumbents arent given an advantage by PAC giving the trend is clearly to helping challengers and openseat candidates Special interest groups are composed of individuals and a recent nationwide survey of corporate PACs showed an overwhelming 97 percent of those surveyed used some type of employee committee to determine who received campaign contributions The real issue is competition and the fact that business is developing a greater involvement in the political process Where was this righteous indignation when organized labor was alone in influencing the Congress The employees of business have just as much right to participate as others Competition is what makes our democratic system survive Organizing competing involvement by individuals of every shape and form  even those who work for business and give of their own hard earned time and money  this is what makes our political system work Any legislation which further regulates the right of free citizens to participate in the political process is counterproductive to what the democratic system of government is all about
54-45 SENATE VOTE PASSES THE BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/us/54-45-senate-vote-passes-the-budget.html,The Senate gave final approval today to a Republicansponsored compromise budget for the fiscal year 1983 ending a tumultuous fivemonth Congressional debate on national priorities The action set the stage for a new struggle over whether Congress is willing to enforce its budget plan The partyline vote of 54 to 45 was a victory for President Reagan and the Republicans and a defeat for the Democrats especially the liberals who fought a losing battle against new reductions in social programs An Element of Posturing In another vote however Congress defied the President and gave final approval to a supplemental appropriation that he is expected to veto because it contains a 3 billion housing subsidy that Mr Reagan regards as inflationary The House approved by voice vote a Senate bill that would also repeal the tax break that Congress gave itself The Congressional action on housing contained an element of posturing because Congressional leaders expect a veto and plan in that event to pass quickly a version of the measure without the housing subsidy The Senate tonight adopted and sent to the President legislation already passed by the House that would increase the debt limit to 1143 billion from 1079 billion The vote was 49 to 41 The measure expires Sept 30 and conservative Republicans have vowed to use the next debt limit extension as a vehicle for Senate action on abortion school prayer and other social issues Mr Reagan praised the 51 Republicans and three Democrats who provided the victory on the adoption of the budget and who he said refused to take the low road and return to the discredited quickfix policies of the past The three Democrats were John C Stennis of Mississippi Howell Heflin of Alabama and Edward Zorinski of Nebraska Three Republicans voted against the measure Lowell P Weicker of Connecticut Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland Howard W Cannon Democrat of Nevada did not vote Fulfills Reagan Objective The budget plan fulfilled Mr Reagans objective of seeking to change the direction of the government lessen dependence on its funds and programs and reduce its rate of growth The 7698 billion spending blueprint was nonetheless opposed by some Congressional conservatives because it projected a deficit of 1039 billion The measure commits Congress to the greatest peacetime increase in military spending and significant reductions in virtually all other domestic spending It also commits Congress to raise taxes and reduce social spending five months before a national election Senator Pete V Domenici chairman of the Budget Committee who shepherded the measure through the Senate said Five years ago if somebody had told me that this time in an election year the US Senate would have taken action that will significantly reduce spending in some popular programs and significantly increase taxes I would have said that was impossible  Difficult to Implement The Senator a New Mexico Republican acknowledged however the problems posed by the coming elections and said that the budget will be difficult to implement He said that although Congress intended to send a message to the financial community that would result in lower interest rates They have reason to be skeptical that we will not carry out the decisions of this budget Earlier in the debate Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina former chairman and now ranking minority member of the Budget Committee pointed a finger at Mr Domenici and warned Weve got a political document here that wont stand the light of implementation You wont have the troops you wont have the votes House Approves Supplemental Bill The Senate vote came as the House heeded the Senates request to approve an urgent supplemental appropriation bill that Mr Reagan had threatened to veto The House had earlier bowed to the threat of a Presidential veto interred the measure and approved a 45 billion supplemental appropriation bill without the housing subsidy This socalled clean bill is expected to be enacted after the veto and the battle over the housing subsidy will be resumed next month Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr said that the Democrats were merely postponing until midJuly their fight on the housing subsidy The Speaker then made a personal attack on Mr Reagan He has no care and he has no concern and hardheartedness all along the line Mr ONeill said of the President He has a heart like a ton of ice Senate liberals also charged that the budget plan would exact a toll in human suffering Whose senators are we asked Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio How can we be so cruel that we dont see the impact of this budget This budget will hurt millions of Americans Its unfair inhumane and unjust Assessment by Budget Unit Even before the Senate acted the Congressional Budget Office found that the measure would provide for more spending and a higher deficit than projected The figure of 7698 billion for spending was really 7755 billion the office reported and the carefully worked out 1039 billion deficit was really 1164 billion Although the budget projected a deficit of 60 billion for the fiscal year 1985 the budget offices estimate was 927 billion The budget plan directs Congressional committees and then Congress to approve changes in laws necessary to raise 20 billion in new taxes and to make spending cuts of 66 billion It provides for a total of 59 billion in reductions from what otherwise would have been spent on benefit programs and 63 billion in reductions in nonmilitary discretionary spending Although the cuts will be recommended by the committees the budget assumes a 36 billion reduction in Medicare a 700 million reduction in Medicaid a 900 million reduction in food stamps and a 500 million reduction in Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Child Support Enforcement among other reductions The budget plan will automatically become binding if as expected no second budget resolution is adopted by Oct 1 the beginning of the new fiscal year

MOVIES AND POEMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/27/books/movies-and-poems.html,PASOLINI A Biography By Enzo Siciliano Translated by John Shepley Illustrated 435 pp New York Random House 20 POEMS By Pier Paolo Pasolini Selected and Translated by Norman MacAfee with Luciano Martinengo Foreword by Enzo Siciliano 231 pp New York Random House Cloth 1050 Vintage Paper 595 PIER PAOLO PASOLINI was violently murdered near Rome on Nov 2 1975 He was only 54 years old but he had managed to produce a lifetime of work in several genres The publication of a translation of the first biography of him by Enzo Siciliano and a volume of translations by Norman MacAfee of Pasolinis best poems remind us what an extraordinary man he was He had gained fame first as a poet in the dialect of his native region Friuli  the area north of Venice that extends into Yugoslavia Soon he switched to Italian in which he went on to publish more than 40 volumes of poetry fiction travel notes and cultural and political criticism But it was as a film maker that he won international fame His first feature Accattone was released in 1961 Three years later he made his spare smoldering Gospel According to Saint Matthew His biggest successes at the box office at least in Europe comprised The Trilogy of Life of which the best was the innocent spontaneous and delectable Arabian Nights His last film Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom was surely his masterpiece an appalling study of sadism in the last days of Italian Fascist rule No film has come closer to genuine Satanism Salo seems as much a transgression against decency as a condemnation of evil The man behind this work was an enigma Pasolini led an exemplary life in the sense that he embodied most of the contradictions troubling modern Italy He was a sort of Marxist and off and on a Communist but his politics were too personal too shifting and too adversarial to fit into any orthodoxy He was an atheist but two of his films The Gospel According to Saint Matthew and Teorema received awards from Catholic organizations Moreover he had a devout respect for what he considered divine in human beings youth the body spontaneity He was a bigcity sophisticate and moved easily in international film circles but like his exact contemporary the Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima also a globetrotting cosmopolite Pasolini rejected the glossy consumer culture that had made him famous in favor of the standards of an earlier more rigid and more traditional society The greatest social change in the industrial world since World War II has been a shift away from conservation to consumption and in the consumers themselves a corresponding movement away from an ethic of selfsacrifice to a hedonistic code of selffulfillment Both Pasolini and Mishima opposed this fitful always painful and disruptive process Both of them had a utopian vision of an earlier more honorable more disciplined time Thus Pasolini argued against the liberalization of the abortion law on the grounds that sacrificing procreation to pleasure is a way of Americanizing sex making it into a diversion More broadly Pasolini bitterly ridiculed the economic miracle that quadrupled Italian income in the 1960s but also polluted the nations shores and countryside led to wholesale migrations of workers out of southern Italy and created a tacky mass culture Similarly Mishima scorned the industrialization Westernization of Japan To be sure most political theorists would say that Pasolini was on the left and Mishima on the right Pasolini felt that the Italian Communist Party was the only decent uncorrupted longsighted and humane political organization in the country Indeed he was from a poor family and his own early years of deprivation made him champion the poor everywhere not only in Italy but also throughout the third world he wrote a book about India and another about Africa By contrast Mishima was from an upperclass family and he committed seppuku ritual suicide by disembowelment in the name of emperor worship and a return to a feudal code he even had a private army In short Mishima was a fascist and Pasolini a communist But underneath that ambiguous distinction one can detect strong affinities between them Both were powerhouses who almost hysterically produced works in many genres Mishima wrote plays novels and poems and practiced body building and martial arts Pasolini was tireless throughout his adulthood typically tossing off a novel while shooting a film Both men were homosexuals who were remarkably well integrated into heterosexual social circles and who worked overtime in order to transcend the isolation imposed on them by their sexual identity Mishima was married though he was quite public about his homosexuality Pasolinis great friendships were with the actress Laura Betti the singer Maria Callas and the novelists Elsa Morante and Alberto Moravia all of them heterosexual Given the cult of machismo in Italy Pasolinis candor was a tribute to his feistiness He had been hounded out of Friuli and out of the Communist Party on charges of corrupting the morals of three teenage boys He and his mother fled to Rome where over the years he was subjected to other legal actions But none of these efforts to repress him silenced Pasolini he referred quite openly to his homosexuality in his regular newspaper columns and employed it as a theme in many of his films But my point is that though both Pasolini and Mishima were frankly even scandalously homosexual Mishimas first book is the semiautobiographical Confessions of a Mask neither man withdrew from the world into the gay subculture of Tokyo or Rome Both were determined to be dominant figures of their national artistic and intellectual life and both succeeded publicly although neither could ever overcome private feelings of alienation Finally one should point out that both men died violent deaths  Mishima by his own hand Pasolini in a ghastly encounter with a young Roman hustler who beat him and then ran over his body with an automobile The facts of Pasolinis murder remain cloudy At the time Communists insisted that several Fascists had killed him for political motives and then covered up the crime and discredited Pasolini by staging the event as a sordid encounter with a prostitute Those who didnt interpret his death politically interpreted it morally as though the excesses of Salo had invited just such violence Surrendering to paranoia or blaming the victim seem to be the only possible responses to what probably and more horribly was merely random violence Was Pasolini a great artist His Gospel According to Saint Matthew is a radical and original reimagining of the Christ story in the terms of peasant culture filmed in a corresponding visual style of poverty Salo is great for its unforgettable assault on the senses and sensibilities of the viewer Of his copious writings his poems seem the most likely to endure In the United States we have become used to a poetry that is subjective dreamlike mysterious obvious only in its agitated or exalted state of emotion Pasolini wrote poems of a very different sort His poems which have been translated now with clarity ingenuity and fidelity by Norman MacAfee are chatty letters to the world by turns confessional and polemical Of the confessional poems the most convincing is The Tears of the Excavator in which Pasolini recalls his years as a poor schoolteacher when he lived in a shantytown outside Rome Of the polemical poems A Desperate Vitality will shock Americans with its explicit references to names and political jargon as in a film by Godard  rediscovery  of romanticism in the seat of  neocapitalistic cynicism and cruelty This is not the vatic tone of American lyricism Indeed an American who reads Enzo Sicilianos biography of Pasolini is struck by how much Pasolini was immersed in ideology To us a writer is political only peripherally when he or she makes political pronouncements But Pasolini worked in a milieu where an artist was supposed to situate each of his works in an ideological context and to have a ready opinion on every occasion about Freud Marx and LeviStrauss Mr Siciliano himself is the same sort of intellectual At times the American reader feels daunted when encountering such a sentence as The conflict in essence was between a residue of traditional humanism to be revitalized through Marxist historicism and neopositivist sociological thinking imbued with existential inhibitions No matter Mr Siciliano tells the fascinating facts clearly enough and with sympathy he was a friend of Pasolinis the story is steadily absorbing
MILLICENT FENWICK: MARCHING TO HER OWN DRUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/27/magazine/millicent-fenwick-marching-to-her-own-drum.html,William E Geist is a reporter on The Timess metropolitan staff Out beyond the crumbling piers and cities and the smell of textured air New Jersey belies its blighted reputation and becomes the Garden State a land of green pastures trees and money of horses fox hunts and Republicans Here west of Newark lies one of the wealthiest of the nations 435 Congressional districts and it seems altogether appropriate to those who live there that Millicent Fenwick should be the latest in a long line of patricians to represent them in Congress Perhaps not politically for she is often more liberal than they But Well my dear as she so often says the r perfectly silent Millicent Fenwick is above politics Nothing that she says or does seems to diminish her popularity Constituents tend to describe her as a national treasure and write her in for President Now their Representative is running for the United States Senate and there seem to be few political observers in the state who believe she will not win a seat there in November Voters tend to view Millicent Fenwick as a charming anachronism a plucky woman of wit and elegance who sends handwritten notes to constituents and scolds fellow Congressmen for their moral failings Her colleagues describe her variously from one of the great minds in Congress to selfrighteous and just plain flaky Critics question how much substance there is behind her seemingly indominitable political style To them her extraordinary popularity can be almost maddening In the June 8 New Jersey state primary Mrs Fenwick dispatched Jeffrey Bell a 38yearold friend of the President and one of the architects of Reaganomics who had defeated the venerable Clifford Case in a 1978 Senate race Against Mrs Fenwick Mr Bell spent more than 2 million an unprecedented sum for a New Jersey primary much of it garnered from conservative Republicans nationwide who wanted the more liberal Mrs Fenwick out of Congress But there was reason to believe the White House which wants a winner in November was pulling for Mrs Fenwick who has never lost an election And on election night Mr Bell conceded That Millicent magic was just too much Mrs Fenwick now faces the Democratic candidate Frank R Lautenberg of Montclair a 57yearold political newcomer and millionaire business executive in the race for the Senate seat vacated by Harrison A Williams Jr also a Democrat following his conviction on charges resulting from the Abscam investigation National attention is already focusing on the Senate campaign which is expected to be heated and wellfinanced as the Democrats attempt to overcome Mrs Fenwicks personal appeal and regain the seat Mr Williams resigned During the primary campaign Mr Bell complained that he could not get the attention of the news media It seemed that editors reporters and television news people kept asking themselves Do we want a story on an intense intelligent man discussing the overhauling of the Federal Reserve System and a return to the gold standard or a 72yearold millionaire pipesmoking grandmother a former fashion model and Vogue editor who seems to answer every question with startling candor and is widely believed to be the model for the character Lacey Davenport in the Doonesbury comic strip neither she nor the cartoonist Garry Trudeau will say for sure And it seemed to Mr Bell they just kept coming up with the same damned answer Mr Bells camp reasoned logically enough that Mrs Fenwicks noble manner would not serve her so well outside her horseandhunt Congressional district in a state dominated by Newarks Jersey Citys and Camdens And there was her age a delicate issue considering that of the President and not an easy issue to press given Mrs Fenwicks reputation for 14hour days Still a 72yearold woman running for a sixyear term If not Mr Bell now asked one of his advisers then who when The question goes unanswered Mrs Fenwick defeated him with more than 54 percent of the vote At 72 years of age Mrs Fenwick is powered by pacemaker her own substantial energy and some sense that time is running out She operates on her own timetable If her political consultant John Deardourff wanted a crew to film her walking to work for her primarycampaign commercials they were to be outside her Washington apartment at a few minutes past 6 in the morning As the crew scurried to keep up with her Mr Deardourff suggested she take a path by the illuminated Capitol dome a powerful and emotive backdrop I do not walk past the Capitol on the way to work she said leaving him with footage of her descending into a House officebuilding parking garage I dont have time for these games she explained Senator DAmato told me he did a study of why hed won election she said referring to Alphonse DAmato the junior Senator from New York as she opened a battered steel door and walked toward the service elevator the quickest route to her office He found it owing to a commercial in which his dear mother held a bag of groceries and implored viewers to vote for her son Al She paused Well my dear I cannot help thinking that is not quite what Thomas Jefferson had in mind Begrudgingly Millicent Fenwick hired a political consultant for the primary because John Deardourff was an old friend An outspoken opponent of obscene campaign spending she expended only 32578 on her last House campaign  about what it costs to win a seat on the Hackensack City Council Much has been made of Mrs Fenwicks personal wealth  estimated at 5 million which she says is too high  but nearly all of it is tied up in trust funds from which she only derives income Major funding for her Senate race will have to come from individual contributions for she is steadfast in not accepting money from politicalaction committees PACs  a policy most of her colleagues in Congress call tantamount to not accepting food or water Her campaign staff hopes for substantial help  as much as 1 million  from the Republican National Committee since many there believe this is the partys best chance to turn a Democratic Senate seat held for 24 years by Mr Williams into a Republican one Millicent Fenwick has not changed her campaign style since she ran for the Bernardsville Borough Council In the same oldfashioned way that has served her so well she still speaks to large numbers of small groups At the start of a primary campaign day she drove her clean gray 1976 Chevrolet to a breakfast meeting of the Morristown Jewish War Veterans entering through the restaurant kitchen without benefit of entourage She was dressed as is her custom in sensible shoes one of her tailored 1940s wool tweed suits  not 1940s style suits mind you but 1940s suits  and with a long strand of pearls wrapped four times about her neck On the day she addressed the Jewish veterans group Mrs Fenwick looked very much like the model she once was poised and erect better than 5 feet 10 inches tall and about 110 pounds Only her face now wrinkled with age betrays the passing years She praised the veterans for their service to their country in war and for their volunteer service to the community She mentioned a recent visit with Prime Minister Begin and told of her support for Israel and her opposition to the sale of Awacs to Saudi Arabia All to be expected But then right over the lox and bagels and cream cheese she said that she supported the Nazis right to march in Skokie Ill In a voice filled with emotion she declared We must defend the rights of everybody even those with whom we disagree But we must rouse in ourselves some equal passion  We must turn to good will and stand for it She reminds me of Churchill said one member of the audience during the lengthy standing ovation Eleanor Roosevelt said a second Katharine Hepburn said a third A woman identifying herself as a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp stepped forth to disagree with Mrs Fenwick about the Nazis march but after a brief debate said that although she was a Democrat she would change her registration and vote for Mrs Fenwick But why had she raised her stand on the Nazis at all I tell each group my opinions on every issue I think they are interested in she answered taking a puff on a small pipe filled with Amphora tobacco On the advice of her doctor she substituted smoking a pipe for chainsmoking cigarettes some years ago Indeed she would later tell a conservative gathering in Montclair a suburb with school busing that the country ought to continue busing as a reminder of what we stand for She told a group of postmasters that something must be done about exhorbitant Government pensions She told the Haddonfield Republican Club that she is basically against tuition tax credits a broad death penalty and school prayer  all causes shown by polls to have the overwhelming approval of New Jersey Republicans She delivered a rousing speech to a group gathered around a private swimming pool in Tenafly about the need to stop further cuts in programs for the poor The wealthy must start making some sacrifices too she declared But from each group she received a standing ovation In a way I dont care what she says commented someone in the Tenafly crowd Its refreshing just not to be patronized I love my district she said as she wheeled her car down another expressay during a blur of campaign stops pointing things out along the way When I was in the State Assembly quintuplets were born in that house there and workmen put on an addition free of charge I wish life were more like that As she drove past a factory where 200 workers have been laid off she said Its a tragedy But you know our businesses just arent very peppy and it started a long time before interest rates went up Theyve got to get with it We cant be using Government money to shore up failing businesses On her way to an assemblage of 7000 Ukrainians in Bound Brook she stops for lunch at her home a Frenchstyle stucco house with a large glass portico up a winding driveway on 14 acres in Bernardsville She spends most of the time that she is there in a large bright room with yellow carpeting 13foothigh French doors oil paintings plants thousands of books and an old box radio At lunch there are finger bowls fresh flowers from the grounds and asparagus from the greenhouse I try to watch what I eat she explains My opponents are all waiting for me to keel over It is in this house that she was raised and has lived most of her life Millicent Fenwick was born Feb 25 1910 to a family of wealth and prominence Her father Ogden Haggerty Hammond was a New York financier and her mother the former Mary Picton Stevens was a descendant of John Stevens for whom the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken is named She reflects on the happy insulated early years of childhood in the then 50room house watching her parents off on spins in a 1913 Packard with brass lanterns claypigeon shoots on the lawn and movies in the attic Then Mummy went to Paris she recalls staring out a window at the swimming pool built in 1914 to establish a hospital She was on the Lusitania when it went down I can remember as if it were yesterday Mrs Fenwick attended the exclusive Foxcroft School in Virginia leaving at the age of 15 when her father was appointed Ambassador to Spain She never graduated from high school Later in life she studied philosophy at the New School for Social Research under Bertrand Russell She attributes her ability to speak four languages fluently and to quote extensively principally to selfstudy When she was 19 she returned to Bernardsville to attend fox hunts and balls and to create a family scandal by falling in love with Hugh Fenwick a married man from neighboring Far Hills whose wife was summering in the Hamptons It was rather seamy she says of the affair Her family did not approve but she was adamant They married in 1932 and had two children Hugh and Mary but were later divorced Mr Fenwick is remembered by others as an enormously charming rascal Mrs Fenwick never remarried and speaks with some sadness of the importance of a fulfilling marriage Deeply in debt she went job hunting to support herself and her two children After being rejected for a departmentstore job selling stockings because of her lack of education she modeled for Harpers Bazaar She later landed a job as a writer and editor at Vogue but her financial situation was precarious She recalls the process server being at her door each Friday night when she returned home from New York for the weekend and admits to a story that she used to let her car roll down the hill to the commuter train station to save gas In order to hold onto the family homestead she was forced to tear down all but the library of the mansion The old house required a ton of coal per day in the winter she explains There was just no way The beams screamed terribly when they were ripped apart Ever since she has lived in the twostory library still the size of an ample house Wherever he is she says without bitterness of her former husband who is still alive I hope hes as charming as ever In 1952 she began receiving enough income from the family trusts to quit her job but needlework and gardening did not hold her attention for long She became active as a volunteer for among others the NAACP political candidates a prisonreform group and the the county legalaid society She was elected to the Board of Education and became the first woman member of the Bernardsville borough council The project she most often recalls to audiences in this Age of Reagan is being chairwoman of the Recreation Commission and building the municipal swimming pool without a cent of taxpayers money by collaring architects masons plumbers and electricians to donate their skills and materials In 1969 she was elected to the New Jersey State Assembly where she earned the nickname Outhouse Millie because of her campaign for better working conditions including bathrooms in migrant labor camps She also developed a reputation for being a sharp wit When an anti equalrightsamendment legislator said I always thought women were meant to be kissable cuddly and sweetsmelling she retorted Thats what I thought of men  and I hope you havent been disappointed as many times as I have She was appointed state Director of Consumer Affairs in 1972 resigning to be elected in 1974 at the age of 64 to the United States House of Representatives She has been reelected three times by everincreasing margins in 1980 by 78 percent In her dedication to work Millicent Fenwick leads an almost monastic existence When in Washington she rises at 445 AM has breakfast fusses with her largely uncooperative hair and leaves her fourroom apartment at a few minutes past 6 for the halfblock walk to work Her footsteps echo in the canyon corridors of the Federal office building carrying her past the closed offices of her colleagues Before her door lies the morning mail a tightly bound bundle a foot thick She opens the mail herself saving the string from the bundle and answers the letters from human beings individuals rather than organizations and officials with handwritten notes At 630 AM the only sound is her pen scrawling rapidly across paper telling one constituent how to go about getting a father into a nursing home another how to straighten out a problem with Social Security benefits promising to contact the Rumanian Ambassador about a visa for the brother of another She passes two letters across the desk one from a 74yearold man frightened by an illness another from a 23yearold woman who writes that she has lost her sense of valuesYou dont answer letters like those with a typewriter she says In Bernardsville where she is listed in the telephone directory constituents can call and talk out their problems with her This is how she delivers for her constituents an aide explains Her district isnt much interested in dams and miltary bases Much of what I think needs to be done comes from individual problems Mrs Fenwick says Later in the day she will explain to the Long Branch Rotary Club in Washington on a field trip how one of her letters resulted in changing a law nationwide to allow local people preference in federally financed housing for the elderly so that they might stay nearer their families and friends One letter she exclaimed Intermittently during the day she is off at a near gallop to committee hearings In the subway that runs between the office building and the Capitol she encounters a group of New Jersey highschool students who have their photographs taken with her Are you really Lacey Davenport one of the students wants to know She answers Well you know in one of them Lacey sees a group of strikers out and she looks at them and says Oh you poor dears I can hear myself saying that She steps onto the Members Only car with Billy Evans a Democratic Congressman from Georgia who recently raised about 60000 at a 250ahead cocktail party for lobbyists Aware of this Mrs Fenwick strikes up a conversation concerning the obscene nature of fund raising in Washington today pointedly noting that she does not take contributions from lobbyists or politicalaction committees Much of her fund raising is done at small gatherings such as the chic dinner given during the primary at the McLean Va home of Zbigniew Brzezinski national security adviser during the previous Democratic Administration Asked about his support of someone in another political party Mr Brzezinski said Shes just damned good We need a lot more like her Mrs Fenwick explained that these tea parties she would collect 10000 to 15000 at this one were essential to her fund raising When you dont take PACs you look for pals Mrs Fenwicks legislative interests have been wide ranging She wrote the bill creating the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor implementation of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement particularly its humanitarian principles Her work in this area is wellknown and nearly everywhere she goes there seems to be someone asking her help to bring relatives from Communistbloc countries to the United States Her Congressional committee assignments are House Foreign Affairs Education and Labor and the Select Committee on Aging Sometimes she is ahead of public perceptions states her profile in Politics in America a Congressional Quarterly publication She began calling for truck deregulation to lower food costs years before it became a popular cause She gainedpublicity for her bill to end the marriage tax a version of which became law She has also introduced legislation to prevent cuts in the foodstamp program to compensate workers disabled by exposure to asbestos to protect consumers from businesses that go bankrupt to limit providing sensitive technology and items with military uses to countries which support international terrorism Some in Washington see her cut in the mold of other Northeastern Republicans wealthy white AngloSaxon Protestants who have entered politics out of a sense of noblesse oblige and who have little in common with many of their colleagues In this sense they see her representing a dying breed although it has clearly been force of personality rather than wealth that accounts for her political success She is widely viewed in Washington as a maverick Republican a fiscal conservative and a moderatetoliberal on social issues although her votes for President Reagan last year on budget and tax cuts brought her closer to the mainstream of the party Although she at first backed George Bush for President she says I like Mr Reagan He works from the ground up rather than the statistic down Thats been my approach Her American Conservative Union rating leaped from a cumulative 35 average over seven years to a 73 in 1981 based largely on her votes for Reaganomics The average House rating was 63 Remarkably however she also rated above average 40 with the liberal Americans for Democratic Action scoring a 55 because of her votes opposing both further cuts in the Health and Human Services budget and funding for the MX missile system B1 bomber and certain aircraft and naval vessels She supports further budget cuts in agricultural subsidies as well as cuts in the 11 billion in tax concessions to the oil industry Weve had it social and educational program cuts she has said Regarding Social Security she says These benefits amount to a contract that cannot be broken without a long lead time About abortion busing and school prayers I believe that we should not tamper with Supreme Court decisions To try to alter them would be a threat to our Constitution She supports the equal rights amendment She opposes further cuts in assistance to college students but voted for last years which she believed necessary to limit aid to those who need it most Her voting record does not impress everyone Although her harshest critics in Washington are liberal Democrats Representative George Miller Democrat of California was the only one reached who would speak openly She consistently talks about caring for children and the poor and then votes budget cuts in Head Start in the Womens Infants and Children nutrition program and in Title I education programs for the disadvantaged You cant have it both ways Either she doesnt know what shes doing or shes a hypocrite Mrs Fenwicks response to that is Those programs were part of a reconciliation budget proposal  which was Mr Reagans effort to change the direction of Government spending and by God it had to be changed She produces figures showing that the budget of each of these programs was actually increased only not as much as Mr Miller had wanted It infuriates her to be charged with balancing the budget on the backs of the poor She recalls that Brendan T Byrne a former Governor of New Jersey and a Democrat said that he would have to close five daycare centers because of Mr Reagans budget cutbacks Well I looked into that she said It was costing 390 a month for each child  at a time when the state was contracting out children to privately run centers charging 210 a month  Government has got to do the job where its not being done but not at twice what rich people pay for the same service An unnamed Democrat in the New Jersey delegation criticized her in a Washington newspaper article earlier this year saying Shes not into the hard work of putting together coalitions necessary to get legislation passed What she enjoys doing is getting forums and making innocuous announcements Several liberal Democrats leaped to her defense Stephen J Solarz the Democratic Representative from Brooklyn who has served on committees with her wrote a letter to the editor in which he said There is probably no member of the Foreign Affairs Committee who participates more regularly and actively in the work of the full committee and the subcomPage 58 mittees on which she serves than Mrs Fenwick  On such disparate but important issues his letter continued as sanctions against Rhodesia military assistance to El Salvador and nuclear nonproliferation Mrs Fenwick has been deeply and significantly involved not only in the drafting and development of legislative compromises but in building the kind of broadbased support that is indispensable for their enactment She acknowledges a bad habit mentioned by many critics that her conversations often jump from subject to subject  electricity rates in Hopatcong NJ to cutting aid to Mozambique  her mind moving along as impatiently as her feet James Courter probably the most conservative of the New Jersey Republican delegation says I truly believe that most of her critics are jealous of the tremendous attention she receives Part of the criticism seems to stem from her being in the club that is Congress but not of it She routinely skips functions such as the recent 1000aplate Republican SenateHouse campaign dinner where the President was the keynote speaker and which was attended by virtually every other elected Republican in Washington She went home instead to cook spaghetti to cover it with Kraft Parmesan cheese and to go to bed her nightly routine There is a certain camaraderie says a critic on the staff of the Democratic leadership that allows things to get done around here She seems selfrighteously aloof from all that An aide to another Democrat says She doesnt play ball We put something in the highereducation bill for her constituents and she still voted against it What kind of deal is that Another critic says There is a lot of resentment about her attitude on pay raises Shes rich In 1978 Mrs Fenwick protested passage of a Congressional pay increase with an unrecorded vote and sent the Federal Government a personal check for the amount of her raise Her colleagues in Washington believe that she would continue in much the same fashion in the Senate speaking out on the moral obligations and failings of the country and of the Congress rather than concentrating principally on forging legislation There is some ego in seeking the Senate office sure says Mrs Fenwick But I believe ones voice can be heard more clearly in that chamber and I am at the point in my life where if I have anything to say Id better say it Her advisers believe that Mr Lautenberg whose personal wealth is estimated at 14 million is the most formidable of the nine candidates who entered the Democratic primary He spent more than 1 million of his own money on a substantial television campaign to overcome his lack of public identity and political base and his staff say he is prepared to spend 3 million on the generalelection campaign Mrs Fenwick spent 140000 of her own money in the primary race lent the campaign 186000 and is being pressed by her political advisers to spend 25 million for the new campaign Mr Lautenberg the chairman and chief executive officer of Automatic Data Processing ADP plans to campaign against Reagonomics which he blames for the high rates of bankruptcies and unemployment and other economic ills and points to the success of ADP as evidence that he has better ideas It is noted by political experts that if the recession worsens the votes Mrs Fenwick cast for some of Mr Reagans economic policies could well become an albatross It is also noted that there are half again as many Democrats as Republicans in New Jersey there is also a large  46 percent  independent vote and that only one New Jersey Republican has been elected to the Senate in the last 30 years But they also believe that conventional analyses do not apply when Millicent Fenwick is running They make her the heavy favorite because as one of them puts it The voters love her its as simple as that Asked what she will do if she loses  her Congressional seat will be filled by someone else in the November election  Mrs Fenwick answers with indignation You know what I say to defeat So what  If she does lose she says she will return to the volunteer work that she was involved in before she entered politics in the areas of prison reform problems of the elderly conservation civil rights and legal aid I suppose I wouldnt have time for my pen pals or to attend the Jewish War Veterans breakfast if I were Senator she reflects with a note of sadness But it would be a bully pulpit now wouldnt it my dear

WOMEN'S POLITICAL HABITS SHOW SHARP CHANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/30/us/women-s-political-habits-show-sharp-change.html,The political habits of women appear to be undergoing deep changes that worry the Republicans and raise the longrange hopes of the Democrats A variety of newly available statistics show that women who in the past have voted at a lower rate than men are now voting at roughly the same level These statistics also show that women whose political attitudes used to be barely distinguishable from those of men are beginning to take positions on issues that differ sharply from those taken by men These convergent developments are particularly significant in the view of political strategists and polltakers of both major parties because women have begun allying themselves more with Democratic positions Origins of the Shift Many public opinion experts believe that the partisan shift in the political views of women originated with distrust of President Reagan and a fear that he was too ready to risk a war Some believe that these attitudes may outlast the Reagan Administration in their effect on his party But others say there is no evidence that this is more than a temporary phenomenon that may vanish after Mr Reagan leaves office Both parties national chairmen acknowledge the potential significance of these developments Richard Richards for the Republicans said Were concerned about it but were going to do something about it He said his party would seek to reverse this movement by emphasizing President Reagans arms control stands and by recruiting women candidates Charles T Manatt the Democratic National Chairman said We are greatly encouraged by these trends He said his partys support for equality for women and their economic needs made him confident that women would remain a very important constituency for the Democratic Party Change in Voter Turnout The strategies they are plotting for this falls elections underscore the fact that even though the drive to ratify the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution will expire in failure tonight the importance of women in the electorate is increasing Women equaled men in the percentage of voter turnout in 1980 for the first time in peacetime reflecting the fact that voting by men has continued a longrange decline while the turnout of women has turned slightly upward after years of comparable declines a Census Bureau study has found In the future women are likely to vote in higher proportions than men according to the bureau even though both groups may continue to have relatively low turnouts Women under the age of 45 voted distinctly more heavily in 1980 than men in the same age group An analysis of all New York Times CBS News Polls conducted this year shows that women 18 to 44 years old were onethird more likely than men in that age group to call themselves Democrats They were also onefourth more likely to disapprove of how Mr Reagan was handling his job And three women to every five men chose the Republicans as the party most likely to make the right decisions about Social Security a key campaign issue this year The combined evidence of the Census Bureaus recent report Voting and Registration in the Election of November 1980 and the TimesCBS News Polls suggests that these patterns are persisting and may mark the beginning of a significant sex disparity in partisan voting trends in the United States Very Recent Differences These differences are of very recent origin Until the mid1970s polls have shown political opinions were basically undifferentiated by sex except that women were generally less receptive to the use of force in settling international disputes One typical view in Voters Choice a 1975 book by Gerald M Pomper a political scientist at Rutgers University was that there are no political differences between men and women that can be attributed to the factor of sex itself Although the census report found that more people had said they voted than had actually done so and although it acknowledges that shortcoming Robert M Teeter a Republican polltaker and other experts said it was clear that neither sex lied on this subject more than the other Mr Teeter said the reports evidence that women were now voting as heavily as men and that young women were voting more than young men was remarkable in its effect and largely unknown to political professionals One modest ray of hope for the Republicans is that men in the youngest part of the electorate those 18 to 24 years old seem distinctly more likely to call themselves Republican than are older men according to the polls In the very long run as Mr Teeter observed this group will replace older men who are heavily Democratic as voters and could tilt the electorate back if they retain partisanship as they grow older Fewer Young Men Voting But to translate that opportunity into a political reality Republicans must persuade those young men to vote Among those now 18 to 24 years old who were old enough to vote in 1980 according to the Census Bureau 375 percent of the 8346000 women and 353 percent of the 7919000 men reported that they had voted That added up to 3126000 women and 2796000 men Reversing that trend may prove difficult The report also indicated that among people now 25 to 44 women increased their lead over men in voting participation from 1976 to 1980 In that group the mens Republican leanings are less pronounced than those among younger men but the women are still solidly Democratic the polls show There are more women in every age bracket of the electorate and by about 1964 even though they were less likely than men to vote they cast more votes than men did As Richard M Scammon the elections expert observed They turn out a little bit more and there are more of them It adds up The census report says that 591 percent of men and 594 percent of women reported voting in 1980 The difference falls within the narrow margin of error of the study and is not statistically significant Higher Percentage of Women Jerry T Jennings the demographic statistician in the Census Bureaus population division who prepared the report said it was clear that by 1984 the percentage of women voting would exceed the percentage of men because women who attain voting age vote more frequently than do men in the same category and because these women replace older women with lower voting rates in the electorate The census report is based on interviews in 64000 households shortly after Election Day in 1980 This very large sample allows finer distinctions among small demographic groups such as men 18 to 24 years old than are possible in ordinary public opinion polls whose respondents rarely exceed 1500 The censuss methodology has been consistent since 1964 although the 1980 sample which included 19000 more homes than the 1976 study reduced the margin of sampling error Thus there is widespread acceptance for the conclusion that women whom the 1976 census report found trailing men 588 percent to 596 in turnout have caught up However some political scientists downgrade the value of the report although they do not argue with the general conclusion that women and men are now about equal in turnout percentages The critics say that because census interviewers not only ask individuals about their own voting but also solicit information about family members not present at the interview the precision of some of the smaller demographic measurements cannot be accepted LongTerm Decline Found Moreover the census study found the overreporting of votes cast Its national figure of 592 percent of those Americans 18 and over in 1980 is about 5 percentage points higher than most vote tallies indicate The report acknowledges that this is an overstatement like those found in other surveys The report has also found a longterm decline in the percentage of votingage Americans who actually vote though it suggests this may have leveled off in 1980 But this overreporting appears quite firmly to be divided equally among men and women John P Katosh a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan who has studied false reporting of voting to polltakers said his studies had found women at least as likely as men to report honestly about whether they voted The only other Presidential election in which the proportion of women voting exceeded that of men was in the wartime year 1944 when 12 million of the 42 million men over 21 were in the armed services That was an exception to a progression in which the percentage of women voting increased steadily This happened as more women who were eligible to vote when they turned 21 or 18 when that became the national voting age in 1972 entered the electorate and replaced those who had come of age before womens suffrage Recent studies have shown that as more women enter the labor force more of them vote Moreover increased education for women has made a dramatic difference in their voting rates with women who have as much education as men voting in about the same proportion The 1980 census study goes further indicating that women 25 to 54 who are high school graduates or attended college without graduating vote more heavily than their male contemporaries by at least 5 percentage points For those with college degrees or without high school diplomas the differences were insubstantial A Predictable Milestone Thus the attainment of equality in voting percentage was a predictable milestone But the sharp differences in political attitudes that give it such partisan significance were not The Pomper analysis reflected the results of most public opinion polls until the mid1970s As Patrick H Caddell the leading Democratic pollster whose first national client was George McGovern in 1972 put it Sex was a variable that it never paid to look at That may have been something of an exaggeration for in both the 1952 and the 1956 Presidential elections women gave Dwight D Eisenhower bigger majorities than men did according to postelection surveys by the Gallup Organization But from the 1960 through 1972 elections Gallup found no significant sex differences A similar postelection Gallup Poll for 1976 showed women preferring President Ford and men backing Jimmy Carter by slight margins in both cases while a CBS News Poll of voters leaving polling places showed no sex difference in the vote However the gender gap as the National Organization for Women calls the disparity in voting was a clear phenomenon in the 1980 Presidential election Women preferred Mr Reagan to President Carter by only 47 percent to 45 percent according to a TimesCBS News Poll conducted on Election Day while men gave the Republican nominee a margin of 55 percent to 36 percent Each sex gave John B Anderson the independent candidate 7 percent With the difference in their choice and their greater numbers women provided 58 percent of Mr Carters votes but just 49 percent of Mr Reagans Similar preferences were seen in some elections last fall and are projected in many 1982 preelection polls now being taken for both parties Some of the biggest disparities between men and women in the 18to44 age group turn up on distinctly partisan matters While 22 percent from each sex called themselves Republicans when interviewed in three TimesCBS News Polls this year 27 percent of the men and 36 percent of the women said they were Democrats The rest called themselves independents Data on Party Identification The difference between the 36 percent of women under 45 and the 27 percent of men in the 18to44 group who called themselves Democrats is more than double the margin of sampling error in the combined polls which is 4 percentage points The TimesCBS News data on party identification which go back to 1976 show that until the Reagan Administration men and women moved up and down in their party allegiances more or less in tandem Both sexes shifted away from Democratic identification and toward the Republicans in 1981 but women have now returned to approximately their 1980 preferences for Democrats Men however are more independent and less Democratic than they were in 1980 The net effect is a Democratic gain By another set of measurements women are clearly allying themselves to the Democrats From time to time TimesCBS News Polls inquire which party is best at handling particular problems In August 1980 for example when their party identification was about what it is now 35 percent of women said Republicans would be best at solving whatever they individually considered to be the nations most important problem Thirtytwo percent picked the Democrats In May 1982 35 percent picked the Democrats and 27 percent the Republicans Even greater shifts were recorded on several other major issuesOn unemployment for example women divided evenly in August 1980 and again in April 1981 But in May 1982 they preferred the Democrats by a wide margin 51 percent to 19 percent On the question of the parties ability to control inflation both men and women shifted toward the Democrats from April 1981 to May 1982 but the women shifted a bit more Last year men preferred the Republicans 50 percent to 16 percent this year their preference for Republicans was 42 percent to 31 percent Among women last year showed a Republican preference of from 41 percent to 17 percent this year women favored the Democrats 37 percent to 29 percent On the respective ability of the two parties to keep the country out of war both sexes narrowly picked the Democrats in August 1980 men by 40 percent to 33 percent and women by 34 percent to 30 percent In May 1982 the men were about unchanged favoring the Democrats by 41 percent to 31 percent Women shifted to a clear Democratic preference 41 percent to 25 percent Republican Edge on Spending On the parties ability to control government spending a traditional Republican strength in April 1981 women preferred Republicans over Democrats by 49 percent to 19 percent Thirteen months later in May 1982 the Republican edge was 39 percent to 33 percent The men in the May 1982 poll were consistently more supportive of the Republicans than were the women Fortytwo percent of the men said Republicans were better at controlling inflation for example while 31 percent preferred the Democrats Among women 37 percent said Democrats were better on inflation and 29 percent chose Republicans These sex differences were especially clear among people under 45 From unemployment to the military to controlling Federal spending to creating a budget that is fair to all people the women aged 18 to 44 were considerably more Democratic in their allegiances than were the men Mr Reagan himself produced several sexbased distinctions The total of the responses to the TimesCBS News Polls of January March and May showed men aged 18 to 44 approved his handling of the Presidency 54 percent to 34 Women divided almost equally with 44 percent approving and 43 percent disapproving And when asked in January and in May if they would vote for a Reagan supporter or an advocate of different policies for the House of Representatives the men aged 18 to 44 preferred Reagan backers 50 percent to 38 The women went the other way 51 percent to 39 On some issues such as abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment there were no significant differences between young women and young men in their stated preferences But most opinion analysts say these issues matter more to women than they do to men

EXCERPTS FROM A DEBATE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/07/nyregion/excerpts-from-a-debate-between-the-republican-candidates-for-governor.html,These are excerpts from a debate yesterday at the New York Times between Paul J Curran and Lewis E Lehrman Republican candidates for Governor of New York Crime Q On the crime issue what specifically would you do as GovernorCURRAN Im the only candidate in this years election  and if you go back in time I suppose the only one over a good while  whos had experience in the criminal justice area in fighting crime I was a Federal prosecutor for over five years and headed the SIC for over four The first thing we need to do and it has to be done very quickly by a new Governor is to put a death penalty on the books I would change immediately the method of jury selection in this state We have a method now where it takes days and days and weeks and months sometimes to pick a jury In the Federal system you pick a jury even in a complex case with many defendants in a day two days at the most That would free judges to try many more cases and that of course lessens plea bargaining I would revitalize the State Commission of Investigation and get it back to its mandate One of its mandates which is in the statute is to examine organized crime and report on it to the people LEHRMAN The police I believe are the principal deterrent on the streets of New York City on the streets of every city in the state of New York In 1977 for example there were approximately 6600 police officers on duty at any one moment in time in New York City Today there are approximately 6000 Weve had a 10 percent reduction in the number of police officers in New York City during a term of office in which we were promised a doubling of the police I think it is time for us in fact to expand police officers in every community which is preyed upon by violent criminals  whether it be New York City the downtowns of our major cities upstate or indeed in some of our suburban and rural communities as the case may be The Governor of the State of New York in the unified court system of approximately 1000 judges appoints 200 As Governor I would have the privilege of appointing five of seven judges to the Court of Appeals The Court of Appeals has made decisions in the past few years which have taken beyond their most liberal rulings decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States I speak specifically of right to counsel the suppression of evidence the suppression of confessions I believe that evidence that has been obtained in good faith by the police should be admissible in court Tax Cuts Q Mr Lehrman youve talked about a whole series of tax cuts that you think are needed for New York State What Id like to know is if you could identify the areas within the state government beyond the home relief cuts that youre proposing where the money for those tax cuts would come from LEHRMAN First I have proposed tax cuts coincident with the requirement under the Constitution of the State of New York for a balanced budget Each year the Governor is required to make a fiveyear forecast of his revenues For the next five years Hugh Carey has forecast a 1 billion increase in annual revenues under present law without any new tax increases to be passed Frankly I believe its the job of the Governor  as Ive said before publicly  to hold the line on public spending My belief is that a part of the 1 billion of increased revenues each year should be used to fund a gradual systematic reduction in tax rates on working New Yorkers and middle income New Yorkers New York State is no longer competitive 50 percent of all the businesses which left New York State in the 1970s went right next door  thats right they went to Pennsylvania New Jersey and Connecticut Now in order to keep jobs business capital and savings in New York State we have to have a competitive tax code We do not Over a period of eight years I have recommended a reform of the Tax Code of the State of New York in every significant respect CURRAN I have said consistently the goal of any Governor who comes into office next January is to try to cut taxes and cut spending insofar as possible The state income tax needs to be cut if it possibly can be cut but Mr Lehrman in the past has promised he would do that over eight years without regard to spending And thats where he and I I think part company on this issue I think when you really get in there and see those numbers youre going to have to do your utmost to cut There are many many things that have been mandated by the state over a period of time My point on this whole matter is that you cant possibly promise the people of New York a specific income tax cut over an eightyear time frame  and I think Mr Lehrman has now conceded this  unless you know what the revenues are going to be and unless youre prepared to look at exactly what programs youre going to make substantial savings in Q What would you go for to save money CURRAN I would try my utmost and I think it would do it to cut most every agency of government monies and other expenditures which they are undergoing annually And I think that can be done Ive done it in the past LEHRMAN Ive made two concrete proposals as you know First in the area of New York State welfare Mental Health Q Home relief right LEHRMAN Yes and I think that there are substantial areas for equitable fair and humane applications of costsaving techniques Secondly Ive discussed the problem of mental institutions in the state of New York Specifically in 1955 I believe there were about 93000 patients in our mental institutions in the state of New York Today it is estimated that there are approximately 21000 patients in our mental institutions Its interesting that the patient load of our mental institutions has declined by approximately 75 to 80 percent but the budget for these institutions has tripled Since 1972 there has not been a single staff reduction to my knowledge on the basis of the research weve been able to do in the mental institutions of the state of New York And therefore I believe it is a vast amount of reform possibility in the mental institutions of the state of New York Governor Carey has recognized that as have Republican Assemblymen and Senators They have recognized the waste and the misallocation of resources in our mental institutions by proposing their conversion to prisons in certain cases  for example in Gowanda the Gowanda mental institution in Erie County the proposal for conversion in Suffolk County of Pilgrim Center Q Which you oppose LEHRMAN Indeed Q Why do you oppose that if you want to save money LEHRMAN I have in fact endorsed the conversion of the Gowanda center in Erie County as you know I have objected to the conversion in Suffolk County for a very specific reason I do not believe that you can divide on a single property an institution into two principal public purposes I do not believe that you can have aged mentally infirm inmates of a mental institution side by side with violent felons in a prison  and that is exactly what Governor Carey has proposed for Pilgrim Center CURRAN I think that all the candidates  in terms of conversion I think all the candidates  at least as far as Ive read  have opposed the conversion of Pilgrim State LEHRMAN You do oppose it Im on record opposing it primarily because its a residential area and the residences are practically in the facility or right around the facility and I dont think it makes any sense at this point to do that Q Do you have any problems with the basic philosophy of converting a mental hospital into a prison if some of these other qualifications are met CURRAN No I have believed for a good while that that can and should be done I think the Governor and the Legislature have to look at the overall state picture and pick the places that are going to be best School Funding Q The Court of Appeals has ruled that the state has no obligation to equalize spending between rich and poor school districts Does either of you gentlemen believe that the state even though the court has not ruled has an obligation to do some equalizing of the spending CURRAN I think the state has an obligation to try to see to it that spending is equal to some extent I think the Court of Appeals decision was a sound one because it reaffirmed the notion of local control over education which has been good in this state One of the things I have a great deal of trouble with  its language in the Court of Appeals decision  is that quality education is almost always assessed as strict dollars I think thats a fallacy to some extent Q Would you be willing to at least consider a formula that involved cuts in state aid to some communities CURRAN Well I think if you redo an education formula along the lines Ive suggested youre probably going to have a result where some communities are going to end up getting some more per student and some are going to be getting some less Q But as a narrow question you are not willing to say whether youd cut aid to wealthy school districts LEHRMAN I dont think it has to be done you see I think economic growth in fact is the alternative Equal Rights Abortions Q How about short answers on two divisive questions One is a statewide equal rights amendment where do you stand And also Medicaid financing for abortions CURRAN Let me answer the second one first Im opposed to the use of taxpayers money to fund abortions on request or on demand Q And then on a statewide equal rights amendment CURRAN As far as I know we have all the statutes on the books in New York now mandating equal rights And I think the present situation is appropriate We have them Equal rights are mandated now under all kinds of statutes LEHRMAN I dont believe taxpayers should be forced to subsidize unrestricted abortion on demand On a statewide ERA I mean in principle I understand its purpose One of the practical problems is that it would take at least three years to get a state ERA It might even take substantially longer Court of Appeals Q What do you think of the present court CURRAN I have a problem with some of the Court of Appeals decisions in the Criminal Justice area Indeed the Court of Appeals was very recently reversed as you know by the United States Supreme Court in the child pornography area where they went one way and struck down a statute in New York in effect struck down a statute and the United States Supreme Court said they were wrong I think theyve gotten too bogged down in some cases in technicalities and not looked sufficiently at the issues of guilt or innocence and found a way to uphold convictions rather than to reverse them LEHRMAN I think that the Supreme Court decision on appeal of the pornographic use of children in movies or otherwise is a perfect example of the excess to which the Appeals Court of the State of New York has carried procedural technicalities to the point whereby they have endangered the public safety of the community But this is not a unique case Though it is true that the Supreme Court of the United States has overruled a Court of Appeals on the pornography issue it is equally true that because of decisions of the Court of Appeals taken I believe in good conscience but wrongly confessions de facto have been made virtually inadmissible in certain criminal trials in the state courts of New York Evidence which has been obtained in good faith by policemen in the performance of their duties has been suppressed such that violent felons cannot be effectively prosecuted Public Service Commission Q Does either of you have specific ideas as to how this Public Service Commission should act with regard to utilities CURRAN My sense is that the Public Service Commission has a tough time keeping up with the increases because they come in so fast They are applying for one increase before theyve had a ruling on the prior one in some situations I dont have any today certainly any panacea for that situation I think what one would need to do as Governor is appoint to the Public Service Commission people who are steadfastly committed to seeing to it that utilty costs are held down insofar as possible LEHRMAN If the PSC can be criticized for anything I think one of the problems is that it is insufficiently businesslike I cite for example the Shoreham nuclear power project on Long Island which represents a construction project absolutely out of control by every significant judgment of cost overrun I refer to Nine Mile Point in Oswego which was proposed at a cost of 300 millions of dollars and now may cost over three billions some have suggested even more Now that raises the question whether or not these private monopolies are in fact being well managed I have my doubts Westway Q Where are you on Westway CURRAN Im for Westway LEHRMAN Im opposed to Westway Q Why LEHRMAN Im opposed to Westway because Im for building a West Side Highway Im opposed to Westway because what could easily be a 4 billion project paid for by the taxpayer could be a 500 million efficient highway constructed properly CURRAN Let me speak to that I agree with Lew on one proposition The politicians have kicked this around too long That litigation should have been fought years ago This has been approved by the Congress I think in 76 or thereabouts Tuition Tax Credits Q Do you see any state obligation to private parochial elementary and secondary schoolsLEHRMAN Im for tuition tax credits at both the Federal and state level CURRAN I would be for tuition tax credits There have been bills in Albany at the state level And I think that that makes sense Its not a very large amount but it would be some help Governor Carey Q What do you think of Governor Carey Hows he done CURRAN Well I think particularly the last four years Governor Carey has not done his job as Governor the way he should I think he hasnt worked with the Legislature which a governor must do Youve got to confront the Legislature when its necessary in the public interest But Ive been in Albany I understand the process a little bit I dont know whether anybody understands it totally  but you have to work very hard with the Legislature The Legislature this year as far as I can tell has been substantially running the state whether its the budget or anything else And Democrats and Republicans get together and try to agree on programs LEHRMAN To some extent I concur The Governor has not given the Legislature the strong leadership it needs The absense of the Governors strong leadership is in fact I believe the principal reason for the budget impasse of the past two years I dont believe that Governor Carey has been an allout fulltime working Governor during the last couple of years On the other hand I believe he did a good job during the financial crisis of New York City immediately after his election during the first term I believe he started the program of gradual tax reductions in New York State State vs City Q Do you think right now that the state is fairly treating New York City LEHRMAN Yes CURRAN I think that on the whole New York City is treated fairly by Albany yes
"G.O.P. RIVALS, IN DEBATE, FAULT APPEALS COURT; Excerpts from the debate, B5",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/07/nyregion/gop-rivals-in-debate-fault-appeals-court-excerpts-from-the-debate-b5.html,In their first confrontation in the contest for the Republican nomination for governor Paul J Curran and Lewis E Lehrman yesterday both criticized the states highest court the Court of Appeals as too liberal and too lenient on the subject of the rights of defendants I think theyve gotten too bogged down in some cases in technicalities and not looked sufficiently at the issues of guilt or innocence and found a new way to uphold convictions rather than to reverse them said Mr Curran a former Federal prosecutor What has happened in the state courts in New York Mr Lehrman said is that things like the exclusionary rule have been applied beyond the wildest and extreme rulings that could ever have been imagined from earlier Federal court rulings on evidence that should be excluded from trials It was the sharpest criticism of the Court of Appeals by majorparty gubernatorial candidates in many years and was particularly significant because the terms of five of the seven judges will expire during the next gubernatorial term Issue of Innocence or Guilt Both candidates said that their Court of Appeals appointees would be toughminded in Mr Currans words or in Mr Lehrmans words judges who believe that a trial of a felon is for the purpose of determining the innocence or guilt of the accused more than it should be turned into an inquisition into the propriety of a policemans conduct The two candidates agreed more than they disagreed on a wide variety of issues during a 90minute discussion with New York Times reporters There were some pointed exchanges but they stopped short of sharp attacks on each other in the first of what is likely to be a series of debates before the Sept 23 Republican primary Among the areas in which they agreed were these  Both applauded the Court of Appealss reversal of the socalled Levittown decision In reversing the decision by a lower court the Court of Appeals ruled that the state is not obliged to equalize property taxes for school spending and that any equalizing should be left to the executive and legislative branches Mr Curran said he favored a revision of current school aid formulas Mr Lehrman said a general economic upturn would help equalize property tax revenues between school districts  Both opposed public financing of abortions  Both questioned the need for a state constitutional amendment on equal rights for women Both said that the appointment of a woman to the states highest court would be desirable but stopped short of any commitment  Both favored the death penalty  Both favored President Reagans proposal for a third year of Federal income tax cuts  Both supported Federal and state tuition tax credits for private and parochial school students  Both said that New York City was receiving its fair share of state aid Disagreement on Economy Their strongest disagreements came in the economic area with Mr Curran saying some of Mr Lehrmans proposals for tax cuts and economic expansion were unrealistic Mr Lehrman whose family built a grocery store into the Rite Aid drug chain said that he favored a gradual systematic tax reduction to make the state more competitive with its neighbors including Pennsylvania where Rite Aid still has its headquarters Fifty percent of all the businesses that left New York State in the 1970s went right next door  thats right they went to Pennsylvania New Jersey and Connecticut Mr Lehrman said He added that his tax reduction proposal was contingent upon a balanced state budget and a growing economy Mr Curran seized on that to declare that Mr Lehrman had previously not qualified his taxcut proposal The state income tax needs to be cut if it possibly can be cut Mr Curran said but Mr Lehrman in the past has promised he would do that over eight years without regard to spending  and thats where he and I I think part company on this issue They also parted company on the Westway with Mr Curran favoring the superhighway and Mr Lehrman opposing it and calling for a tradein of some of the Federal highway funds for mass transit Noting the Federal deficit Mr Curran said that talk of exchanging the funds was absurd
SUMMARY OF MAJOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY NEW YORK LEGISLATURE IN 1982 SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/09/nyregion/summary-of-major-actions-taken-by-new-york-legislature-in-1982-session.html,Following are some of the major actions of the State Legislature in its 1982 session which recessed Saturday Many of the bills approved in its closing days still await action by Governor Carey Finance Governor Carey and the Legislature fought over the size of the budget for most of the session Mr Carey argued that the Legislature was spending beyond the states means and called for tax increases But the legislative leaders said that Mr Carey was underestimating state revenues and that tax increases were unnecessary After negotiations between Mr Carey and the leaders broke down the Legislature passed a budget of its own and Mr Carey vetoed more than 900 million in appropriations The Legislature did not override those vetoes but restored most of the spending later in a series of separate bills Mr Carey vetoed most of this spending but the Legislature in its closing days overrode the Governors vetoes The states 27 billion budget includes money from state sources and from such outside sources as Federal aid It was the first full budget to be enacted under a new law requiring the Legislature to approve the way the state disburses Federal funds The budget contained 44 billion in aid to the states elementary and secondary schools 310 million more than last year The Legislature rejected Mr Careys proposal to raise the sales tax a penny to provide 27 billion in new aid over the next five years as a way of equalizing spending between rich and poor school districts The Legislature approved a oneyear partial state takeover of the local costs of Medicaid The measure which takes effect next year will provide 359 million in local aid with New York City getting twothirds of the money The Legislature rejected Mr Careys broader Medicaid takeover proposal Over the Governors objections the Legislature passed an 80 million aid program for upstate localities The new state budget includes substantial sums for criminaljustice programs including 70 million for prison construction 12 million for a program to deal with career criminals 3 million for parole programs and 35 million for a subway crime strike force The state completed its 35 billion sale of shortterm notes at an interest rate of 8385 percent the lowest rate since 1979 Reapportionment The Legislature enacted new boundaries for the states Congressional State Senate and Assembly districts after more than nine months of acrimonious bargaining The Legislatures initial redistricting plan was rejected by the Justice Department which ruled that the proposal discriminated against minorities in Brooklyn Manhattan and the Bronx But the Legislatures subsequent plan was accepted Because of the delay the Legislature moved the states primary date to Sept 23 from Sept 14 The new plan reduces the state Congressional

ANATOMY OF THE NUCLEAR PROTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/11/magazine/anatomy-of-the-nuclear-protest.html,Fox Butterfield is chief of The New York Times bureau in Boston Randall Forsberg was born in Alabama with a few Georgia plantations ravaged by Shermans troops floating around in my past She graduated from Barnard College in the mid1960s and became an English teacher at the proper Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr Pa There was little in her background to suggest that one day she would produce the idea that has turned the esoteric art of nucleararms control into an explosive popular issue Alan F Kay graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology served in Army intelligence during World War II and got a PhD in math at Harvard He founded and eventually sold two highly profitable electronics companies one of which worked for the Pentagon before retiring to his home in Weston a greencarpeted expanse of multiacre houses that is Bostons wealthiest suburb There was little in his biography to suggest that he would provide the first key infusion of cash that enabled Miss Forsberg to translate her potent idea into action It was in 1980 that the retired businessman heard the former schoolteacher now a student of the arms race make her proposal She was calling for a freeze  a mutual and verifiable freeze by the United States and the Soviet Union on the testing production and deployment of all nuclear weapons It was a very simple idea  too simple some critics contended since it did not allow for the staggering complexities of the arms race But Mr Kay recognized that its simplicity could also be a strength It sidestepped the old hardtounderstand arguments about MIRVs megatonnage throw weight and inspection that had long baffled the public So Mr Kay contributed the money that set the freeze campaign in motion  5000 to help organize the first national conference of peace groups in Washington in March 1981 where it was decided to concentrate on promoting the freeze as a common strategy He would eventually add a quarter of a million dollars spread among several antinuclearwar groups In the year since that first meeting the freeze idea has reached what some activists like to call critical mass borrowing from the lexicon of atomic physics A poll last spring by The New York Times and CBS News found that 72 percent of Americans favor a nuclear freeze It has been endorsed by hundreds of town meetings dozens of city councils and nine state legislatures Last month it was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a nonbinding resolution The freeze idea has provided a spark but it is only part of a larger story an extraordinary grassroots nationwide movement to stop the nuclear arms race The movement has even influenced President Reagan leading him to soften his longtime opposition to armscontrol talks and inspiring him to offer several sweeping proposals to negotiate sharp reductions in nuclear arsenals with the Soviet Union The movements scope was dramatically illustrated by last months disarmament rally in New York City in which an estimated 700000 people participated making it the largest political demonstration in the history of the United States And there are a growing number of politicians in Washington who believe the antinuclear arms issue may play an important role in this Novembers Congressional elections and the 1984 Presidential contest Two weeks after the New York rally the Democratic Party at its midterm convention in Philadelphia endorsed a carefully worded freeze resolution that had been drafted by aides to the partys leading Presidential contenders The profile of this latest of protests is a far cry from that of the powerful antiwar demonstrations of the late 1960s The leaders are not bearded radicals but middleaged and middleclass men and women many accustomed to positions of responsibility and prestige They include doctors lawyers nurses scientists teachers and priests Their chief battles have been fought not in street confrontations but at sermons and lectures in books and pamphlets The history of the new movement offers special insights into the American political process and the state of the public mind and character It also suggests how disparate ideas and people can be successfully joined given good timing a willingness to learn the hard lessons of modern political organizing and the presence of a powerful catalyst In this case the catalyst was a President whose continuous preaching about the need for a massive buildup of American nuclear forces aroused the fears of an already anxious nation The anxiety began with the scientists who built the bomb and then sought to place it under international controls It surfaced publicly in the late 1950s and early 60s with the controversy over fallout from nuclear testing in the atmosphere And it reappeared in the late 60s with public worry over the Pentagons plans to build an antiballistic missile system in heavily populated areas These movements faded once they seemed to achieve their objectives but they left a heritage of fear about nuclear peril In 1978 a small peace group the Institute for World Order commissioned Yankelovich Skelly and White the polling organization to study why more people dont join peace groups Yankelovichs conclusion was that there was both widespread ignorance about what nuclear weapons do and deep latent concern about them They became very interested in the problem and began talking about where can we sign up to stop this madness recalled Greg Martire a vice president of the Yankelovich organization They were not unaware of the dangers of nuclear war but they had felt it was beyond their control Based on this study and another Yankelovich did in 1980 for a second peace group the polling organization predicted that many people would join up if the issue was explained to them in understandable terms and if they could be shown how they could be effective Today speaking of the sudden growth of the antinucleararms movement Mr Martire says It doesnt surprise me When we wrote those reports two years ago it was clear the potential was there Bernard T Feld is a 62yearold professor of physics at MIT His gentle manner broad head and shoulderlength graying hair give him a resemblance to Einstein Sitting in his sunlit office he recalled his early career as an assistant to both Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard he took part in producing the initial chain reaction at the University of Chicago in 1942 I was involved in the original sin he said and I have spent a large part of the rest of my life atoning Soon after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August l945 Mr Feld left his Government research job to push for the creation in Washington of a civilian nuclear agency He also helped establish the Federation of American Scientists originally named the Federation of Atomic Scientists the first group dedicated to controlling nuclear weapons Another MIT scientist who participated in both the development of military hardware and arms control is Jerome B Wiesner who was president of the Cambridge school from 1971 to 1980 A pioneer in radar he began his efforts to slow down the arms race in 1957 after President Eisenhower asked him to start work on civil defense and then design a system to measure Soviet compliance with a nucleartest moratorium I became convinced we were running an arms race with ourselves the craggyfaced grayhaired Mr Wiesner said The big inventions of the arms race have all been ours the Abomb the Hbomb intercontinental missiles solid fuel rockets highaccuracy guidance systems for missiles MIRVs multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles cruise missiles In 1961 Mr Wiesner was named President Kennedys science adviser and proceeded to urge the President to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty with the Russians There was a lot of public pressure at the time with womens groups picketing in front of the White House every day Mr Wiesner remembered People were very upset about strontium 90 in their milk it was something tangible not just some vague fear about what might happen in the future Occasionally when Id go into the Presidents office hed say Your women are out there again  But President Kennedys talks with the Russians on a comprehensive treaty that would have barred testing underground as well as in the atmosphere foundered on the number of annual onsite inspections each side would accept The United States demanded seven the Russians would permit only three In the end at Nikita Khrushchevs initiative Mr Wiesner said the two sides agreed to settle for an accord prohibiting tests in the atmosphere dropping the stickier issue of underground experiments Mr Wiesner now feels there was a great opportunity lost in 1963 If a comprehensive test ban treaty had been signed it would have been more significant than SALT in arresting things At the time we knew our weapons were considerably better than those of the Russians Henry W Kendall yet another MIT physicist and onetime consultant to the Defense Department helped found the Union of Concerned Scientists in 1969 to lead the battle against the ABM He was elated when he won that struggle but increasingly frustrated as he watched public interest in disarmament decline while the weapons race intensified As Professor Kendall a softspoken man dressed in an old dark gray wool suit and moccasins analyzed the situation the average citizen was put off by the forbidding complexity of nuclear arms They have been hidden behind the combined shroud of technology and national security During the 1970s his organization with headquarters in Harvard Square switched its focus to the then more popular issue of nuclear power The Union of Concerned Scientists grew rapidly and by the time of the serious accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979 the group had 100000 contributors But Professor Kendall was dissatisfied The dangers of nuclear power are so small compared with nuclear war he explained it seemed to me like a tangential issue So in 1980 he pushed to return the organization to its original purpose nucleararms control His timing was excellent The real hardline voice about nuclear weapons had emerged and started to really scare people he said There was Reagan talking about fighting and winning a limited nuclear war and handing out his laundry list of building up every conceivable nuclear weapon because he claimed we were behind the Russians It brought out the latent anxiety Basing its strategy on one of the Yankelovich studies the Union of Concerned Scientists set about organizing a series of teachins at what the group thought would be two dozen colleges last Nov 11 Veterans Day Eventually 150 schools participated We hit a nerve a professor at the University of Texas said afterward And this is Texas not the Northeast The Veterans Day events proved an important turning point attracting widespread attention in the press and from television focusing still more public interest on the issue While Professor Kendall in Cambridge was trying to reorient the Union of Concerned Scientists back to nuclear war Dr Bernard Lown was part of a similar attempt across the Charles River in Boston  with a group he had started in his living room in 1961 Physicians flr Social Responsibility One of the worlds most distinguished cardiologists and a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health Dr Lown had pioneered the use of coronarycare units and much of the technology to help prevent sudden death from heart attack An intense articulate and precise man he became concerned about the arms race after hearing a lecture on nuclear holocaust in 1959 He proceeded to organize a group of fellow physicians and to publish a series of papers on the medical consequences of thermonuclear war in the New England Journal of Medicine one of the countrys leading medical bulletins in 1962 It remains the classic work on the total inadequacy of any medical response in an American city hit by a nuclear bomb After the partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963 however the physicians group atrophied Seated in the woodpanneled Harvard Club in Bostons Back Bay section Dr Lown recalled that the organization was not really revived until 1980 when Mr Reagans campaign rhetoric rekindled the old fears Dr Lown calculated that doctors might accomplish what the physicists had never been able to do  arouse the public After all he said if you have a serious problem where do you go In a secular age the doctor has become priest rabbi counselor Then too the doctor brings all the credentials of a scientist One of the key new activists in the Physicians for Social Responsibility was Dr Helen M Caldicott an outspoken Australianborn pediatrician She had been passionately involved in the antinuclear movement since she read the novel On the Beach as a teenager in Melbourne The book set in Australia describes the end of the world in a nuclear war She became president of the group in 1979 and resigned her practice and a teaching job at the Harvard Medical School Since then Dr Caldicott who is 43 years old has toured the country showing the film The Last Epidemic which describes in chilling detail exactly what would happen to San Francisco in a nuclear attack She sees her work as a logical extension of the practice of medicine It is the ultimate form of preventive medicine If you have a disease and there is no cure for it you work on prevention The Physicians for Social Responsibility has increased its membership from 3000 a year ago to 16000 today Thomas A Halsted the groups director who once worked for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under the Carter Administration says that it is now gaining more than 300 new adherents a week The doctors main organizational tactic until recently has been their careful field work conducting daylong educational symposiums for groups of 1500 to 3000 doctors in a dozen cities around the country But PSR as it is called has also begun adopting directmail appeals This year the physicians group will only send out about one million letters Mr Halsted said as many as a million at a time are sent out by some of the more sophisticated political action committees in Washington The organization has been getting back about 4 for every 1 it spends on its new mailings he added And its own budget has increased from 400000 last year to about 16 million this year Its staff of 24 fulltime employees has just moved to new quarters above a Woolworths store in Cambridge and has opened another small office in Washington To aid its work the group has acquired its own computer and also rents time on a bigger computer system at Harvard The success of the scientists and doctors groups has been shared by dozens of other such organizations including High Technology Professionals for Peace Communicators for Nuclear Disarmament Educators for Social Responsibility and Musicians Against Nuclear Arms Alan Sherr who is president of the Lawyers Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control believes that organizing by guild has been essential to the movements success Mr Sherr quit his job as general counsel to the Massachusetts Office of Human Services last January to open a fulltime office for the lawyers group his new office looks out over Bostons Granary Burial Ground where Paul Revere and Sam Adams are among those interred The guild approach he said avoids the divisiveness of the Vietnam War protests a key factor in convincing older conservative professionals to join the movement During the 1960s such men and women had no desire to be associated with the hippies and the flagburning that were so prominent in the peace movement of that day Their feelings are different toward telephone calls or letters from their peers Another important factor in convincing middleclass and middleaged citizens to join the movement have been American churches  particularly the Roman Catholic Church which has experienced a critical transformation According to Bishop Thomas J Gumbleton Roman Catholic auxiliary Bishop of Detroit the change began during the Vietnam War though not many Bishops publicly identified with it at the time In 1968 he recalled the National Conference of Catholic Bishops had written a pastoral letter outlining the possibility of a conflict between a persons conscience and what the Government asks you to do This Bishop Gumbleton said highlighted a problem that had been there for many Catholics We had a heritage as an immigrant church We tended to overcompensate for this by our patriotism As Francis Cardinal Spellman used to say My country right or wrong  But as the Vietnam War continued the bishops began to reexamine the old arguments concerning a just war And as Bishop Gumbleton pointed out the churchs reevaluation of the relationship between the individual and the state intensified with the Supreme Court decision allowing abortion in 1973 In November 1980 with the collapse of the SALT II treaty and Mr Reagans campaign rhetoric about the need to increase Americas nuclear arsenal the Catholic bishops conference began work on a pastoral letter on the arms race It is due to be issued this fall Bishop Gumbleton who is head of the American branch of Pax Christi a Roman Catholic peace group would not comment on its contents But he referred to a statement made last year by Archbishop John R Roach president of the bishops conference in which he proclaimed that the most dangerous moral issue in the public order confronting us is the arms race The nuclear freeze has been endorsed by 133 of the nations 280 active Roman Catholic bishops An important facet of the peace movement has been the degree to which Boston and Cambridge have been its breeding ground With the exception of Ground Zero in Washington and the church organizations most of the major antinuclearwar groups have their headquarters in the Boston area or started there including the freeze campaign itself That is a traditional role for an area that has long been a center of liberal political thought and activity And Bernard Feld of MIT offers another explanation He talks about the criticalmass effect We have so many universities around here that people dont feel isolated and can talk to each other without feeling strange For Randall Forsberg though the transformation from privateschool teacher to peace activist began elsewhere It was in 1967 at the height of the Vietnam War that Miss Forsberg married a young Swedish student and moved to Stockholm The Swedish Government had decided one contribution it could make to world peace would be to monitor the arms race So in 1966 it had established the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Because the organizers wanted an international staff Miss Forsberg was able to walk in off the street and get a job as a typist The institute was organized with the stated goal of providing independent analysis of the United StatesSoviet balance of power Within the last year it has become a target of criticism accused of issuing findings that tend to favor the Soviet point of view Miss Forsbergs introduction to the complexity of the nuclearweapons race came when she began reading what she was typing She couldnt believe that the 1963 talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty had broken down over the dispute between Washingtons demand for seven onsite inspections a year and the Russians limit of three Why not compromise on five she wondered Soon she was writing her own research papers on the arms race In 1974 divorced and the mother of a 5yearold daughter Miss Forsberg moved to Boston where she started graduate work in arms control at MIT A few years later she set up her own small agency the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies in suburban Brookline Miss Forsberg describes how she arrived at her freeze proposal I came to the conclusion that after the failure of the comprehensive test ban talks in 1963 the armsconrol experts gave up on complete disarmament even on substantial reductions in nuclear and conventional forces What replaced it was the idea of managing a permanent arms race the goal being to keep things relatively equal The buzz word was stability to avoid destabilizing weapons Then when President Reagan began talking about a 240 billion buildup in MX missiles cruise missiles and Trident submarines she became convinced that the United States was giving up even this limited goal The answer Miss Forsberg felt was an idea that would be simple enough to involve the public and that would actually lead to reductions in nuclear stockpiles and stop the introduction of ever newer more lethal weapons  the mutual and verifiable freeze And that would be equitable she felt because she was convinced as are many supporters of the freeze today that the United States nuclear arsenal is at least the equal of the Soviet arsenal notwithstanding President Reagans claims to the contrary Miss Forsberg herself believes the freeze idea has been the single most important factor in the sudden growth of the movement over the past year She and other activists cite several additional key factors that have stimulated the movement the Senates failure to ratify the 1979 SALT II Treaty limiting strategic offensive nuclear weapons President Reagans talk about fighting and surviving a limited nuclear war and the Reagan Administrations push for a vastly increased Pentagon budget at a time when the economy is in recession Each of these increased anxiety to the point where for many people Miss Forsberg feels curbing the arms race no longer seemed a partisan political issue She does not however believe the explosion of the peace movement in Europe over the last two years has been important for its American counterpart The Europeans are reacting to a very specific problem she said They dont want new American nuclear weapons deployed in their backyards making them a target for the Russians But this is not the issue for Americans they arent particularly concerned about what the Western Europeans are feeling Yet as the American public has awakened to the antinuclearweapons question each new event has added to the movements momentum like the publication in The New Yorker of Jonathan Schells series which has now become a bestselling book The Fate of the Earth In California Harold Willens a Los Angeles millionaire has led a drive which got more than 700000 signatures far more than needed to put the freeze on the states November ballot And during one week in April Ground Zero got a million Americans to watch films listen to debates or circulate petitions in 650 towns and cities 350 colleges and more than 1200 high schools Where is the movement headed Democratic and Republican politicians agree that the antinuclear campaign is becoming far more partisan and political They disagree about how significant a role it will play this fall and in the 1984 elections Patrick H Caddell the Carter Administrations pollster said the mammoth rally in New York tended to confirm his conviction that the antinucleararms movement is the most significant movement since the environmental movement in the late 1960s In Mr Caddells view the disarmament issue may not come to a head until after November but he sees it as a longterm movement that is bound to have a strong political impact On the other hand Lance Tarrance Jr a pollster in Houston who works mainly for Republicans discounts the surveys which indicate that threequarters of the American people favor a freeze When his interviewers go on to ask people if they want a freeze that would leave the United States militarily behind the Soviet Union many people fall off the bandwagon he said Support for the freeze is not firm it wont hold up under stress But the movement has clearly had an impact on President Reagan affecting his policy if not his personal thinking The first significant change took place back in November not long after the widespread teachins on Veterans Day when he proposed to the Soviet leader Leonid I Brezhnev that Washington would forgo placing its new Pershing 2 and cruise missiles on European soil if Moscow would scrap its SS20 missiles already targeted on Western Europe Mr Reagan appeared to be trying to outflank the burgeoning antinucleararms movement by being conciliatory instead of combative Then last month he signaled a major switch away from his hardline policy of linking arms control talks with Soviet aggression around the world In a commencement speech at Eureka College in Illinois he proposed a twostep plan in which the United States and the Soviet Union would initially reduce by onethird their inventories of nuclear warheads on land and seabased ballistic missiles Yet many peace activists remain skeptical about Mr Reagans sincerity in wanting nucleararms control At the same time he was making his latest offer to Moscow the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Caspar W Weinberger was drafting a fiveyear plan for fighting nuclear war against the Soviet Union over a prolonged period It has also not gone unnoticed that Mr Reagans choice to head the United States delegation to the new talks on reducing strategic arms which began in Geneva on June 29 is a conservative retired Army lieutenant general Edward L Rowny General Rowny who resigned from the American SALT II negotiating team to protest what he felt were too great concessions by the Carter Administration to the Soviet Union has charged that a freeze would lock the United States into an inferior position Despite the rapid spread of the antinucleararms movement there is still far from a consensus about how the United States should proceed or whether the freeze proposal itself is a good plan More than 25 different resolutions to end the arms race have been introduced in Congress and a freeze resolution was rejected by the Republicancontrolled Senate Foreign Relations Committee Even some of the most active members of the movement worry that the freeze is too simplistic and impractical Roger C Molander the founder of Ground Zero and a former National Security Council staff member asks Freeze what Does it mean freezing every last vehicle that is rigged up to deliver nuclear weapons like the A6s on aircraft carriers The freeze campaign is a good way for people to express their concern about the dangers of nuclear war he continues but the lesson we can learn from the last 20 years is that focusing exclusively on armscontrol agreements or the development of new weapons is not enough The hard thing to face up to is that you cant get real arms control without improving relations with the Soviet Union Mr Molander is concerned that Americans are deceiving themselves by concentrating only on affecting United States Government policy There is a little too much of the feeling that the whole problem is in this country and that if we can just get our act together the Russians will go along But many of the activists are heartened by their sudden success particularly as seen in the huge New York rally Joan Baez the folk singer and a leader of civilrights and antiVietnam War protests of the 1960s remarked in New York I have been on peace marches since I was probably 14 years old But never in all those years did I feel the kind of encouragement I do now Dr James Muller secretary of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and an assistant professor of cardiology at the Harvard Medical School was euphoric after the big rally It was far more people than we expected he said Representative Edward J Markey Democrat of Massachusetts one of the original sponsors of the freeze resolution in the House is also optimistic A tall lanky youthfullooking man of 36 with modishly long brown hair and clear blue eyes Mr Markey believes that freeze workers are going to be the replacements this fall for the Moral Majority in the 1980 election They may provide the margin in close contests and make them flipflop perhaps 20 to 30 seats My belief Mr Markey added is that Reagan was not put on earth by God to bring us supplyside economics His role is to sit down with Brezhnev and end the arms race to do for nuclear arms what Nixon did for China My role is to create the atmospherics the public and Congressional support that will make Reagan the greatest man who ever lived Mr Markey paused then went on with a smile He can reject it of course but we will have tried

CINCINNATI BISHOP WILL SUCCEED CODY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/11/us/cincinnati-bishop-will-succeed-cody.html,Pope John Paul II named Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Cincinnati yesterday to succeed the late John Cardinal Cody as head of the nations largest see the Archdiocese of Chicago No date for the installation was announced The temporary head of the archdiocese the Very Rev John R Keating hailed the choice and appealed to Chicagos Roman Catholics to help your chosen servant Joseph to watch over your flock Father Keating took over the post after Cardinal Cody died April 25 at the age of 74 Archbishop Bernardins high esteem among fellow bishops is reflected in the many high posts for which they have selected him including a threeyear term as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops He was also given the sensitive and complex chairmanship of the bishops committee to draft a policy statement on nuclear arms for debate at the annual meeting of the hierarchy in November His move to Chicago places him in one of the most visible and powerful positions in the Roman Catholic Church By tradition the Archbishop of Chicago is elevated to the rank of cardinal in due course Speculation on Appointment The appointment ended intense speculation that arose before and after Cardinal Codys death because of allegations that he had improperly diverted church funds for his personal use Some people familiar with the situation had said they believed the inquiry might prompt the Vatican to replace Cardinal Cody before he reached the normal mandatory retirement age of 75 Archbishop Bernardin had often been named as a possible successor long before the cardinals death Last Tuesday United States Attorney Dan Webb who oversaw a grand jury investigation of the charges announced that the case had been closed and that no indictments would be issued But even though the formal investigation has ended the climate of turmoil left by the charges and by 17 years of Cardinal Codys rule pose formidable financial and morale problems for the new leader of the 25 million Roman Catholics who live in the archdiocese Among the chief complaints of critics of Cardinal Cody was that he acted autocratically and suppressed many of the progressive reforms for which the archdiocese had been noted The archdiocese was repeatedly racked by disputes between the cardinal and those who rebelled against his policies Archbishop Bernardin who is 54 years old has been a candidate preferred for the post by many Catholics who say they believe his extensive background in national and global church affairs and his calming temperament equip him to lead the archdiocese in a more tranquil and constructive direction More Open Leadership He is known as a leader who shuns pomp and ardently believes in social justice He is also known for his practice of widespread consultation with priests and the laity in reaching decisions that affect his archdiocese Chicago Catholics who advocate a more open form of leadership in their archciocese have often pointed to such qualities as essential to restoring confidence and enthusiasm In exercising authority he has gained a reputation for clear smooth direction though his selfeffacing and reticent manner sometimes deflects his ability to display firm confident conduct of church business Archbishop Bernardin has frequently spoken of the need for the church to reach out more effectively to a society that is more secular and pluralistic He has also urged fuller discussion on matters of dispute within the church In an interview he once defined the prime traits needed for a contemporary bishop as sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of people and openness to dialogue While stating that ultimate authority rests with me in his archdiocese he added in reference to the laity that they also know they have a right to have a part in the decisions He has also shown an ability to face up to the most discouraging signs of stagnation and loss in the church Calling on bishops to exert stronger efforts in evangelism he criticized what he called a defensive posture taken by bishops who refused to meet modern challenges He said bishops should seek out both those to whom we feel instinctively well disposed and attracted and those from whom we may feel alienated and hostile Liberal on Social Issues On the most contested issues of church moral teachings Archbishop Bernardin has sided with official church views on matters of sexuality and has shown a liberal mind on social issues He has been outspoken in calling for racial and economic justice and in opposition to abortion Though insisting that the church scrutinize its practices for evidence of bias against women he also has agreed strongly with the traditional barring of women as priests Though many Catholics have disagreed with one or another of the archbishops views most say he has shown a willingness to discuss differences in a climate of free exchange Since he became a bishop in 1966 Archbishop Bernardin has been prominent among United States bishops and in his responsibilities as elected participant in Synods of Bishops at the Vatican He was the first general secretary of the United States Catholic Conference the social action arm of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops when it was organized in keeping with guidelines set down by the Second Vatican Council In 1972 he became the youngest archbishop in the nation when he moved to Cincinnati
"FOR CONGRESS, EVERYTHING IS STUCK BUT THE CLOCK",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/11/weekinreview/for-congress-everything-is-stuck-but-the-clock.html,WASHINGTON CONGRESS returns tomorrow from its July 4th recess with little time left for action on dozens of bills that once were thought to have a high priority Budgetary issues are expected to continue to dominate Capitol Hills agenda to the consternation of the vast majority of members of the House and Senate who do not serve on the fiscal committees Many feel that they have spent the last 18 months treading water Conservatives are among the most aggrieved for they had looked to this Congress elected two years ago in the Reagan sweep for action on social issues The 98th Congress to be elected this fall could very well give the Democrats a stronger hold on the House and weaken the conservatives grip on the Senate Some conservatives therefore consider the twilight days of the 97th Congress as their last best chance to prevail on issues such as abortion and school busing Consequently they are scouting around for must legislation to which they can attach riders dealing with their pet concerns That legislation is likely to be a measure needed to keep some Government agency in business Over the next few weeks Congress will focus on a tax bill and a package of spending cuts that were mandated by the budget resolution a number of appropriations bills a balanced budget amendment and in September after a twoweek August recess a new debt limit bill Senate conservatives dissuaded from attaching abortion and busing amendments to the debt limit bill adopted last month have vowed to try to attach them to the new debt limit extension Fiscal bills may also provide the vehicles for other legislation that disgruntled Congressmen had sought unsuccessfully to bring to the floor only because those bills may be the only game in town The President sets the legislative tone and agenda and this President has chosen to concentrate almost exclusively on the budget process said a House leadership aide There is other must business for Congress to dispose of before its planned adjournment Oct 1 Congress may be called into a special session after the November elections to enact legislation to assure the solvency of the Social Security system Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachussetts said that he would support such revisions if they received the bipartisan support of a study commission appointed by President Reagan and expected to issue its report late this year At the top of the must list is Senate confirmation of George P Shultz as Secretary of State Mr Shultz is expected to win quick approval His hearing this week is expected to last only one day four days less than the Foreign Relations Committee devoted to his predecessor Alexander M Haig Jr The House ethics committee meanwhile intends to move with dispatch to conclude an investigation of alleged sexual misconduct and drug use involving Capitol pages and members of Congress House Democratic leaders fear that a lengthy inquiry would hurt the reelection propects of House members They also believe that there is scant evidence to support the sex charges and that the drug charges will focus on a small number of members When it comes to substantive legislation the social issues are the most volatile On abortion the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved legislation that would give the states and Congress joint authority to restrict abortions but the House judiciary committee has thus far taken no action Similarly on busing the Senate has passed legislation that would prevent the Federal courts from ordering busing for school desegegration and permit dissolution of existing busing orders However the House Judiciary Committee has taken no action On immigration both the Senate Judiciary Committee and a House Judiciary subcommittee have voted to tighten Federal laws to curb entry of illegal aliens But here too prospects of Congressional passage before adjournment are not bright Environmental bills also are in limbo There are slightly better prospects that Congress will act on a telecommunications bill The Senate passed legislation that would deregulate telecommunications and reorganize the American Telephone  Telegraph Company and the House Energy and Commerce committee has begun its billdrafting session Nuclear waste legislation approved by the Senate in April has been reported by two House committees and stands an outside chance of becoming law according to Congressional experts The measure would establish a timetable for selection of storage sites for spent fuel
NEW MONEY ISSUES WAIT FOR CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/12/us/new-money-issues-wait-for-congress.html,The 97th Congress will return Monday from its July 4 recess to grapple anew with the fiscal problems that have dominated its existence including a quest for new taxes and spending cuts and consideration of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget The search for new taxes and spending cuts is mandated by the budget resolution calling for 7698 billion in spending with a deficit of 1039 billion Congress has sought to persuade financial markets that it is serious about cutting Government spending and reducing the Federal deficit on the theory that if investors gained confidence they would then lower interest rates speeding economic recovery However Congress has rarely increased taxes in an election year and many legislators fear that new cuts in spending for social programs could also antagonize the electorate Republicans withdrew an effort to modify Social Security benefits last month after Democrats threatened to make Social Security a major campaign issue this fall but Congressional leaders from both parties have said they might consider modifications in a special postelection session Conservatives Hopes for Action Conservatives regard the waning days of the 97th Congress as their last best hope of getting Congressional action on such social issues as abortion and busing The election of the 98th Congress in November could well strengthen the Democrats control of the House and weaken the Republicans hold on the Senate The conservatives therefore hope to attach abortion and busing amendments to legislation The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee has promised floor consideration this month of a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget The amendment had appeared insured of passage in the deficitconscious Senate but fears that the measure will put a premium on enactment of new taxes have led some Senate Republicans to consider possible changes The most pressing task for Congress this week will be adoption of an supplemental appropriations bill to keep the Government operating until the fiscal year 1982 ends Sept 30 Congress has been warned by the Administration that it must act this week to avert the furloughing of thousands of Government workers In the past such threats have been made often but have rarely materialized Hearings on Shultz Due Another immediate task is the confirmation of Secretary of Statedesignate George P Shultz Mr Shultzs nomination has gained wide support in the Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expects to complete its hearings Tuesday Congress is also expected to act swiftly on an investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use involving Capitol pages and members of Congress House Democratic leaders have directed the Ethics Committee to conduct a swift comprehensive investigation of the charges in the belief that the sex allegations will be shown to be unfounded and that the drug charges will involve only a handful of members The most difficult task will be consideration of a package of new taxes and spending cuts The Senate Finance Committee has adopted a threeyear package of 98 billion in new taxes and 17 billion in spending cuts Of that amount 21 billion in new taxes is earmarked for the fiscal year 1983 as is 7 billion in spending cuts The Republicancontrolled Senate is expected to approve the package but the prospects in the Democraticcontrolled House are uncertain The emphasis on finances has eclipsed other legislation that many say is urgent but that may fall by the wayside before Oct 1 the scheduled adjournment date Bottled Up in Committee In the case of busing for example the Senate has approved legislation that would keep Federal courts from ordering busing for school desegregation and also permits the dissolution of existing busing orders But the liberaloriented House Judiciary Committee has taken no action on the measure and House conservatives have filed a petition to have the legislation discharged from the committee and sent to the floor Similarly the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved legislation that would give states and Congress joint authority to restrict abortion but the House Judiciary Committee has not acted on this measure On the other hand legislation to tighten curbs on illegal immigration has been approved by the Senate and House Judiciary Committees and it may reach both floors Similarly a telecommunications bill which would deregulate the telecommunications industry and reorganize the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been passed by the Senate and is under consideration by the House Commerce Committee This bill also has a chance of being considered by the House before time runs out In the field of environmental legislation both House and Senate committees are working on revisions of the Clean Air Act but its future is uncertain The fate of the Clean Water Act which has been approved by a Senate committee but not its House counterpart is also uncertain However legislation dealing with nuclear waste has been approved by both the Senate and two House committees and is given a strong change of being enacted The legislation would establish a timetable for evaluation and selection of potential sites for permanent storage of spent but still radioactive fuel from domestic commercial reactors

DISTRICT STATEHOOD PLAN: VOTING ON A REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/17/us/district-statehood-plan-voting-on-a-revolution.html,One of the newest sets of words in this city of paper declarations begins soothingly familiarly We the people   But it quickly grows ambitious   of the free and sovereign State of New Columbia   And by the last of its 18000 words the 50page proposed District of Columbia constitution for statehood which will be on the city ballot here this fall sounds as radical as any design of the Founding Fathers The constitution of New Columbia would mandate that the proposed 51st state government guarantee residents a job or an annual income New Columbia would allow public employees even the police to strike It would be empowered to take over or create utilities and charge rates tailored more to the interest of consumers than to that of stockholders The Bill of Rights guarantees affirmative action for women and members of minorities it pronounces inviolable the right to procreate or to opt for birth control or abortion New Columbia would have a state bank for borrowers rejected by the commercial sphere Sweeping fiscal reforms would forever ban a sales tax on groceries and strike down current real estate tax breaks for some of the citys elegant institutions Above All It Is Democratic Were now members of a fiefdom says Charles L Cassell president of the District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention This document is corrective and above all it is democratic The politicians in Congress and the White House have taken little note thus far of the quiet progress that aggrieved Washingtonians think they are making toward statehood In 1970 the District won a single nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives In 1974 the District achieved limited home rule with an elected Mayor and City Council Now in 90 days and with 150000 in expenses the 45member constitutional convention authorized by the electorate on Nov 8 1981 has produced a document that is already something of a collectors item since the movement is out of money right now for printing and distributing copies among the 270000 registered voters Nevertheless voter approval is expected in November The last requirement for statehood would then be approval by a simple majority of the Senate and the House There the issue would pose at a minimum an interesting academic exercise But at its maximum proponents insist the movement will bring the inevitable revolution full representation and selfgovernment for the citys 700000 residents Leaders of the drive feel that popular sympathy can somehow be stirred across the land to spur a reluctant Congress to approval Congress has never been enthusiastic about changing the status quo Mr Cassell noted arguing that even without funds for a public relations drive the nation would come to see the humiliating plight of Washingtonians Under present home rule we elect a Mayor and City Council who then must sit at the feet of Congress he said chafing over the fact that local legislation can be overruled on Capitol Hill DAmato Hopeful but Cautious In the face of popular support for statehood elected District of Columbia politicians are either endorsing the constitution or avoiding comment on its particulars Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committees subcommittee on the District said the city was a long way from statehood but added that he was hopeful it would eventually demonstrate it deserves statehood As New Columbia run by an elected Governor and unicameral legislature the citystate would gain full representation in Congress and proponents insist get a thicker wedge of the Federal aid pie But critics who seem disorganized and in the minority feel that the proposal is weak in its legal and economic assumptions and could sink the popular statehood movement by providing easy targets for Congressional moralizing Well have statehood some day but this constitution is a threedollar bill said Courts Oulahan a Districtborn lawyer and a delegate to the constitutional convention I dont know where the moneys going to come from to pay for it all he said envisioning a citizen invoking his guaranteed right to sue his government for his guaranteed job Mr Oulahan said he was proud of some sections of the document but felt Congress would be wary of such provisions as a ban on capital punishment restrictions on using bail for any purpose other than guaranteeing court appearances and a mandate for fuller pretrial disclosure of the prosecutions case to a defendant But my main point is that the people have got to be broadly educated about the proposed constitution he said urging that copies and critiques be sent to all households But the movements treasury is threadbare awaiting an emergency 36000 requested from the City Council and hoping for 150000 requested from Congress before Election Day No Heavy Opposition Sighted The document would seem to contain enough provisions to set off opposition from most of the singleissue pressure groups that prosper in this town But thus far no heavy opposition has been sighted and city leaders feel that this may be because of a recent defeat suffered by groups that tried to get city voters to approve government subsidies for private schools In any case the framers of New Columbias constitution are making no apologies for controversy When they wrote the US Constitution they did bold things in that day said Victoria T Street a constitutional convention

Observer; SO BUSY DOING SO NOTHING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/17/opinion/observer-so-busy-doing-so-nothing.html,Do you really care friend whether the Federal budget is balanced or not If so here is good news Both the President and the Congress are behind a balanced budget bill It will probably be law any day now The bill says the Federal budget will always have to be balanced from here to evermore unless the President and the Congress dont want it to be balanced Its like the famous law that put a ceiling on the national debt many years ago That law absolutely forbade the Federal Government to accumulate debt higher than a specified limit unless the Congress and the President enacted a law raising said specified limit Scarcely a year has since gone by without the Congress and the President raising said specified limit yet another notch When the balanced budget law goes through you can safely bet your grocery money that nine years out of 10 thereafter the Congress and the President will pass laws making it legal to ignore the balanced budget law on account of overriding necessity to run a deficit Although President Reagan and the Congress have cooperated to create the biggest deficit in the history of the universe this year nobody is laughing at their enthusiasm for this legislative fraud Does this mean you really can fool all of the people some of the time I doubt it I suspect the reason nobody is hooting is that nobody is paying any attention to the balanced budget bill because nobody much cares whether the budget is balanced or not Well I dont mean absolutely nobody cares Obviously there are still a few souls out there in America who hew to the economic policy laid down by the Saturday Evening Post in 1935 and die a little with each years deficit Still compared to the hordes who care passionately about gun control abortion school prayer nuclear weapons and paralyzing interest rates those who are obsessed with a balanced budget must be scarcer than civil rights demonstrators in Red Square If so why are the President and the Congress tumbling over each other to throw them a sop The explanation carries us into the realm of American political myth In 1956 when he was Vice President Richard Nixon stopped in Chicago one evening to touch a few of the towns very very rich Republicans for campaign money Speaking to a few reporters afterward Mr Nixon said he had had to listen patiently to a lot of advice about how he must campaign for a balanced budget You know there is no political mileage in talking about a balanced budget he told us Most people cant even balance their own budgets Why should they expect the Government to do what they cant When he discussed political tactics I always listened to Richard Nixon because he was one of the trades mastersMr Nixon on the other hand listened patiently to what he considered useless advice from the ultrarich They had the money he needed and he was willing to flatter them with attention in order to get it Most politicians nowadays know as Mr Nixon did that the balanced budget has no political sex appeal to the mass of voters but is an absorbing passion to many among the moneyed elite When friends at the Chamber of Commerce are essential to a politicians survival how pleasant it is to vote for an eternally balanced budget at least when you add the proviso that eternity is only a sometime thing The constant lip service rendered over the years to budget balancing has become a strong reflex in American politics and out of it has risen the traditional game in which each political party while competing with the other to raid the Treasury tries to pin the budgetbuster label on the other For years the Republican Party being out of power had the better of the sport Now though with a Republican Administration breaking all records for deficit spending the Democratic Party has tasted revenge When the Republicans asked for the usual increase in the debt limit to legalize their red ink many of the Democrats threatened to vote against it until assured that the Republicans who had been calling them big spenders for years would eat their crow like good sports and vote the bigspender line You probably didnt even notice that did you Probably very few other people did either Who would have cared anyhow It was one of those traditional antique games that American politicians have come to believe are important and which the moneyed elite watch with hooded eyes and which leave everybody in the country who cant afford a house because of 16 percent interest rates bored silly Passing the balanced budget bill will certainly be in the same class millions of people needing so much relief Congress so busy doing so nothing
"CHILD WITH CHILD: LOVE ME, LOVE MY BABY",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/nyregion/child-with-child-love-me-love-my-baby.html,Backward turn backward O Time in your flight Make me a child again just for tonight ELIZABETH ALLEN By GILLIAN HADLEY MONICA did not slip unobtrusively into the school system of the quiet affluent community She erupted like Mount St Helens She sensed right away that her appearance was not welcome She was after all an alien from Brooklyn With her New Yawk accent her stringy and unkempt long black hair and her eyebrows plucked to nothingness Monica was the mottled kitten that mama cat eyes warily in a litter of shiny black ones But to know her was to discover a fourleaf clover in the myriad of trifoliate plants There was a defiant but wistful uniqueness about this frail 75pound 13yearold street kid They never accepted me so to hell with em Monica would spout belligerently I dont need them Oh but she did The truth was that they didnt need her She knew it and it hurt She tried for a while to be like them but there was no way she ever could be through no fault of hers or theirs Monica had known for some time about pot and ludes about contraceptives and sex She smoked in the school lavatories and defied anyone to prove it although her hair her daily uniform faded jeans and matching jacket and her profane mouth reeked of smoke She was more streetwise than those who had been sheltered in suburban Oz could ever be They were not mature enough to understand the subtleties and dichotomies of words and actions of someone craving acceptance Monica had tossed down the gauntlet saying I dare you to find out to see that I have the same scared feelings that you have about yourselves and growing up I dare you to love me although Im different and cannot change Monica was 13 going on 35 in so many ways She could not unknow all that she had heard or seen or experienced She couldnt enter their world of innocent giggles school dances or crushes on 13yearold boys She met older kids who hung around the rainsheltered cubbies of the school the fort in the woods where things went on under cover of darkness Monica was bright but uncaring about school and she managed to graduate from eighth grade It was the first time she was seen in a dress a sight that would have broken the heart of anyone who really knew what that slender body had allowed to intrude upon it without fully realizing why she had permitted it High school was just an extension of what Monica had been through  defiance responding to rejection  but now there were others like her The havenots banding together laughing at the preppies the straight kids and moving farther away traveling down that long lonesome highway and pulling the road up over themselves like a protective mantle They knew that the others would dare not follow Monica is now in her sixth month of pregnancy But she was so streetwise What happened She cant even answer that question for somehow romance is still infused with the hard realities of drugs and sex I loved him and he said he loved me she said And he was nice to me But hes got problems Her parents are angry and confused Shes the youngest the one I would least expect to get into any kind of trouble her mother cried despairingly Monica turned 15 in April and shortly thereafter was placed in a home for unwed mothers They call it Preggo Hill She sits on the porch of the rambling old Victorian mansion waiting for someone from back home to visit There are 16 other pregnant girls waiting for someone or something too Monica never considered abortion It is her legal right even at this tender age to determine her babys destiny Although several of the older girls who have befriended her are giving their babies up to childless couples Monica has vetoed adoption Its going to be a girl she said Im going to love it and raise it real good and never let it get hurt by anyone Well have good times together Unless she places the baby for adoption Monica has nowhere to go from the temporary shelter She cannot come back to our town with a baby There is no room either physically or emotionally for them in her parents future And they have a right to make that decision at this juncture of their lives The social agency said that it would try to place Monica and her baby together in foster care That will not be easy it fact it may not even be possible They can easily find a place for one  the youngest Monicas parents would like her to return home sans baby to pick up the pieces of her life Monica knows that she should complete her eduction but right now she cannot see herself studying for exams going to football games or getting excited about proms The principal of the high school said it had been so long since a student actually went through with a pregnancy that the administration did not even know what rules applied to this situation Monica will have to think about the unspoken rules of her peers If she returns to school how would she handle the inevitable sneers glib remarks and knowing glances as she walked through the halls Or the personalized graffiti that would surely appear on the lavatory walls Giving birth changes every woman no matter what the social or emotional conditions of her life Monicas future seems to be in the shadows right now She knows so much  and so little She is privy to secrets of the adult world Coping with them is difficult for many adults How will a 15yearold survive with little education no skills and the greatest responsibility one can assume And what about the babys survival odds How did this child with child come to this place  Gillian Hadley lives in Springfield
POLITICS; PATRONAGE BONANZA IN SUFFOLK,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/nyregion/politics-patronage-bonanza-in-suffolk.html,THE Suffolk Republican chairman Anthony J Prudenti and his allies  the Suffolk County Executive Peter F Cohalan and the Islip Republican leader Anthony Pace  will have one of the biggest patronage bonanzas in years to dispense shortly six Supreme County and Family Court judgeships The judgeships are part of a 98judgeship package that was created statewide as a result of a bipartisan agreement among the Democratic Governor the Republican majority in the State Senate and the Democratic majority in the Assembly That agreement translates locally to a bipartisan deal in which Suffolk Republicans will get six judgeships Suffolk Democrats three and Nassau Republicans and Democrats one each The greater number of judgeships for Suffolk reflects the countys population growth while Nassaus population has remained stable The Republicans get the lions share of the judgeships on Long Island because traditionally they could win all of the judgeships in a contested election The Governor and Assembly Democratic leaders conditioned their approval of the judgeship package on the bipartisan agreements at the local level As a result the Suffolk Democratic chairman Dominic J Baranello who is also the Democratic State chairman will have a Supreme and two County Court judgeships to dispense while Nassau Republican and Democrats will each have one Supreme Court judgeship Mr Prudentis choices for two Supreme Court two County and two Family Court judgeships will provide a clue as to just how serious is the split in the Suffolk GOP organization Normally at least some of the recommendations of Babylon Huntington and Brookhaven GOP leaders would be heeded But Mr Prudenti has had serious difficulties with the GOP organizations in those towns including his home town of Brookhaven So the judgeships are clearly an opportunity for Mr Prudenti  an opportunity to conciliate or retaliate The county chairman said he had met as a group with all 10 town Republican chairmen including some adversaries and plans to meet separately with each one They told me that if they had a problem it wasnt with me Mr Prudenti said They all love talking to the county chairman now As for distributing the judicial plums Mr Prudenti said I want to see the attitude of Babylon and Huntington particularly  maybe we can work together as a team Martin Mellman the Nassau Democratic chairman is having second thoughts about his support of Raymond F Gallagher of Lackawanna for the Democratic designation for State Comptroller Indeed Mr Mellman in an unusual admission for a political leader contended that he had been misled about Mr Gallaghers record and in turn had unwittingly misled other Nassau Democrats A lot of us are uncomfortable a lot of us were pulled into that without being aware of all the facts Mr Mellman said About half the Nassau delegation to the Democratic State Committee designating meeting at Syracuse last month supported Mr Gallagher a former State Senator and now chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority One Nassau Democrat A Patricia Moore the Board of Elections commissioner seconded Mr Gallaghers designation What has bothered Mr Mellman is Mr Gallaghers conservative voting record when he was in the State Senate which earned him Conservative Party as well as Democratic support for the Legislature What troubles me is that we should have been told about such things said Mr Mellman Mr Gallaghers candidacy for Comptroller  sponsored by Mayor Koch and the Erie County Democratic Leader Joseph F Crangle  surfaced just before the State Committee meeting He had been a candidate for the Lieutenant Governor designation until then but was rejected for that position by the Mayor and his allies who controlled the state committee meeting Koch aides in promoting Mr Gallagher to the state committee members cited another Nassau Democrat Karen Burstein who had been a State Senator as a liberal Democrat who approved Mr Gallagher However Miss Burstein now executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board denied that she had cleared Mr Gallagher although she acknowledged that she had been contacted by Koch political aides I didnt serve with him I really dont know him Miss Burstein said She added that she was supporting Assemblyman William Finneran of Westchester who was endorsed by the Liberal Party and the liberal New Democratic Coalition Mayor Koch defended Mr Gallagher in an interview He said he liked the notion of a conservative as Comptroller He added that Mr Gallagher was obviously popular with his State Senate constituency  winning 77 percent of the vote a vote that Mr Koch himself needs in crucial Erie County The Mayor added that if he were Governor he not Mr Gallagher would be making the decisions on issues such as abortion gun control and tuition tax credits that concern Mr Mellman and other liberal Democrats Mr Finneran and a third Democratic contender for Comptroller James H Tully Jr the former State Tax Commissioner are likely to be the beneficiaries of the Nassau Democratic disenchantment with Mr Gallagher
POPULATION PLANNING IS DEBATED IN PHILIPPINES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/world/population-planning-is-debated-in-philippines.html,In the Philippines where families of 10 or more are common the church and the Government are battling again over the issues of contraception and abortion Jaime Cardinal Sin the Archbishop of Manila and an outspoken critic of the Marcos Government is waging a campaign to prevent the imposition of populationcontrol policies The Philippine Government does not follow the church Cardinal Sin said recently despite the fact that the Philippine population is predominantly and overwhelmingly Catholic and therefore bound under pain of sin to obey the teachings of the Catholic Church Last Sunday priests throughout Manila preached sermons about the sanctity of life and the blessing of motherhood The church protests followed an announcement on July 6 by Prime Minister Cesar Virata that steps must be taken immediately to prevent the Philippine population now at 50 million from eventually exceeding 115 million the upper limit of the countrys resources With only limited resources and dim prospects for increased financial assistance from multilateral institutions the Philippine Government has become increasingly concerned that unchecked population growth could create what one Philippine columnist last week called another India Workforce Growing Rapidly There has been considerable argument over whether population control should be an economic priority But Mr Virata who returned recently from a World Bank meeting in Tokyo told a Cabinet meeting that unless the annual population growth rate could be reduced from 25 percent to 2 percent by 1987 the Philippines could face serious economic problems and decades of poverty At the current growth rate the Government has been hard pressed to create the 700000 annual jobs needed to meet the demands of the growing workforce The World Bank had insisted that the Philippines develop a comprehensive populationcontrol policy The Roman Catholic Church which is often divided over questions of policy is united in its opposition to Government intervention in the reproductive issue And so far church resistance has partially prevented the Government from meeting its population goals A recently released fertility study conducted by the Population Reference Bureau in Washington estimated that the rate of use of contraceptives in the Philippines was 39 percent substantially below Government projections for 1981 The Government had set 1985 targets at 835 percent By then the population was projected to be 53 million and increasing at 2 percent The Government will make neither goal by 1985 and hopes to get the growth rate down to 2 percent by 1987 Church Wins Temporary Victory With the help of Economic Planning Director Placido Mapa a member of the conservative religious group Opus Dei the church temporarily won a victory in May when the family planning program was struck from a draft of economic priorities for 1983 to 1987 But with extensive campaigning the population commission was able to obtain approval of this years United States aid package for contraceptives from the Economic Ministry despite Mr Mapas objections The church was dealt a further blow when a study conducted by the International Projects Assistance Service showed a growing acceptance of abortion A study involving 286 women and 106 practitioners indicated that abortions were on the rise and that one third of the women and half of the practitioners believed abortion under certain circumstances should be legalized The church argues that population is primarily an urban problem and should be dealt with by using programs to redistribute industry and opportunity Manila is expected to have 12 million people by the turn of the century according to estimates by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Manila now has about three million people nearly half of them squatters

ARMS FREEZE ISSUE DOMINATES A HOUSE CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/19/us/arms-freeze-issue-dominates-a-house-campaign.html,The Salem Common where in 1969 a crowd of 6000 rallied to denounce the Vietnam War and where the militia mustered in earlier centuries was the oral battleground Saturday in a Congressional race focused on 1982s political concern over war and peace the nuclear freeze issue The Common ringed by Federal period houses and the Salem Witch Museum has become in recent years the site for debates on political issues that in earlier times were held at the Lyceum now restored as a restaurant On Saturday Nicholas Mavroules the Democratic Representative from Massachusettss Sixth Congressional District embraced the freeze concept which has become more of an issue here than in nearly any other Congressional campaign His Republican challenger meanwhile sought to embrace the issues supporters without specifically endorsing the proposal The crowd of perhaps 300 people assembled on the Common for Childrens Peace Day cheered Representative Mavroules when he told them he was fighting for the freeze not only in principle but in specifics too He said he had proposed an amendment in Congress to an arms bill coming up for a vote Tuesday that would block 11 billion in funds for the MX missile His Republican opponent Tom Trimarco had a more complicated approach He praised advocates of a mutual halt in the developent and deployment of nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union as doing Gods work He criticized the Reagan Administration for talking far too casually about nuclear war Assails Rivals Motives But he also said that more was needed than the simplistic notion of a freeze adding that as valuable as it may be as a first step it is simply not good enough As Mr Trimarco worked the crowd he told potential voters that Mr Mavrouless motives were political not sincere In a typical comment Mr Trimarco told a woman that the incumbent was a phony politician who had seized the freeze issue for 1982 as he had seized opposition to abortion in their 1980 battle That year Mr Mavroules won by just 8201 votes out of 214585 votes cast It is clear that the nuclear arms freeze issue has political weight in their rerun in this North Shore district Before coming to the peace fair here Mr Mavrouless aides were at the First Baptist Church in Beverly listening to weekly reports on the movements progress offering speakers for meetings and promising help in getting a referendum on an arms freeze on the state ballot in November The antinuclear group was also told that a longsought meeting with the Republican had been scheduled for July 29 I wish you all the luck with Tom Trimarco said Chuck Dolan Mr Mavrouless campaign manager In the meantime call on us for help In return for such pledges according to the Congressman and Regina Villa a lobbyist in Boston and one of his supporters a lot of earnest volunteers have joined his campaign Mrs Villa who serves as the chief liaison agent between the Congressional and antinuclear campaigns said Mr Mavrouless stand attracted volunteers who otherwise would not have become affiliated with the affable streetsmart former Mayor of Peabody Historical Precedent a Key The apparent responsiveness in this district to an issue that appears to be only on the edges of partisan contests elsewhere has a clear historical precedent In 1969 Michael Harrington ended nearly a century of Republican control here by defeating William Saltonstall in a special election fought largely over American involvement in the Vietnam War and a proposal to situate an antiballistic missile site in the district The Sixth which includes the territory involved in the original gerrymander the redrawing of State Senate lines in 1812 to help the party of Gov Elbridge Gerry a Marblehead native has undergone relatively little change in its boundaries since the 1969 Harrington victory But its electorate has become steadily though not yet safely more Democratic One reason the freeze issue has more political breathing space here is that the unemployment rate in this district with a major employer in General Electrics aircraft engine plant in Lynn is below that of the states 85 percent and the nations 95 percent Even so Mr Trimarco contends that he is asked far more often about the economy and about jobs than about the nuclear freeze issue He said television news programs made everyone worry about unemployment even if their own area was unaffected But Mr Mavroules says that since Mr Trimarco has challenged my motives in taking on the freeze issue that will be the predominant issue of this campaign
"IN NEW YORK, AN INVISIBLE G.O.P. RACE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/20/nyregion/in-new-york-an-invisible-gop-race.html,It has been the invisible campaign so far  the contest for the Republican nomination to oppose Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a Democrat None of the three Republicans Whitney North Seymour Jr Muriel Siebert and Florence M Sullivan  had planned to run until the disclosure that Bruce F Caputo who was to be the Republican candidate had manufactured a military service record The late start is showing Mrs Sullivan and Miss Siebert are still spending much of their time working in cramped headquarters organizing their campaigns trying to drum up endorsements and raising funds Mr Seymour whose career like his opponents has been largely New York Cityoriented is spending much of his time upstate making himself available for newspaper radio and television interviews  a relatively inexpensive way of gaining exposure To Debate for First Time The candidates paths will cross tomorrow when they will debate for the first time at The New York Times The three are Republicans but they do not have much more than that in common Mr Seymour who is 59 years old is a longtime member of the citys political social and legal establishment He is a former State Senator from the Upper East Side a former United States Attorney a former president of the state bar association and now a partner in one of the citys leading law firms He is an author of several books and owns a small book publishing company He his wife and two daughters live in Greenwich Village Miss Siebert a 53yearold resident of Manhattans East Side who is originally from Cleveland made her mark on Wall Street  the first woman to hold a New York Stock Exchange seat one of the first women to become a partner of a Stock Exchange firm and chairman of her own brokerage firm Her success in the financial world led to the prestigious post of State Superintendent of Banks in the administration of Governor Carey a Democrat even though she was a Republican She is wealthy enough to be spending 250000 of her own money in her campaign Mrs Sullivan a 52yearold widow with three children returned to college as a middleaged woman taught at a Catholic high school and graduated from St Johns Law School A Resume That Worked Although Mrs Sullivan is a registered Republican she was appointed an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn after she had dropped off a resume with a police officerreceptionist Four years later though still not even a member of a political club two friends recommended that she be offered the Assembly nomination in Brooklyns Bay Ridge section by the local Republican leader She was nominated and won She would not have run for the Senate she said if her Assembly district had not been eliminated by reapportionment My goal when I got into politics was the United States Senate but I didnt think it would happen this soon she said Mrs Sullivan who already has the Conservative and Right to Life Party lines on the ballot will run in November regardless of the outcome of the Republican primary on Sept 23 She contends that she is the only conservative in the race and that her opponents are liberal Republicans There is already longdistance criticism between Miss Siebert and Mrs Sullivan Shes a feisty little thing you wouldnt want her for an enemy said Mrs Sullivan Im probably much more conservative than she is on a fiscal basis she doesnt understand fiscal matters said Miss Siebert Miss Siebert strongly objects to Mrs Sullivans characterization of her as a liberal not an ideological advantage in a Republican primary The reason Im a raving liberal is because Im prochoice Miss Siebert said She added that using Medicaid funds for abortions could be viewed as fiscally prudent because otherwise wed be supporting that kid  it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars instead of 250 or 300 Mr Seymour tries to stay above the fray I dont intend to criticize them he said However he noted that he had admonished his opponents at a recent meeting of Republican women to debate on the issues not as specialinterest candidates They were appealing to the womans vote he said A Supporter of Lehrman Mrs Sullivan has endorsed Lewis E Lehrman for governor He had at the behest of the Conservative Party helped Mrs Sullivan qualify for the ballot at the Republican State Committees designating meeting last month  and in the process angered Miss Siebert Miss Siebert and Mr Seymour are not taking sides between Mr Lehrman and Paul J Curran the other Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Miss Siebert is likely to have the largest campaign treasury starting with her own 250000 and hoping to raise at least 500000 more through her Wall Street contacts Mr Seymour said his goal of 500000 was quite unrealistic Half that is more likely a Seymour aide said Mrs Sullivan said she hoped to raise 200000 although some of her supporters consider that figure very optimistic She is already receiving help in the form of a paid campaign scheduler from the Fund for a Conservative Majority Both Mrs Sullivan and Mr Seymour plan to solicit funds from various political action committees in Washington later this week Mr Seymour and Miss Siebert are planning radio and television advertising Mrs Sullivan is not All three Republican candidates acknowledged that with most attention focused on the hotly contested gubernatorial primaries in both parties it will be difficult to draw attention to a primary fight in which the winner will have only five weeks to wage an uphill battle against Senator Moynihan in the general election
Solid Ground for a Prison Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/20/opinion/solid-ground-for-a-prison-policy.html,Like abortion and the nuclear freeze the issue of prison construction focuses whole ideologies The lawandorder school argues that more prisons are the obvious answer to the crime problem The crimeisacomplexsocialproblem school argues that prisons cost too much and that crowding problems should be eased by managing criminal justice better Their arguments generate confusion enough for public officials who also have to contend with awkward politics voters want to get tough but they dont want higher taxes or prisons in their neighborhoods The confusion over both the debate and the politics too often leads to paralysis as politicians seeing no clear answers simply turn their backs A new report by a New York State study commission underscores the urgency of ending the confusion And it provides a solid basis for doing so The commission chaired by Arthur Liman points out that the prisons are already operating at 15 percent over capacity and new inmates keep pouring in the result of the determination of police and prosecutors to crack down on career criminals The public cheers the crackdown but with contradictions It voted down the state bond issue for prison construction Citizens groups vehemently denounce such sensible steps as moving prisoners into unused mental hospital facilities Complacency the Liman report states dryly invites disaster probably in the form of Federal court intervention against crowding In a sense though opportunity grows out of the advancing crisis which has now overtaken the ideological debate The report makes clear that there is plenty of room for both toughness and compassion Projections of felony convictions indicate that the state will have to find or build many new prison cells no matter how well it manages criminal justice Hence the report contends it should go ahead with plans to build three 512bed prisons as well as to convert unused mental hospital space on Long Island But its also clear that something must also be done and soon about management Otherwise not even an expanded prison system will be enough Therefore the commission recommends a list of management initiatives Use sentencing guidelines to make prison terms shorter but more certain and more uniform  Give easier treatment to some lesser offenders  Use more nonprison sentences  Empower the Governor to release inmates early when crowding becomes intolerable The Liman commission report reflects reality Even better its balanced recommendations offer a way for the toughminded and the compassionate to get together It would be a powerful constructive coalition
PERSONAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/21/garden/personal-health-028231.html,ALTHOUGH about 6 to 8 percent of all births are premature they are the cause of 85 percent of deaths of the newborn and the major cause of such nonfatal newborn complications as respiratory distress syndrome Each year in this country hundreds of thousands of babies born prematurely after 20 weeks but before 37 weeks of pregnancy encounter problems In the last decade outstanding progress has been made both in preventing premature births and in improving the survival chances of even very tiny infants including those who weigh 2 pounds 3 ounces or less at birth In the early 1970s according to pediatricians at Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons only 10 percent of babies in this weight category survived Now survival rates are more than four times greater in hospitals that have special intensive care nurseries Furthermore this increase in survival has not been accompanied by an increase in developmental abnormalities In other words most of the babies now being saved are growing up with no or only minor abnormalities All told threefourths of premature babies today grow up without serious problems The potential for even more dramatic progress in combating prematurity has been shown by the recent findings of a study by the University of California at San Francisco described in the April issue of The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology The researchers working at the universitys March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation taught pregnant women who were considered at high risk for premature delivery how to recognize the early signs of premature labor The hospital staff was similarly educated and the women were told to contact the hospital as soon as they noticed a suspicious sign Those found to be in early labor were hospitalized and treated with laborstopping drugs which work only if given before labor is fully under way In the experimental programs first full year the premature birth rate among women who received prenatal care at the universitys obstetrical clinic dropped from 675 percent to 243 percent Dr Robert Creasy the obstetrician who directs the program noted there were still shortcomings in the system for identifying highrisk patients since half of those who went into premature labor had been classified as low risk Dr Creasy and his colleagues are currently trying to improve the risk evaluation system through a research project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health Meanwhile Marie Herron a registered nurse who coordinated the clinic care aspects of the program concluded that it may help to teach all pregnant women the signs and symptoms of premature labor and urge them to seek prompt treatment Who Is at High Risk Many diverse factors may increase a pregnant womans chances of giving birth before the fetus has fully matured According to Dr Roger K Freeman medical director of Womens Hospital at the Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Long Beach Calif and author with Susan C Pescar of Safe Delivery Protecting Your Baby During High Risk Pregnancy Facts on File 1982 factors that predispose a pregnancy to premature labor include the following Placental abruption separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus placenta previa location of the placenta in the lower part of the uterus where it may become partly detached multiple pregnancy twins or more eclampsia high blood pressure of pregnancy diseases of the liver kidneys or heart a history of two or more previous premature births a cervix that opens prematurely sometimes caused by multiple abortions fetal malformations premature rupture of the membranes cigarette smoking poor nutrition and lack of prenatal care Other possible risk factors include age below 18 or above 40 alcoholism drug addiction genital or other infections uterine malformations or fibroids small stature of the woman prenatal exposure of the woman to the hormone DES poor physical condition and unusual physical or psychological stress Although some of these factors are beyond medicines ability to prevent or control many can be modified or prevented by proper prenatal care Dr Freeman points out And some including cigarette smoking poor nutrition and poor physical condition  can be controlled by the woman herself Treating Premature Labor According to the San Francisco researchers silent symptoms of premature labor that can be detected by the woman include low back pain cramps vaginal discharge and contractions of the uterus that can be felt through the abdomen with the fingertips Medical examination may reveal changes in the cervix that occur shortly before labor begins or uterine contractions that were not apparent to the woman If the beginnings of premature labor are detected the woman should be hospitalized confined to bed and in most cases treated with one or more of several new laborstopping drugs The most popular of these is ritodrine given intravenously at first and if contractions stop continued as oral therapy until the woman reaches term This drug which has been extensively tested stops labor in about 70 percent of cases Dr Freemans favorite treatment is magnesium sulfate which can be used in some women for whom ritodrine is hazardous If labor cannot be stopped or the drugs cannot be used injections of a steroid drug called betamethasone are given to the mother to speed the babys lung development Lung immaturity represents the most serious risk to life for premature babies A New Zealand obstetrician Dr Graham C Liggins accidentally discovered the value of this drug in enhancing maturation of fetal lungs The drug works within one to three days and has been shown to help even the smallest of babies Caring for Premature Babies If a premature baby is very tiny or sick the infant can benefit from care in a specialized nursery Sometimes this means transferring the baby to another hospital The intensive care nursery is a frightening place for parents unprepared for the sight of tiny infants in seethrough enclosures who may be receiving oxygen through hoods over their heads or plastic tubes inserted in the nose or windpipe The high doses of oxygen required to sustain a premature infant can damage vision though the incidence and severity of oxygencaused eye damage can been greatly reduced by treatment with vitamin E according to recent studies Some premature infants must be continually monitored by machine for heart and breathing rates and blood pressure Devices that assist breathing by forcing open the lung spaces may be needed Many premature infants too small or too sick to suck on a nipple must be fed through tubes Special lights may be used to treat those who are jaundiced Still no matter how small or how sick the babies may be studies have shown that parental contact is important to their wellbeing and to the parents ability to care for them after they leave the hospital Through glovelike openings built into the incubator a parent can touch and caress and help care for a premature infant without the risk of infection Parents often need help too in adapting emotionally to the situation Many feel angry worried guilty or disappointed about the premature birth The baby may spend weeks or months in the hospital forcing frequent trips back and forth that disrupt home routines and add to the parental stress Even after the baby comes home all is not necessarily well since a premature baby requires very frequent feedings and may sleep for only a few hours at a time The babys cry is likely to be more irritating than that of a fullterm infant Holding rocking singing and talking to these babies are often effective in calming them Parents should realize that a premature babys growth and development are usually slower than that of fullterm babies They should look for steady developmental progress rather than watching for agerelated landmarks associated with the development of fullterm babies Some hospitals have group meetings for parents of premature babies Perhaps the best present for parents of a premature baby is a new book Premature Babies A Handbook for Parents written by Sherri Nance Arbor House 1595 a wellwritten and highly practical source of vital information on the physical and emotional health of both premature babies and

3 MEET FOR FIRST DEBATE IN G.O.P. SENATE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/nyregion/3-meet-for-first-debate-in-gop-senate-race.html,In their first debate of the primary campaign the three Republican contenders for the United States Senate from New York yesterday criticized each other and the Democratic incumbent Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan One of the candidates Whitney North Seymour Jr accused the Senator of scaring the dickens out of senior citizens and an outrageous crying of wolf in pointing up his efforts to prevent Social Security cutbacks Another contender Assemblywoman Florence M Sullivan described Senator Moynihan as an intellectual elitist who has been living in an ivory tower  who has been conducting himself more like a man of letters a professor of whatever than he has as the United States Senator representing the interest of the people of this state The third candidate Muriel Siebert criticized the Senator for what she said was his failure to help her as State Superintendent of Banks in her efforts to help savings banks on the brink of closing their doors Senator Did Nothing to Help Us I went down to Washington time after time Miss Siebert said I spoke to the Senator He did not do one thing to help us Many times I envied my friends from other states she said I did not have a senator working for me Senator Moynihans administrative assistant Timothy Russert said the Reagan Administration had proposed Social Security cutbacks three times last year He said Miss Siebert and various bank groups had endorsed a package of four Moynihansponsored bills designed to help the savings industry The three candidates covered a wide range of foreign and domestic issues during a 90minute session with reporters at The New York Times Miss Siebert sharply questioned her opponents several times The strongest disagreement came between her and Mrs Sullivan on the abortion issue a disagreement that carried over into an exchange between them and their aides after the debate That makes us raving liberals Miss Siebert said to Mr Seymour after he joined her in supporting the use of Medicaid funds for abortions Mrs Sullivan who has been endorsed by the Right to Life and Conservative parties opposes abortions The three candidates disagreed more on social issues than on foreign or fiscal matters At one point Mrs Sullivan who is using as a major campaign theme her contention that she is a conservative Republican who is running against two liberal Republicans described herself as a Reagan Republican She said her opponents were a Carey Republican and a Lindsay Republican Miss Siebert was Superintendent of Banks in the administration of Governor Carey while Mr Seymour was an ally of John V Lindsay when he was New York Citys Mayor and a Republican Mrs Sullivan and Miss Siebert joined in favoring tuition tax credits for parents of private school students a Moynihansponsored bill but Mr Seymour opposed such credits as discriminating against public school students A constitutional amendment permitting voluntary prayer in the schools was favored by Mrs Sullivan and Miss Siebert Mr Seymour opposed it On defense spending Mrs Sullivan said she was in favor of the Reagan Administration increase in the defense budget while Miss Siebert said defense spending could be cut by the elimination of waste fraud and mismanagement Otherwise there was general agreement on the issues in the debate to the point where Mr Seymour questioned whether any of us are that easily put into categories Like Motherhood and Apple Pie On the domestic front all three candidates opposed a Federal takeover of welfare although Mr Seymour supported a federally financed minimum welfare standard for all states The three favored a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget like motherhood and apple pie said Mr Seymour The three also favored a third round of incometax cuts proposed by President Reagan They praised the President with Mr Seymour who acknowledged that he had supported George Bush for President contending that historians would judge Mr Reagan as one of our four or five outstanding Presidents of this century On foreign affairs the candidates favored onsite inspection of nuclear arsenals and a reduction in nuclear arms All three said they thought that the Soviet Union was either ready to negotiate or could be pressured into negotiating with economic inducements Miss Siebert and Mrs Sullivan said Israel was justified in invading Lebanon Mr Seymour expressed real doubts and concern over civilian casualties in that invasion Loyalty Oath at Issue Summing up Mrs Sullivan said she would campaign as a Conservative and Right to Life candidate even if she lost the Republican primary and despite a loyalty oath request by the Republican state executive committee that Republican candidates support the partys primary winners I can hardly say that I would support the Republican candidate when I would be running against that candidate in the election against Senator Moynihan Mrs Sullivan said Miss Siebert said she was proud to sign the loyalty oath even though she and Mr Seymour had also sought the Conservative Party nomination Saying that the nation was buried under a mountain of debt and was mortgaging the future she asserted that we need business people down there and thats what I am Mr Seymour said that as a former prosecutor legislator lawyer for government agencies and bar association official I know how to tackle some of the very serious things that are wrong with our state and our nation today
CONSERVATIVES ADDED TO ROSTER OF FEDERAL CHARITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/24/us/conservatives-added-to-roster-of-federal-charities.html,The advisory panel of the 87 million Federal employees charity fund voted today to include such conservative groups as the Right to Life and Right to Work movements as recipients and sought to exclude the Planned Parenthood movement The action immediately aroused an intense political controversy After Planned Parenthood officials complained that the standards for distributing the charity contributions from 3 million Federal employees were being politicized Donald J Devine the Reagan Administrations director of Personnel Management overruled the advisory panel and announced that he would reluctantly permit Planned Parenthood to continue as one of 115 beneficiary groups Planned Parenthood has 14 years standing in the charity appeal But Mr Devine ordered an audit of Planned Parenthood and denounced the agency for promoting the detestable practice of abortion We would emphasize that all the liberal charity groups survived after complaining they would be cut out a spokesman for Mr Devine Patrick Korten commented this evening And some conservative groups were added for the first time he said so at least theres the beginnings of balance The recipient organizations in the Federal charity pool received about 800000 each last year so there was more than political ideology at stake this afternoon as the advisory panel met to hear rival groups crowded in the auditorium at the Office of Personnel Management The charity drive known as the Combined Federal Services Campaign was established in 1961 by President Kennedy to give Federal employees a central fundraising program similar to the United Way of America the nations largest charity organization While the Federal organization distributes money that is voluntarily deducted from Federal workers paychecks critics of Planned Parenthood contended at the hearing that the issue involved the use of Federal tax money for abortions There was no evidence presented that we no longer met the funds criteria Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America complained after the advisory panel had rejected the group by a vote of 4 to 2 Objections were based solely on our domestic activities and our position on abortion The advisory panel is appointed by Mr Devine the administrator of the charity and he stressed that he was exercising his power to overrule the group in regard to Planned Parenthood for technical reasons only Political Realignment Suggested The issue of apportioning the Federal donations began heating up two months ago when officials of some recipient groups voiced concern that the Reagan Administration had appointed an advisory panel designed to realign the charity drive politically Mr Korten Mr Devines spokesman emphasized this evening that they all would continue to receive Federal charity donations They didnt get kicked out he said Planned Parenthood officials contended that the charity process remained politicized in light of the special audit of the organization ordered by Mr Devine Mr Korten said however that several other charity groups newly admitted to the fund would also be audited In singling out Planned Parenthood for criticism Mr Devine said he was legally bound to overrule the advisory panel But he added that he considered this matter ripe for a legislation solution to bar the organization in future drives Conservatives Cheer Decision The competition for the charity money involved some of the most active organizations in Washington covering various parts of the political spectrum Conservatives hailed the results of Mr Devines decision as a victory particularly in admitting for the first time such groups as the National Right to Life Education Fund an antiabortion group that has been lobbying busily for a greater voice since the Reagan Administration came to power and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund which has lobbied for years against compulsory unionism and various parts of existing labor protection laws Other groups newly admitted to share in the charity money and identified by Mr Devines office as conservative were the Pacific Legal Foundation the Capital Legal Foundation and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund Mr Korten emphasized the notion of balance in the revised charity pool asserting that a good many liberals have been recipients for years Planned Parenthood officials stressed that the wishes of the Federal donors were at stake and that the written standards not political balance should be the only criterion in deciding where the money is distributed

ABORTION CAMPAIGN TO BECOME ISSUE IN I.R.S. TRIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/nyregion/abortion-campaign-to-become-issue-in-irs-trial.html,A Federal judge has ruled that a trial can be held on a lawsuit challenging the taxexempt status of the Roman Catholic Church on the ground that it participates in political campaigns against abortion The suit was filed by groups advocating womens rights to legal abortions The defendants who originally included the Internal Revenue Service and leadership organizations of the church moved to dismiss the suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan The judge in the case Robert L Carter issued a 55page decision last week refusing to throw out the case He dismissed some of the plaintiffs and some of the defendants but allowed the key taxexemption challenge to proceed A lawyer for the plaintiffs Marshall Beil said they were preparing to go ahead to trial A Government lawyer William J Brennan said the judges decision was being studied to determine if an appeal should be sought Church Dismissed as Defendant Lawyers for the church argued that the suit failed to state a legal claim against the church or against church authorities an argument that persuaded the judge to dismiss them as defendants in the case According to the complaint Judge Carter said the Internal Revenue Service has violated its duty under the First Amendment to treat all religious organizations equally by granting the Roman Catholic Church a uniquely favored status under the tax code If the plaintiffs can prove the judge said that the Government defendants have conferred a financial benefit on the church and that the benefit disadvantages the plaintiffs in electoral contests then the plaintiffs will have made a prima facie case for reliefCongress is not free to subsidize the lobbying or electioneering activities of one group while arbitrarily denying the subsidy to others Judge Carter observed that the plaintiffs would face difficult evidentiary burdens in trying to prove their case but said they had presented an adequate argument for a trial He described them as 20 individuals and nine organizations concerned about womens abortion rights and the separation of church and state They included Abortion Rights Mobilization and its president Lawrence Lader Besides the Internal Revenue Service the defendants originally included the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which the judge described as the churchs two principal national organizations Government Is the Defendant Dismissing the church groups as defendants he ruled that it is against the Government not the church that plaintiffs have stated a claim He also dismissed some organizations as plaintiffs but ruled that the individuals and some groups could sue as voters to contest the alleged infringement of their right to participate in the political process on equal terms with all others The suit focuses on Section 501c3 of the Internal Revenue Code which grants tax exemption to groups organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable or educational purposes providing that influencing legislation is not a substantial part of the groups activities and that it does not campaign for political candidates Judge Carter said the section provided a valuable status because the organization can provide donors with an economic incentive to contribute to it and the organization is not taxed on the income received The plaintiffs he said charge that the IRS has erroneously and illegally granted the taxexempt status to all educational charitable and religious institutions of the church They complain he went on that the church engaged in a nationwide plan to change abortion laws by lobbying and participating in partisan political campaigns on behalf of candidates supporting the Roman Catholic Churchs position on abortion and in opposition to candidates with contrary views
Sex Education and Mrs. Schlafly,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/opinion/sex-education-and-mrs-schlafly.html,Last month a study based on two Federally funded surveys of teenagers and published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute indicated that sex education in the public schools may discourage teenage pregnancy Contrary to rumor young people who take such courses are no more likely to be sexually active than those who dont But young women who have had sex education appear less likely to get pregnant than those who havent A week later while celebrating the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment Phyllis Schlafly announced her Eagle Forums next target Sex education she said is a principal cause of teenage pregnancy The institutes conclusions are founded on nationwide studies Mrs Schlaflys findings appear to be more a matter of revelation than research The current statistics on teenage pregnancy are dismaying adolescents account for 44 percent of all outofwedlock births and 31 percent of all abortions Should Mrs Schlaflys new crusade turn out to be even partially successful the figures can only get worse Todays teenagers did not incite Americas sexual revolution By the time they were born it was already accomplished But to keep them ignorant is to make them that revolutions victims Most parents fear that victimization even more than they deplore their childrens precocious sexuality A national poll last year showed 70 percent in favor of sex education in the public schools Mrs Schlafly who is so quick to speak for the American family would do well to listen to what the American family is saying for itself
GONE BUT NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/books/gone-but-not-quite-forgotten.html,I HAVE been living for the past year or so in the company of some strange women whose obscure lives haunt me depress me and occasionally unexpectedly cheer me They are writers whose minor works and lives Ive been reading for the revision of The Oxford Companion to English Literature on which Im now engaged I am not let me say in the process of producing a feminist version of this volume as a Swedish publisher suggested I should There will be a certain amount of discreet newRogetstyle rephrasing but I hope no extravagant claims It is the very obscurity of some of these women that so interests me they have no Virago reprint valueThe obscure men are interesting too but not to me in quite the same way John Cunningham 172973 author of one successful farce became an actor and not a good actor died in Newcastle aged 43 and his pages in the British Library were uncut That is sad but it is a different style of sadness and it touches me in a different way from the fates of those women who stretch behind us some of them wringing their hands pale forgotten  Well it is obvious why they concern me I ask myself if there is anything representative necessary in their odd destinies any linking thread or are they merely casualties each perishing alone Take for instance Letitia Elizabeth Landon 180238 known as LEL dubbed the snubnosed Brompton Sappho by Disraeli Landon wrote a lot of rather poor poetry translated bits of George Sand reviewed innumerable books was temporarily engaged to a young man Dickenss future biographer who ditched her when he discovered her name was touched by scandal she then in a fit of defeat or despair married the governor of the Gold Coast where she died shortly after her arrival from an accidental overdose of prussic acid Accidental The records suggest in her defense that she was in the habit of taking the stuff for her nerves a drastic solution Her nerves had probably been unsettled by the life of an unprotected woman struggling to earn her living in a mans world where delivering copy of an evening to an editors house gave rise inevitably to rumor  founded or ill founded who now cares or knows for she is dead and in another country What of Anna Laetitia Barbauld 17431824 whose husband the Rev Rochemont Barbauld killed himself after years of increasingly violent depression and paranoia leaving her to write for her life to write prose poems for children to write introductions some of lasting value to edit 50 volumes of British novelists to write poems for adults some of them much better than LELs though equally forgotten What of Mary Russell Mitford 17871855 who wrote to pay off the debts of her quackdoctor father What of Mrs Caroline Archer Clive 180173 the crippled novelist who burned to death while writing in her boudoir What of Mary Elizabeth Braddon 18371915 who acted as stepmother to her lovers five children married him on the death of his insane wife produced six children of her own and kept everyone going by writing sensational novels like Lady Audleys Secret What of Ouida 18391908 who after a lavish success died destitute and in debt at Viareggio surrounded by cats What of Mary Wollstonecraft 175997 pioneer of womens rights and Charlotte Bronte 181655 a more subversive pioneer both of whom died of complications arising from pregnancy What of Christina Rossetti 183094 who was twice engaged to insignificant men and who wrote with heartbreaking candor of her yearning for love and love of a kind that no amount of critical discussion of agape and eros can disguise What of Virginia Woolf What of Sylvia Plath This is not perhaps a profitable line of thought Let us return to obscurity and make a new pattern Happily the farther back one looks the more cheering the examples Mistress Anne Bradstreet c 161272 emigrated from England to Massachusetts brought up a large family in difficult conditions and became the first poet of the New World both published and admired she can hardly have felt her life was wasted Aphra Behn 164089 the first Englishwoman to earn her living by writing much though she protests about the problems of her career and the insults heaped upon her for her sex appears not to have been deterred by them she was in love with an impossible man but even that didnt make her very unhappy She went out to dinner with other people and forgot him Mrs Susannah Centlivre 16691723 married as her third husband Queen Annes cook and wrote some good plays Best of all I like Mrs Delariviere Manley 16631724 author of the New Atlantis a celebrated and scandalous roman a clef She succeeded Swift as editor yes editor of The Examiner and died of a heart attack it appears in her printers office Swift wrote of her She has very generous principles for one of her sort and a great deal of sense and invention  is stout fortyish Her private life was unorthodox too she was bigamously married to her cousin then lived for years as mistress of the Warden of the Fleet SOMETHING happened in the time between Mrs Manley and LEL to make the life of a woman of letters more difficult Whom shall we blame Queen Victoria and the new model of womanhood Certainly in the Victorian period women became more cautious George Eliot and the Brontes published under male pseudonyms Mary Shelley once so courageous defensively rewrote history thereby making it easier for history to forget that she too could write Mrs Gaskell tidied up Charlotte Bronte Charlotte Bronte tidied up Emily Bronte In the 19th century major and minor women writers were forced into unnatural postures of hypocrisy and we inherit their deformities They could no longer lead or choose to lead the freewheeling tavernvisiting lives of their predecessors Gentility and discretion had set in It is vain to protest that these women were happy with their lot The preVictorian Jane Austen in many ways a model of womanly propriety wrote with veiled but biting irony about the fate of the old maid undervalued and despised by a society dominated from the womens point of view by the marriage market Charlotte Bronte in Shirley wrote with passionate indignation about the frustrations of the lives of unmarried women who could play no part in the outside world and who were condemned by educational restrictions and lack of physical grace to a tedious round of pointless charity and tea parties She was condemned for the strength of her feelings they were considered unwomanly Matthew Arnold a gentleman if ever there was one considered her possessed by hunger rebellion and rage strong words to apply to a clergymans daughter who considered herself and rightly a woman of high moral principle and stoic fortitude IT is clear that the women who succeeded in the Restoration and the 18th century succeeded by stepping sideways out of society into a bohemian and often theatrical world where sexual stereotyping did not apply where women were accepted as writers and not as ladies In the 19th century possibly as a result of the greater claims for emancipation made by women like Barbauld and Wollstonecraft women maybe began to feel that they should not need not be pushed to one side like this they could enter the mainstream They could write and be ladies The impossibility of this combination is I would argue to an extent still with us The only woman who achieved both it and literary quality was Mrs Gaskell who was endowed with peculiar grace and generosity of nature a happy family life and an on the whole supportive husband and even she ran into trouble with her novel Ruth which dared to paint a sympathetic some would say sentimental portrait of an unmarried mother When my novel The Millstone which deals with the same theme was broadcast on Womans Hour in the 1960s I had to broadcast a defense of myself for allowing my heroine even to contemplate an abortion Times had not changed then maybe they have now It is Charlotte who haunts me most I must confess She so longed for normality she wanted love suffered appallingly when she fell in love with a married man and in the end married her fathers curate because perhaps at least he loved her It killed her I dreamed the other night that I was in a cemetery outside a female Buddhist rape center gazing at the white pulsing heart under a stone on the Gold Coast Each writers epitaph was a slit like a stab wound accompanied by initials I apologize for this image and assure the world of scholarship that it will not find its way into the Oxford Companion

called McCarthyism back in the frightened 50s This time it is aimed at the paramount issue of our lives the worldwide movement for nuclear disarmament Its a dynamite tactic whether books are to be banned politicians discredited or the nuclear freeze campaign smeared as now in the latest manifestation of trying to destroy opponents with the proCommunist label Its that tired old stuff dragged out when rational discussion is too difficult or takes too long or a quick mindset is wanted Simply dig up those loaded jittersproducing words like Redfront pinkos commiesponsored and fellow travelers

knowledge and expertise and so cannot form a judgment and that it will set a precedent for misuse of town meetings which may be asked to pass resolutions on right to life military aid to El Salvador abortion etc The 35 or more towns and councils still expecting to vote on the freeze in Connecticut should be ready to cope with these challenges besides some others which question the legality of such votes The Washington Conn revote overturned a town meeting held earlier on April 13 which voted for the freeze 153 to 81 after only two weeks notice to the public Or did it Secretary of the State Maura L Melley as reported in The Hartford Courant said that the first vote was not nullified and that official town policy would be profreeze because the referendum was not a binding rescinding vote Where did the 394 antifreeze votes come from Undoubtedly people voted for their own reasons their own views of military strategy or they accepted another opposition argument  that a vote for the freeze was a vote against President Reagan and that no Republican should favor it Washington Conn has a 2to1 Republican registration But a major strategy of the opposition was to repeat constantly  in mailings speeches leaflets and posters  that a vote for the freeze was antiAmerican that the freeze was Sovietsponsored and would subject us to nuclear blackmail and Communist subjugation An opposition flier stated If you wish to vote for the BrezhnevKennedy freeze  also vote to have Washington Conn renamed Marx Moscow or Misinformed Car windows carried pictures of the Kremlin with a caption reading The Soviet Union needs you Support a US Nuclear Freeze Letters printed in newspapers attacked the various groups backing the freeze as dubious and some local newspapers carried antifreeze editorials How many voters were swayed How much did Redscare tactics affect the outcome Telephone interviews with freeze people reflected opinions that it had quite an impact but the Rev Thomas Kelso of the Congregational Church of New Preston said it was impossible to measure how heavy an impact without research or exit polls on voters reasons for their decisions He said further that profreeze people feel we could have won had we not underestimated the opposition The key to success in these campaigns is to get out your vote His colleagues stopped their reminder telephone calls when they reached 350 in the belief that at the very most no more than 500 people could be expected to come out to vote But 735 showed up the largest turnout ever for a town vote except for Presidential elections and the freeze went down by 53 votes At that more than twice as many 341 voted for the freeze as the 153 for it at the original town meeting The resolution was put on the first meetings agenda by a Democratic Selectman with the backing of her Town Committee but very little other advance support as the area freeze committee did not exist at that point The revote has not discouraged the Connecticut Campaign for a USUSSR Nuclear Arms Freeze The cochairman Marta Daniels in a telephone conversation reported that nine more Connecticut towns had endorsed the freeze since then They are Litchfield the Branford Representative Town Meeting New Milford Woodbury Preston Madison Colchester Redding and Wilton at an unofficial town meeting Her committee is headquartered at Voluntown with the state office of the American Friends Service Committee which is involved nationally in the freeze campaign The AFSC has worked for peace and the improvement of the human condition all over the world since 1917 and is a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize Miss Daniels is field secretary here Since the destruction of cities is more to be feared than nibbling namecalling the freeze movement continues to grow from the 30 groups that began this crusade in January 1980 to the more than 100 now from the Baptists to the YWCA The goal is a world free of nuclear dread Both sides must take the first step  a full stop to testing production and deployment Then reverse and reduce The difficulties will be many the negotiations intricate but this much can surely be conceded to the Soviet people They do not want to be vaporized any more than we do The future of the planet depends on the Soviet and American negotiators talking in Geneva about strategic weapons for the first time in more than three years A sign at the June 12 rally in New York City should be an instruction to them Dont blow it Good planets are hard to find
BAKER WANTS VOTE SOON ON BALANCED-BUDGET ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/us/baker-wants-vote-soon-on-balanced-budget-issue.html,A major battle shaped up on Capitol Hill today as Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader vowed to seek a final vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget We really want to close this thing down said an aide to the Senate leadership If opponents of the amendment start a filibuster the aide added the leadership will immediately file a cloture petition a move to cut off debate that requires the support of 60 lawmakers Last week a bipartisan group of Senators denounced the legislation as dangerous and hypocritical and said they would try to alter the amendment or defeat it But the opponents conceded that they were reluctant to give President Reagan a chance to denounce them as obstructionists by filibustering against the bill Senator Bakers aide predicted that the opponents of the amendment would eventually collapse in the face of the measures evident appeal Its very unpopular to be against it he said What Amendment Would Do As now written the amendment would require Congress to adopt a balanced budget every fiscal year except when a declaration of war was in effect Otherwise Congress could waive the requirement only with the support of 60 percent of the lawmakers in each house Sponsors of the amendment admitted today that these provisions might be too strict and indicated that they would accept a package of changes designed to make the procedures more flexible According to Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is leading the push for the measure the White House favors a change that would automatically lift the balanced budget requirement in a period of national emergency not just in wartime But Mr Hatch said he opposed that change In a brief debate today the Senate continued to discuss an amendment proposed by Senator Wendell H Ford Democrat of Kentucky that would require the President as well as the Congress to submit a balanced budget The Ford proposal is part of a Democratic attempt to dramatize the fact that President Reagans budget last winter contained a deficit of 188 billion as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office Debate on Presidents Role Senator Ford argued that as now written the amendment would require the budget to be balanced on the backs of Congress while allowing the President to avoid responsibility for fiscal austerity Senator Hatch retorted that the measure assumed that the President would introduce a balanced budget and that the requirement did not have to be explicit Meanwhile supporters of the move were continuing efforts to force the House to consider the legislation this year The amendment is strongly opposed by Representative Peter W Rodino Jr the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee and he has promised to keep it bottled up in his committee The House can be forced to consider the bill however if 218 members sign a discharge petition As of today 179 have signed according to an aide to Representative Barber B Conable Jr the New York Republican who is sponsoring the amendment An aide to Mr Rodino said the New Jersey Democrat had received tens of thousands of letters supporting the amendment Most are clearly generated by computers he added but they do reflect the political popularity of the amendment concept Theres so much propaganda out there and its such a simple issue that its hard to fight the Rodino aide said In a brief statement on the Senate floor Mr Baker also said today that the Senate would try to consider legislation dealing with abortion before the Labor Day recess begins probably on Aug 20 The issue would be attached to a bill raising the national debt limit that must be adopted by the end of September
"THE EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; POVERTY, BY CHOICE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-poverty-by-choice.html,The poverty rate is increasing and more so for blacks says a new census report Recession and unemployment are the main causes but theres a story hidden in the figures an increasing number of unmarried black teenagers are choosing poverty by choosing to become mothers Family composition more than race has become the most powerful indicator of poverty Most singleparent families are poor and 51 percent of black families with children have one parent In 1970 38 percent of all black babies were born out of wedlock by 1979 the figure had risen to 55 percent Typically a working single woman does not earn much In 1980 white femaleheaded families had a median income of 11908  half the 23501 income of white husbandwife families Black femaleheaded families had a median income of 7425 compared with 18593 for black husbandwife families One reason for the blackwhite difference is the divorce rate its twice as high among blacks Yet a divorced mother can work and at least has a chance of arranging support payments from the father At age 15 a mother who is not married let alone The Coming of Age Too Often Means Babies and Welfare divorced is likely to end up on welfare Much of the welfare population today consists of femaleheaded families abandoned by the father if there was ever one at home in the first place Some authorities think many of the young women have babies out of ignorance of contraception Thus sex education and contraception counseling could help Once pregnant more young women could choose abortion as suburban youths do or adoption But pregnant teenagers in the central city do not often care about contraception do not seek abortions do not put their children up for adoption They choose to have a child and keep it It fulfills their need for recognition as adults To some extent community values support having a child today As for abortion some ideologues still contend that it is a white way to keep down the size of the black population As for parental support young innercity mothers sometimes tell social workers that they were encouraged to have a child by a parent or grandparent Further the larger society which used to stigmatize single parenting has become increasingly tolerant Is there anything to be done to resist these social forces To abandon sex education as some conservatives now urge would make things worse But to be genuinely useful sex education needs to be strengthened to consider all the social and economic ramifications of parenting Something else thats needed in sex education and also in other innercity institutions is more emphasis on old values like the idea that it is all right for young people not to have sex Most important there are sounder ways for 15 and 16yearold parents to demonstrate the coming of age in urban America Jobs for instance Why do so many young women choose babies welfare and a lifetime of poverty at the subsistence level With black teenage unemployment at more than 50 percent what are the real choices ROBERT CURVIN
PARLEY ASSERTS U.S. UNDERCUTS FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/28/us/parley-asserts-us-undercuts-family.html,The theorists economists politicians and evangelical ministers of the new right asserted today that the Goverment had systematically undercut the strength of the family in the name of aiding it and that the family itself was drowning in the tides of sexual revolution They were addressing the opening session of the three day Family Forum II sponsored by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation and Moral Majority Foundation Before the meeting closes on Thursday most of the major figures of the movement will have participated in the program billed as a leadership training conference More than 500 people from 37 states adherants of the profamily movement gathered in the SheratonWashington Hotel to hear discussions on such topics as How Your Taxes Fund AntiFamily Activities and AntiFamily Trends in Constitutional Law Many of the issues discussed among them school prayer and access to abortion are expected to be hotly debated in Congress in the next few weeks and are likely to be focal points in the election campaigns in many states Proposal to Phase Out Welfare George Gilder whose book Wealth and Poverty is highly regarded by officials of the Reagan Administration advocated the gradual abolition of the welfare system and the introduction of child allowances The Government can solve your problems he said It will give you a tax credit providing you forgo taking care of them yourself and put them in a day care center If youre willing to break up your family you have access to 17 different social programs worth 18000 a year If mother and father are both willing to leave the family the Government will take care of the children altogether The Government allowance for every child he said would gradually phase out the inadequate child deduction and would elinate benefits for parents who leave the home In the last two decades the Government has conducted a massive attack on middleclass families he said echoing many other speakers who contended that the tax burden fell mainly on such families Affirmative action for example has been a catastrophe for blacks Womens liberation has been a vicious attempt to ride on the shoulders of the civil rights movement FamilyEconomy Link Traced Dr J Craig Perry special assistant on child and family issues to Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee also discussed the link between the economy and the state of the family We hear a good deal about poverty and how Reagonomics has a negative impact on the family he said In 1776 over 90 percent of American families were living in poverty by todays standards The average national income has gone up several hundreds of times since then but are we happier or stronger According to Dr Perry 45 percent of the total national income is poured into taxes the brunt of which is borne by the middle class And what are we getting for that he said Sex education programs that are in contradiction with the Bible Adolescdent and family planning programs that say to children in your home town Your parents are oldfashioned and so we will explain sex to you and help you avoid having a baby A 13yearold can get an intrauterine device or the pill paid for by taxes and her parents may not know until she has a pulmonary embolism At a panel of Congressmen Representative William E Dannemeyer Republican of California gave a list of issues that he said had risen to the American consciousness as a result of the influence of secular humanism He defined this as the belief that man and not God was central in human destiny The issues he listed were these The theories of creation versus evolution the growing power of the homosexual movement permissiveness in the schools pornography Federal deficits which debase the currency and rob the people and abortion Religion Direct Focus Religion was a more direct focus of the morning session Dr MG Robertson founder and president of Christian Broadcasting Network described the links he saw between the economy immorality and the family Deficit spending from the 1940s through the 1970s put an intolerable burden on the American people Dr Robertson said So it became necessary for women to enter the work force not because they wanted to but because they had to Twentyfive million children under school age are dumped into day care centers by their mothers Teenagers come home and theres no one there so they think How about a little marijuana and a little sex When mother gets home shes tired and squabbles with her husband They get divorced the children lose their role models there is more rebellion in the schools and homsexuality and the children of divorce get divorced themselves The solution A Christian marriage he said Being a houswife is a noble profession My father was a Senator but my mother stayed home to tell me about Jesus Christ
U.S. TO SUPPORT STATES IN REGULATING ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/us/us-to-support-states-in-regulating-abortions.html,The Justice Department plans to file a brief in the Supreme Court Thursday supporting the power of state and local governments to regulate abortions to some extent without prohibiting them The brief as a friend of the court will mark a significant departure because according to legal experts it will be the first time the department has filed a brief in the Court concerning an abortion case in which the Federal Government is not a party and no Federal law is involved The brief will not take a position on the constitutionality of each of the specific abortion regulations the Court is considering in five separate appeals according to lawyers close to the case But it will generally argue that states and localities should be able to regulate abortions where they have sufficiently good reasons Janet Benshoof a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union working on one of the cases was quick to assail the Justice Departments position as supporting infringement of the constitutional right to abortion even though the departments position has not yet been disclosed in detail Use of Department Assailed The Reagan Administration is using the Justice Department as a public relations arm not as an independent legal branch of Government and when they cant get righttolife legislation through Congress they want to appease the righttolifers by having the Justice Department do something for them she said Rex E Lee the Solicitor General whose office handles litigation in the Supreme Court for the Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny that he planned to file a brief in the abortion cases But Miss Benshoof said that one of Mr Lees deputies Kenneth S Geller had told her that a brief supporting to a limited extent the positions of the state and local governments on abortion regulations would be filed by Thursday Mr Geller did not deny this but declined to discuss the brief Laws in Three States The abortion regulations being challenged before the Court range from hospitalization requirements and 24hour waiting periods to parental consent requirements They involve laws in Missouri and Virginia and in Akron Ohio In 1978 Akron enacted an ordinance designed to provide a national model for local restrictions on abortion The Akron ordinance requires among other things that a doctor warn the patient before performing an abortion that it could result in severe emotional disturbances and tell her that the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception The Court agreed in May to review the five appeals and set them for argument in the term that begins in October The cases could be an important test of governmental power to limit the constitutional rights of women to have abortions which the Supreme Court first declared in 1973 President Reagan has urged Congress to ban abortions altogether The state and local laws now before the Court would not prohibit abortions But abortion rights groups medical groups and others argue that these laws violate the Supreme Courts precedents which prohibit regulation of abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and which strictly limit such regulation in the last trimesters The Justice Department which has successfully defended Federal laws denying Medicaid funding for abortions in Supreme Court cases is not a party to any of the five appeals Under the Supreme Courts rules a brief filed as a friend of the court must state what legal interest the Government has in the outcome of the cases In a case decided in the last term Mr Lee said the Federal Government had no legal interest in whether states can constitutionally deny free public education to illegal alien children It is not clear what he will say about the Governments interest in state and local regulation of abortion The pending cases do not involve efforts to overrule Roe v Wade the principal 1973 decision legalizing abortion but rather to impose restrictions that make abortions more difficult to obtain than other medical procedures or to discourage abortions The American Civil Liberties Union and others plan to urge the Court to strike down the restrictions as impermissible burdens on the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right as it has in the past invalidated procedural impediments set up by the states The Court has also indicated however that teenage girls may in some circumstances be required to obtain the consent of their parents or of a judge before having an abortion
EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BY DEMOCRATIC ASPIRANTS FOR GOVERNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-by-democratic-aspirants-for-governor.html,These are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times between Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo and Mayor Koch Democratic candidates for Governor of New York Strengths Weaknesses Q Mr Cuomo what are your main strengths and Mr Kochs main weaknesses for Governor CUOMO I think probably my principal strengths are that I have done the things that a Governor will need to do for the last seven and a half years A Governor needs to negotiate make budgets know about the Court of Appeals know the state and its special problems I have been steeped in those things for seven and a half years and earned a record good enough for the incumbent Governor the Democratic President and even my opponent to say a number of times they thought that Id make a great Governor Q Mr Koch KOCH My strength basically is decisionmaking getting things done I have demonstrated that I am proud of the fact that today the City of New York is stronger in so many ways in objective ways  160000 more jobs the kids are reading theyre doing arithmetic at above national norms the economy is better And it isnt as a result of what the state did CUOMO The Mayor says he has a capacity for leadership in taking strong positions He has disavowed his Congressional record hes changed his mind on basic issues in this campaign three times within a week Hes changed his mind on preventive detention he argues the death penalty differently He clearly takes the position thats popular at the moment For him to run on his record lets look at that record and lets be very very factual about it There are no manufacturing jobs for lowskill people Thats part of the reason that the crime rate is up and everybody knows that too The subway fares are higher The subway service is worse Hes claimed hes happy with the subway service I think the best thing for this state is for the Mayor to remember his pledge to serve 12 years Not because its a moral proposition its not that at all He said it would take at least 12 years to solve the problems of this city He was right KOCH The problem is that you cant catch up in the time that you allot with every misstatement that Mario has made He has made about a dozen misstatements and he does it on every occasion Let me point out As it relates to preventive detention  Ive never been for preventive detention I do believe that people ought to have no bail in certain cases if the judge in his discretion decides that he should get a quick trial because there are security problems And I havent changed my position on the death penalty Ive had the same position on the death penalty for 20 or more years That is a fact Prisons Q Both of you had opposed the partial conversion of Pilgrim State Psychiatric Hospital to a prison Given that voters had turned down the prison bond issue what other alternatives do you have for overcrowded jails KOCH I have no problem in using psychiatric facilities state facilities that no longer have patients and consolidating the patients into those institutions that have them But I dont believe that you place a prison facility in a residential area I do believe that you can buy prefab prisons Weve done it on Rikers Island I do believe you can take existing state facilities and convert them There are constitutional standards when you can doublecell That is what I would do I would not accept the basis that you dont have enough prison space and therefore you have to let people who belong in prison go free prematurely Q Do you have any objection to mixing mental patients and prisoners KOCH In different buildings but in the same area I have no objection to a facility being used side by side CUOMO I have a solution its called a prison bond issue I think we can sell it the next time We failed to sell it the last time because we didnt have radio we didnt have television we didnt dramatize the issue the way Pilgrim does frankly Now the people understand Also the last time I fought to include local jails  125 million worth which the Governor didnt want to We never got the message across to the upstaters that local jails were included and thats one of the reason the upstaters voted against it massively I regret that we didnt put it on the ballot for this year and run it with the general election Q Are you against using the medical hospitals CUOMO Not qua mental institutions Pilgrim yes because there are both mental patients and thats what you did at Marcy and it didnt work at Marcy and it wont work here Taxes Budget Q The Governor is projecting a deficit for next year of 13 billion A twopart question if there were a deficit what kinds of taxes do you think the state should raise and what kind should it not raise And where can this budget be cut if anywhere CUOMO You cannot raise income tax You cannot raise business tax You cannot raise sales tax without ruining or further damaging the competitive position of New York State We have spent seven and a half years coming back from the debacle of the Rockefeller years There are revenues you can raise without raising those taxes We had an auto registration fee for 164 Is it a tax Well it has the same effect But it doesnt affect your competitive position the way business income sales tax do You could put 10 percent tax on video games You could put a lot of levies on airport tax for international travel Now Im not proposing those things I dont want to propose any additional revenues until Im certain theyre needed Theres a lot more we have to do about fighting wastes KOCH If Im the Governor I will exercise the same kind of control that Ive exercised in the City of New York that has made it possible for us to come through If the revenues are not adequate I wont hesitate to propose appropriate taxes I did it here Im running for Governor and in the City of New York while Im running for Governor Ive proposed and got through the City Council got through the State Legislature the legislation that raised our tax  a very small amount 170 million Tax Cuts Q Mr Lehrman one of the Republican candidates has proposed a systematic reduction in state taxes over eight years He says we have to do this in order to make ourselves competitive with our neighboring states His opponent Paul Curran says thats unrealistic What do you think PU FIRST ADD GOVERNOR CUOMO I think its ideal Its ideal and ought to be striven for Of course thats what weve done for the last eight years  to reduce taxes gradually Thats Governor Careys plan Thats how we brought it down 26 billion Whether youll be able to do it or not depends a great deal  for example the Mayor has now said tht we didnt give enough to New York City But then the question becomes how much more will he give when hes Governor How much more should Governor Carey and Stanley Fink and Warren Anderson and those nether creatures like myself who didnt have a particular role  how much should we have sent to New York City How much was he shortchanged And the notion that the realestate industry successfully lobbied to substitute for the capitalgains tax  a tax that cost them more money  is an absurdity on its face KOCH You know what Mario has done And he does it rather subtly  is to really divide upstate from downstate and then seek to put it on my side of the table This is what hes done In this conversation the Mayor is going to try to raid the Treasury Thats what hed like upstate to believe CUOMO Oh I didnt say that KOCH Thats exactly  CUOMO Well lets clear the record  KOCH Lets not interrupt  CUOMO I didnt say that KOCH Thats exactly the implication of what hes saying Hed love to have upstaters believe that this Mayor when he becomes Governor will treat the 62 counties and the 705 million people  Then he goes and he refers to  at the Syracuse debate he refers to New York City as the Titanic Thats his language Do you think thats the way to refer to the City of New York upstate or in the City of New York And then he goes to Westchester and he says the question becomes in Westchester  do you want to become the Bronx The Bronx happens to be bouncing back I want to say that when you talk about divisiveness in the State of New York as it relates to the candidates the guy who is running around setting upstate against downstate happens to be Mario Cuomo When he goes and campaigns against the commuter tax in Westchester and Nassau what do you think hes doing Hes saying those people in the City of New York  they want to rip you off Does he do it in the City of New York He does not Does he tell the people of the City of New York that he has referred to them as the Titanic I doubt it I believe that our three taxes of the personal income and the corporate and the sales tax Those are the three major taxes for the state should ultimately be the median of the 50 states  not the highest not the lowest Then itll take a long time to do it When you each year make up the budget if theres enough money to provide for the delivery of essential services and to reduceetaxes then you reduce those taxes to accomplish that goal If theres simply not enough and you have to use the moneys to deliver essential services that comes first So when Lehrman says hed like to do it over eight years he really doesnt know much about government either but that will wait for November Court of Appeals Q The Republican candidates have agreed that the Court of Appeals has been too liberal too lenient on criminals How do you feel about the Court of Appeals CUOMO The law as for the Court of Appeals builds in a screening commission You dont have to invent one The Constitution has a screening commission and it tells you what criteria youre allowed to use and we specifically left out of the criteria political position or philosophy because there was a debate about whether the executive ought to be able to clone himself or herself on the court What youre allowed to look at is character legal experience and aptitude Now experience you could consider women  as I have called upon the screening commission to do in a special way because thats a unique experience You can consider criminaljustice experience not weak not soft not tough but criminaljustice experience Q So you dont think the court has been too liberal or too permissive as Lehrman and Curran think CUOMO There are decisions by the Court of Appeals that of course I disagree with The child pornography decision was a disaster I not only said so I proposed the way to amend the laws to get around that decision The Supreme Court made that unnecessary The confession decision yes in my personal judgment went too far To say that and then to say I will now pick people who agree with me on the death penalty who are good and tough the way I am that misconceives the court misconceives the jurisdiction and would be very bad the society Thats not the way separation of powers works nor should it work KOCH Now I have never yet in the 100 cases where I have appointed or reappointed judges ever asked them their position on the death penalty and thats a fact of life And Ive never said I would as it relates the Court of Appeals But what I have said is that yes indeed I have to make a selection Its not automatic The commission that refers names to me sends me from three to five names for associate judges and seven names for the Chief Judge I will interview those people and I will decide who best reflects the position when as it relates to the rights of society visavis the rights of a defendant charged with criminal conduct who amongst those believes that the rights of society visavis that kind of situation believes societys rights are paramount Woman on the Court Q I want to see how far you can go in making a commitment to appoint a qualified woman to the Court of Appeals one of those five a woman CUOMO If they give me a woman in the first batch who has criminaljustice experience especially I will appoint her KOCH Think about what he just said that if a woman is given in the first batch and she has criminaljustice experience irrespective of whether she happens to be the best of the five or the seven that are given to him he will automatically appoint her I will never say that I dont believe that you denigrate the bench by engaging in either racial or religious or sex quotas I do believe you reach out thats what affirmative action is all about in my book and you encourage women to apply Im hopeful and I expect it will happen that when you reach out and encourage people to come in that there will be women who will be among the best CUOMO This transient truth interests me In 1977 we sat here and debated In that mayoralty election the Mayor announced for all good political purpose he would have one black deputy mayor one Hispanic deputy mayor one female deputy mayor He eventually got a black and Hispanic both of whom left him That was a quota system He pandered to them and it worked Abortion Q Both of you favor keeping abortion legal Both of you favor Medicaid financing for abortion Theres been bills proposed to require a doctor to notify the parents of women under 18 before she can get an abortion or require parental consent Would you be for or against those PU 2ND ADD GOVERNOR CUOMO I have always said that once the Supreme Court made abortion legal it was my place to recognize it as a public official  not as a private person not individually What my individual morality what my daughters is  which is more pertinent  what my wifes is  which is more pertinent  thats irrelevant I think I personally have never favored abortion I personally for myself have opposed it When the Supreme Court made it a legal proposition as a lawyer as a public official that lives in a jurisdiction and that uses laws under the Supreme Courts rulings I said that if youre going to give the right to abortion you must give it equally the way when you gave the right to appeal you have to give that equally So Im for Medicaid funding for abortion because the Constitution has made it legal The other question was notification I would like to think that if it occurred to my daughter and she were troubled she would come to me voluntarily I dont think you can make her come to me with a statute I dont think that kind of thing does any good KOCH Nobody really likes abortion that I know of But I believe the United States Supreme Court decision is correct that a woman has the right in consultation with her doctor to make that decision and nobody should be denied a surgical measure if theyre poor when theyre entitled to every other surgical measure simply because it happens to be abortion Ive taken the position from the very beginning when that was threatened that the city and the state and the city alone if it were required would pay the Medicaid costs Now as it relates to those underage and abortion there is a report which is supported by the ACLU which says that you have to have informed consent And I believe that I believe that a doctor has to make a determination to see and to satisfy for future records whether or not the person under age knows what she is doing on the subject Westway Q Lets talk about Westway How concerned are you gentlemen about a Federal judges finding that state and Federal officials suppressed some unfavorable environmental findings important findings according to laws governing that sort of thing Do you think we should go again for a smaller kind of roadway What should we do now CUOMO I have been for Westway because I didnt think the tradein was available at anything like a proportionate number of dollars And so Ive been for Westway from the beginning Am I troubled about what the Court said Ive received inquiries as ombudsman for the State of New York people complaining about it  especially people against Westway who said this ought to be looked into Were having it looked into I have the benefit of a volunteer Tom Puccio who has some experience in investigation who is looking at that along with Mike Armstrong who knows a little bit about investigations too having done the Knapp Commission here Now this difficulty may slow down the Westway project so much that you could lose it but you mustnt assume that if there was something untoward that that means the Westway project is  KOCH Westway will be built in my judgment Judge Griesas decision is a procedural one ultimately a decision as to whether or not the striped bass will live and survive and mate on the New York side of the Hudson River or whether we have to build them a motel north of Poughkeepsie Q How about the suppression part KOCH As it relates to whether or not they suppressed it those are state employees  and I do not believe myself and I dont have any basis for making a decision  I dont think people engaged in criminal conduct to suppress evidence If they did its the job at least of the Lieutenant Governor to root it out We root out criminal conduct on a city basis Public Service Commission Q Do either of you have any specific proposals to change the way utilities are regulated in the state Do you believe that the Nine Mile 2 nuclear plant upstate should be stopped Do you favor proposals to phase in the Shoreham  the rate increase that will result from Shoreham CUOMO Yes the PSC has to change I believe that Ollie Koppel is on to something in the Assembly I think we need to restructure the PSC to break it down into at least two functions He recommends three one ratemaking one enforcement and compliance and third a consumers advocate role within the commission I would definitely break down the PSC or try to the way Ollie Koppel suggests into two departments one ratemaking and one compliance Theres another thing you ought to do The PSC deals with utilities that have a monopoly What you lose when you have a monopoly is the benefit of competition We can build competition into these utilities by setting performance standards for the way they function Q And Shoreham and Nine Mile 2 CUOMO I have said about Indian Point that if the hearing does not say absolutely certain that its safe that you cant go forward with it no matter how much it costs You have to shift the burden to the national people If they can come up with 16 trillion for defense they can figure out how to get rid of something that is a risk to peoples lives I mean its absurd for our civilization to say well its a risk to our lives but we have to take it because its so expensive As to the others where there isnt that same evidence if youre midway I would make the economic judgment that you have to conclude You have to go forward with it You have to allow it to happen Shoreham You cant simply say Shoreham you cant pass on the obligations But there ought to be a device for doing that gradually for passing it through to consumers very gradually Q As Governor would you allow any more nuclear plants to start CUOMO No of course not And the reason I wouldnt is very simple We dont know what to do with nuclear waste from weaponry Its an enormous problem that we dont even talk about KOCH I am for phasing out nuclear plants as soon as were able to bring in more hydroelectric power I dont really believe its the acceptable way to go As it relates to Shoreham which allegedly is 90 percent completed I would not let it go on line until I was absolutely certain And I wouldnt use government people to give me that certainty I would bring in an independent commission that the public would accept because the public doesnt accept the government in this area because of the fact that they have not received the truth on many occasions particularly in the Federal area But I would finish that plant As it relates to Nine Mile which is not at that point where we can say with certainty that a it is safe or b that it has reached the point where it doesnt make any sense from an economic point not to complete it So I would have that looked at before we go forward just in terms of completion As it relates to the Public Service Commission The public is disgusted with the Public Service Commission and rightly so They see it as an agent of the utility companies Its simply passing through additional costs And what they have to have and could have if you had members who reflected the consumer and I would have about four appointments there to put people on who reflect consumers who see their job not as making sure that the utilities get their pound of flesh but rather that yes indeed that they have a reasonable rate of interest Medicaid Q The state spends more than a billion dollars a year on Medicaid I believe its the fastestgrowing state expenditure Mr Koch and Governor Carey and I assume Mr Cuomo had favored state takeover of Medicaid Can the state do that It would help New York City quite a bit but can the state afford it What other things can we do to keep down the cost of health care KOCH You already have colored the picture when you say it will help New York City quite a bit Dont you know that it will help upstate counties even more That the cost of Medicaid for the City of New York is about 8 or 9 percent of its budget and in some places upstate its 60 percent of the county budget Yes I am for a continuation of the Medicaid takeover Yes I am for removing the burden from the realestate tax and Im not talking about the big boys  Im talking about the oneand twofamily homeowners who live in the State of New York who are now paying an inordinate burden that is going up every year It is our largestrising cost CUOMO The Medicaid pickup was of course an area of administration of which I have been a proud  although not terribly conspicuous part according to my opponent And the Mayor is right when he says there is an equity to picking it up The Poor Q Theres been a lot of talk about the socalled underclass  the very very poor or almost permanently jobless Is there anything specific at the stategovernment level that the state can do in getting job training to these folks CUOMO We just missed a glorious opportunity We had nearly a billion dollars worth of subwaycar work which we could have used pension funds to finance if we had had a little imagination and instead we sent them to Japan and Canada and take credit for sending 60 million to Westinghouse in western New York We have an enormous population of lowskilled people and it pervades everything we do We have an enormous population of people who arent ready for high technology because our education system has lagged who should be doing manufacturing We should have had those subway cars here We have to change our education modes to make better linkages better nexuses between the kinds of work we have out there and the skills were teaching people in school KOCH What he said on the MTA absolutely boggles my mind Theres no company that wanted to build in New York State Now if we had done what he had wanted to and given it to Budd thered have been less jobs in the State of New York Budd is a West German subsidiary makes its cars in great part in Portugal and Brazil and the State of New York would have subsidized the Federal Government in the sense that were talking about to the tune of 130 million over a 10year period Is that what Mario Cuomo wants the State of New York to do I dont think so And so we took the lowest bid I think that Ravitch who Ive criticized but Ive also praised when hes done a good job in this area of the purchasing he has done a spectacular job and to have the Lieutenant Governor go around and a misstate the facts and b attack the MTA when it did such a superb job in the area of financing Id say is a disservice to this state CUOMO Let me set the record clear The Budd Company in discussions with us said that they could have done 80 percent of the work in New York State Eighty percent of the work in New York State It is utterly irrelevant that theyre a West Germany company if they did the work here Youre trying to cover up a failure of imagination
SUPREME COURT RECEIVES REAGAN PLEA ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/30/us/supreme-court-receives-reagan-plea-on-abortion.html,The Reagan Administration formally urged the Supreme Court today to give heavy deference to state and local laws restricting abortion rights and strongly implied that the Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion was wrong In a 22page brief which was filed with the approval of Attorney General William French Smith and was cleared by two Presidential aides James A Baker 3d and Edwin Meese 3d the Justice Department stopped just short of asking the Court to overturn the 1973 decision that declared the constitutional rights of women to have abortions The time has come to call a halt to the secondguessing by courts of state laws regulating abortion and to judicial creation of increasingly intricate rules limiting legislative powers over the issue the Administrations brief as a friend of the court said It suggested that the 1973 language in Roe v Wade indicating that at least in the first three months of pregnancy a womans decision to have an abortion is beyond the reach of any state regulation had been eroded by subsequent decisions and should be abandoned A Combination of Shadows The brief which was signed by Solicitor General Rex E Lee contained a detailed scholarly critique of judicial activism in matters of constitutional interpretation elaborating on themes struck by President Reagan and Attorney General Smith in their speeches Vesting the courts with broad authority to secondguess legislative judgments is inherently antidemocratic the brief said Noting that the Constitution contains no mention of the words privacy or abortion  it asserted that constitutional abortion rights were based on a combination of shadows rather than any explicit constitutional guarantee The brief was the first ever filed by the Justice Department in an abortion case in which no Federal law is involved and the Government is not a party It also marked the first time the Administrations political stand against abortion has been translated into legal analysis in formal papers filed in the Supreme Court Fred F Fielding counsel to the President said the filing of a brief urging deference to state regulations of abortion was cleared about 10 days ago in a White House meeting attended by Mr Baker Mr Meese Mr Fielding Attorney General Smith and his deputy Edward C Schmults Mr Fielding said the specific language of the brief was not reviewed by White House officials Expansive Consideration of Issue The Justice Department brief was filed in connection with appeals of decisions by two different Federal appeals courts striking down in part certain abortion restrictions that had been enacted by the Missouri State Legislature and the city of Akron Ohio The Court agreed in May to review those cases along with another case involving a Virginia law in the term that begins in October in what could be the most expansive consideration of the abortion issue since the 1973 decision The Administration urged the Court to vacate the judgments of the courts of appeals to the extent that they fail to uphold the constitutionality of the state and local laws and to remand the cases for further consideration under a more deferential standard The brief explicitly avoided discussing the merits of the actual legislative choices involved in the appeals They range from hospitalization requirements and 24hour waiting periods to parental consent requirements and a provision of the Akron law requiring a doctor to warn a patient before performing an abortion that the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception Substantial Interest Cited The brief said that the Government had a substantial interest in the cases because they will directly impact upon the ability of this countrys elected representatives  both state and Federal  to deal with an important issue of continuing public debate The Constitution does not forbid all state regulation of the abortion decision either during the first trimester or thereafter the Administration brief asserted The Court should declare that the governing standard is whether the state regulation at issue unduly burdens the abortion decision and that in deciding on a casebycase basis whether the burden is permissible or impermissible courts should give heavy deference to the state legislative judgment it said The Administration brief noted that Roe v Wade and other Supreme Court precedents bar undue interference with a womans right to choose abortion rather than childbirth and that the cases now before the Court do not directly raise the question whether Roe was correctly decided The Government therefore does not address that issue the Administration brief said in a carefully drafted footnote adding that the Governments position in these cases however does not indicate agreement with Roe v Wade The Justice Departments position in these as in other cases is not binding on the Court  California Restrictions Barred SAN FRANCISCO July 29 AP The State Court of Appeal today struck down the Legislatures attempt to restrict MediCal funds for abortion in the 1982 state budget It ordered that a writ be issued directing State Treasurer Jesse Unruh not to enforce what it considered unconstitutional restrictions in the 1982 Budget Act The Budget Act restricted MediCal financing for abortions in all but four situations where the womans life or health are in danger pregnancies resulting from incest or rape where the female is a teenager whose parents have been notified or when pregnancy could result in the birth of a child with congenital deformities
Harassing Planned Parenthood,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/31/opinion/harassing-planned-parenthood.html,For 14 of the Combined Federal Services Campaigns 21 years Planned Parenthood has been one of 115 beneficiary groups Then the funds advisory panel kicked it out and voted in Right to Life That produced an outcry that the funds standards were being politicized so Donald Devine director of the Office of Personnel Management overruled the expulsion But he did so reluctantly while denouncing Planned Parenthood for promoting the detestable practice of abortion When a woman requests a pregnancy test from Planned Parenthood and the result is positive she may ask for a referral to abortion services In the referral the doctor and Planned Parenthood as a health care provider fulfill a legal obligation Thus it is not only Planned Parenthood that Mr Devine dislikes but also the law the agency is obeying Now in overruling the advisory panel which he appoints and supervises for technical reasons Mr Devine is using another technicality to support the panels aim He has told Planned Parenthood which filed seven months ago as an international services agency its usual category that it has until Aug 9 to refile in another category That switch involves 500 applications and a logistical nightmare Expulsion having failed Mr Devine and his panel are attempting strangulation by red tape Who asked them to Its not as if Federal employees need them to prevent payroll contributions from going to causes they dont endorse Their money can be earmarked for favored charities and kept out of the common pool Nor is there evidence that Planned Parenthood falls short of the criteria for inclusion in the fund Who appointed Mr Devine and his panel to be the arbiters of the Government workers conscience
OLD NEMESIS HAUNTS CHINA ON BIRTH PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/01/world/old-nemesis-haunts-china-on-birth-plan.html,After Gao Lihua a teacher from Jilin Province in northeastern China married Chen Xudong a soldier she committed an unpardonable sin in the eyes of his family She gave birth to a daughter Forboding filled the family even before the birth because the baby had been conceived in May a month that folk tradition holds produces girls Miss Gaos motherinlaw tried to make her get an abortion Her fatherinlaw a Communist Party member who headed the county planning commission complained that the family lineage would end Both parents pressed their son to get a divorce When the baby was born Mr Chen came home on furlough and beat his wife leaving her with numerous facial injuries and a brain concussion Her fatherinlaw who sat watching television during one beating told Miss Gao later Dont come to me for help Our family simply doesnt want you Abuse of Hapless Wives Miss Gaos ordeal is just one of the cases related in the controlled Chinese press lately about the abuse of hapless wives who give birth to a daughter The decision to publicize such stories suggests official concern that the countrys stringent family planning program may be making some Chinese families press more than ever for a son The traditional Chinese preference for a male child over a female one poses the greatest obstacle to the current policy of limiting new families to a single child A directive last spring said that urban couples who had more than one child would be punished In the countryside local authorities sometimes let peasants have a second child if the first is a daughter reasoning that a girl will not be strong enough to help her father with the field work More often women who have one child are told to use birth control devices and to have an abortion if they become pregnant again The pressure on families is likely to mount as China faces the prospect of seeing its population exceed the 12 billion target that has been set for the year 2000 12 Percent Birth Rate The birth control policies while draconian by Western standards have trimmed Chinas population growth rate to 12 percent as compared with an average of 2 percent for other developing countries But Deputy Prime Minister Chen Muhua who oversees the family planning program acknowledged earlier this month to Rafael M Salas the director of the United Nations fund for population activities that Chinas growth rate has begun inching back up toward 13 or 14 percent The Chinese Government has instituted measures to make families more content with a single female child A daughter may take her mothers surname She may inherit her fathers factory job when he retires To forestall parental fears about a lonely old age daughters have been made legally responsible for supporting elderly parents just as sons are Family planning posters and billboards that declare An Only Child Is a Happy Child or similar sentiments invariably feature a pigtailed girl with her smiling prosperous parents Feudal Thinking But a schoolteacher here said the desire for a son remained though the Government periodically claims to have eradicated feudal thinking Its often the fault of the grandparents because they want a grandson to carry on the family name he said Then after a pause he added But it is that way in the West too isnt it Chinas Health News disclosed earlier this month that some women were having fetal tests in hospitals to determine the sex of their unborn child and then undergoing an abortion if a girl was predicted The newspaper warned that this misuse of technology could produce a serious imbalance of the sexes in a few years Sometimes the babies themselves are the victims of prejudice Early last month a peasant near Shenyang fished a sack out of a river and found the corpse of a female infant tied to a stone Drowning is an old Chinese way of disposing of unwanted daughters though a report several years ago mentioned eight baby girls who were found suffocated in a sack left at a Communist Party office A woman from Anhui Province heard of cases there where peasants abandoned a baby daughter on the doorstep of the local party headquarters and lit a firecracker to attract attention to the child before running off Mistreatment of Mothers But the mistreatment of mothers seems to get more attention as these recent accounts in newspapers show  Jiang Yujie a transport worker in Shenyang was cursed and beaten by her husband and motherinlaw after she gave birth to a daughter Her motherinlaw urged her husband to seek a divorce and promised to find him a wife who could produce a son Last April Miss Jiang killed herself by drinking seven bottles of insecticide  Ding Xueling a farm worker in Shandong Province had a girl after three years of marriage Her miner husband with his mothers approval drove her out of the family and took up with another woman Miss Ding suffered a breakdown In reporting such cases the press has taken pains to point out that the offending husbands and inlaws have been punished Gao Lihuas husband faced a courtmartial and her fatherinlaw was suspended from his county post But even those who agree that China needs a tough birth control policy have regrets about its personal impact The desire for a son appears to be the main reason why more couples do not take out a single child certificate in which they pledge to have no more children in return for preferential medical and schooling benefits
THE NATION IN SUMMARY; Court Nudged On Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/01/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-court-nudged-on-abortions.html,Though no Federal statutes are involved in the abortionlaw appeals pending before the United States Supreme Court the Justice Department made good on Attorney General William French Smith promise to encourage judicial restraint in cases involving social issues In a move that delighted antiabortion groups and others who regard Federal judges as overly meddlesome it weighed in with an unusual friend of the court brief Government lawyers asked the Court to give heavy deference to state and local abortion restrictions The 22page brief came close but didnt quite ask for the Court to overturn its 1973 decision that said women have a constitutional right to abortions Vesting the courts with broad authority to secondguess legislative judgments is inherently antidemocratic the brief said The Court agreed earlier this year to review lower court rulings striking down abortion restrictions enacted by legislatures in Missouri and Virginia and by the city of Akron One disputed restriction requires an unmarried girl who is under 15 years of age to obtain the permission of a parent or a judge before obtaining an abortion Another says a doctor cant perform a requested abortion for at least 24 hours after his patient has signed a consent form
LESSONS OF A LOST POLITICAL RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/01/nyregion/lessons-of-a-lost-political-race.html,HAVING spent the better part of two years and about 60000 to win 26 percent of the vote in my race against a 10term incumbent for the Democratic nomination for Congress in New Jerseys 11th District I am now a far wiser man Among the things I learned 1  It doesnt matter if youre rich or poor so long as you have a lot of money People do not like to contribute money to a candidate who really needs it A truly needy candidate is treated with about as much respect as a 42d Street windshield washer Naive people can never understand how a millionaire Kennedy or Rockefeller can ask others to give him money to run for office The fact is that they are the ones who have the easiest time raising political money Its part of the gowithawinner syndrome If youre putting up 1 million of your own money people consider you a serious candidate Furthermore they make bigger contributions You cant offer a Frank Lautenberg 25 People figured that 25 was a sizable contribution to a campaign chest like mine Unfortunately they were right More important than people political action committees dont take you seriously unless you come to them already wellheeled The first question that a PAC director asks is How much money have you raised so far You cant lie very much because its all publicly reported When you tell them they laugh at you And when you tell them that if you already had the money you wouldnt need them they just laugh some more 2  Once you prove youre going to win you can get all the help you need This is closely related to Lesson No 1 The most persistent line that Ive heard over the last two years is Id love to help you but you cant win I have no doubt that if all the people who told me that had helped me I would have  won that is As a certified progressive Democrat Stewart Mott was one of the first persons I went to for help After making some inquiries in New Jersey his staff informed me that he wouldnt assist me because I couldnt win Six months later Mr Motts staff learned that the liberally oriented National Committee for an Effective Congress had rated my campaign marginal Thus convinced I had a chance Mr Mott changed his mind and agreed to sponsor a fundraiser in Washington I then went back to the National Committee for an Effective Congress which earlier had told me that it didnt think it could help me because I could not win When the NCEC staff heard that Mr Mott was helping me it was impressed He must think you have a chance one of its directors told me Well have to reconsider our position I do not know whether the NCEC ever discovered that Mr Motts support was based on its own assessment of my viability 3  Never count on anyone who is over 30 and who is or wants to be part of the political establishment Active Democrats including those from my ideological wing of the party spent two years crossing streets to avoid me Some of them would tell me  over secure telephones or in a dark alley in the dead of night  that they were secretly supporting me however since I was running against an incumbent Democrat they said they couldnt possibly do anything publicly Since they couldnt tell anyone they were supporting me and couldnt make a financial contribution which would be listed in a public record it was not clear just how they were supporting me Some of them even let my opponent claim they were supporting him They always assured me it wasnt true but they couldnt possibly disown his claim 4  When the going gets tough the Old Boys stick together This is sometimes called the power of incumbency Membership in The Club carries lots of fringe benefits For example it is next to impossible to get any past or present member of Congress to help someone running against an incumbent member Even the courageous Father Drinan who is now chairman of Americans for Democratic Action whose local affiliate had endorsed me wouldnt even pose for a photograph A knowledgeable Washingtonian suggested that he still liked to swim at the House gym where he regularly ran into my opponent One freshman Democrat did lend his name to my Washington fundraiser and I heard that he received a critical letter from Speaker ONeill as a result Former Representative Andrew Maguire a Senate candidate in the primary went so far as to cancel a benefit appearance by Ed Asner He explained that he did not want to offend my opponent a former colleague who was blaming Mr Maguire for the fact that Mr Asner was planning to make an appearance on behalf of my campaign the same day  Then Mr Asner himself canceled his appearance for me and I later learned that at least one liberal Los Angeles Congressman who agreed with me on issues far more often than he did with my opponent had interceded with Mr Asner at my opponents behest 5  The voting machines are rigged My kids kept asking me how we could be sure that wed get an honest count on Election Day The truth is that I have no idea In fact I have a sneaking suspicion that the voting machines are rigged How else explain that at least 13000 people personally told me or a member of my family that they voted for me and yet I read in the papers that I received a little less than 9000 votes There are also at least two districts in Orange where people could not have voted for me even if they wanted to not until 1130 AM when the Essex County Board of Elections finally agreed that it would be fairer if my name were placed on the voting machine Until that time somebody elses name appeared on those machines where mine was supposed to be For some reason or other  maybe its just paranoia  I have difficulty believing that election officials would have permitted continued use of the voting machines if the incumbents name had been left off 6  If you dont have a barrel of money youd better be prepared to fight for turf As a constitutional lawyer I was appalled to find how little respect anyone has for freedom of speech Since we had no media budget I and my family spent a lot of time greeting voters and handing out campaign literature at places where crowds gathered  from shopping malls and railroad stations to polling places on Election Day On numerous occasions we were placed in a position of having to defy asserted authority and fight for our turf and the most elementary principle of a democratic society The right to communicate with the electorate In the course of the campaign we had to  Institute a successful lawsuit against the Livingston Mall  Threaten to sue Conrail when it ordered me off of the platform of a train station  Stand our ground against numerous supermarket managers and tell them to go ahead and call the police if they were going to insist in prohibiting us from campaignng in front of their stores  Quit an Election Day fight with the West Orange police over my wifes right to communicate with voters outside a polling place There was no effective way to vindicate her right before the polls closed and it would have served no useful purpose to have her spend several hours in jail during voting hours My wife Marilyn who is also a lawyer even had one turf battle with Peter Shapiro the Essex County Executive and also a candidate for reelection Both had positioned themselves in front of the same newspaper store on a Sunday morning After a brief spat she finally abandoned her post and planted her flag at the bagel shop across the street 7  Its hard to hit a moving target Another asset of incumbency is the power of a legislator to change his political positions almost instantaneously Particularly since Congress votes on the same issues over and over again its quite easy for a member to very quickly become a champion of an issue for which he was criticized for opposing just a week ago He can then use taxpayer funds to communicate his new position to any constituent he thinks might care about the issue In the middle of the campaign my opponent began to inform his constituents via his Congressional stationery that he was a consistent opponent of the MX missile the appropriations for which he occasionally voted against only after I had chastised him for his support And despite a long record of total opposition to a womans right to choose abortion he permitted an aide toward the end of the campaign when abortion became a major issue to imply that he supported the Supreme Courts 1973 abortion decision There are not too many unelected persons who can claim to have had such a substantial impact on Congressional activity 8  Every election has a silver lining or two Mine are the Third District of ParsippanyTroy Hills and the town of Mountain Lakes I carried the former by a margin of 6 to 1 beating my opponent 24 to 4 If only I knew what we did right there  Mountain Lakes was the only one of the 27 municipalities in the 11th District that I carried outright My children think I should run for Mayor there However I doubt that all those Mountain Lakes Republicans would concur 9  If youre going to get only 26 percent of the vote make sure that you have at least eight opponents If I had been running for the United States Senate nomination 26 percent would have been enough for me to win

THEATER; SUBJUGATED BUT UNSUBDUED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/01/nyregion/theater-subjugated-but-unsubdued.html,PURCHASE AT the mad impetuous rate shes going Estelle Parsons may be cornering the market on politically oriented onewoman plays by international playwrights Having put her indelible imprint on Miss Margaritas Way the monologue about a tyrannical crazed schoolteacher by the Brazilian playwright Roberto Athayde  a vehicle that continues to transport her through theatrical and lecture circuits nationwide  the actress has turned to a cycle of nine plays collectively and cunningly called Female Parts by two Italian playwrights Franca Rame and Dario Fo Four plays in the cycle have been adapted into English so far Miss Parsons has three of them in her repertoire and shes performing in two at the State University of New Yorks Center for the Arts here  one of the theater events in the Pepsico Summerfare Arts Festival One suspects it will not be long before Miss Parsons will take a stranglehold on the nine  perhaps in a single marathon long days journey into the art of the monologue or in rotating repertory or any which way she chooses On the evidence of her virtuosa display in the first two pieces the actress shes the director too ought to have her way with the whole bunch In her straighton nononsense completely winning introduction to the evening Miss Parsons declares Im not going to announce a cast change Here I am and Im it provides background information about the plays and the playwrights  they are a wifeandhusband writing and performing team in the commedia delarte tradition  and lunges into a mock Italian dialect that matches her flamboyant costumes comic statements In a precariously lowcut robe replete with feathers  just what the bored housewife would wear while ironing  Miss Parsons acts A Woman Alone the title of play No 1 She regales a neighbor the audience with the gossip the details and the frustrations  by turns funny and frightening  of her life as a housebound wife and mother who isnt so much cooped up as literally locked in She irons and sings and dances and prattles on about how she has everything  including a refrigerator that makes round ice cubes and a washing machine that even washes paper At recurring and then overlapping intervals the baby cries behind one closed door and her paralyzed brotherinlaw honks at her behind another The telephone rings its either the heavy breather He calls two to three to four thousand times a day or her husband whose inquiries Are you happy  constitute an obscenity of another sort Im very happy she screams insistently into the receiver Theres a voyeur young lover with whom her husband once found her which is why shes not let out is trying to break into the apartment True to the formula of farce David Jenkinss sleek Italianate set design is full of doors Miss Parsons is constantly opening and closing them and pconcealed rooms In each one theres blaring music  the antedote to loneliness ranging from grand opera to raunchy rock and roll It isnt long before we get the picture  and in Miss Parsonss antic demonstration a completely etched one  of a woman at the edge Shes the epitome of hysteria hanging on popping pills and struggling to keep from slashing her wrists as she once did or maybe hanging herself The plays external chaos reflects her inner noisy desperation Throughout a fusion of fanciful foolishness and pathos permeates the writing My husband had me followed without even telling me she declares with wonder The brotherinlaw who is preoccupied with pornographic books is wheeled out encased in a plastic cast except for a few of his parts including one free mobile and groping hand The unseen husband who protects her from everybody except himself punches her as if she were a man she announces Its one way I get equal rights In the play Miss Parsons is transformed from victim to victimizer and after the intermission she goes even further emerging with militarylike attire and militant attitude In The Same Old Story play No 2 the actress simulates the act of sex  and childbirth During the former shes afraid of being impregnated Once her fear proves justified she is aghast at the abortion ripoff it costs 1000 lira and decides to keep the baby and be fulfilled In dizzying shifts involving role switching and reversals the woman endures the unadorned process of childbearing and then has to bear the reality of having one This is the notsojoyful journey from conceiving to bringing up baby A variation of a childs fable about a dwarf and a doll with all the expletives mother would never have dared to utter and which some people in the audience clearly dont want to hear  The Same Old Story with different words  is the highlight of a theater piece that makes its points about woman subjugated but unsubdued with theatrical flair instead of sledgehammer tactics Which is the key to Miss Parsonss performance Besides leaving one but amazingly not herself  breathless she exudes an allembracing air of tolerant wisdom that works in beautiful harmony with words that wound Indeed at the end of the first play the woman is out to do far more than merely wound  one of the props isnt a sledgehammer its a shotgun  but the performance is steeped in humor sheer abandon and consummate theatrical command Both women are angry but also amused One cant resist saying that Miss Parsons acts the first two of Female Parts con brio  and con amore With that for openers the next seven oughtnt to prove all that deadly  Female Parts by Franca Rame and Dario Fo Center for the Arts State University of New York College at Purchase Through Aug 8 Performances today and next Sunday at 3 and 730 PM Wednesday through Saturday 8 PM

SWAPPING STRATEGIES AT FORUM ON FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/02/style/swapping-strategies-at-forum-on-family.html,They call themselves profamily they have a staunchly conservative political outlook they tend to be deeply religious Christians and they are determined to restore traditional values to the family and to remove from it what they regard as unnecessary government intrusion Increasingly they see political activity as a religious duty as they argue that the Federal government has far too strong a voice in their lives As United States Representative Jack F Kemp Republican of Buffalo told them at a recent symposium People ask How can you be a Christian and be in politics I say How can you be a Christian and not be in politics  Millions of people share your ideas he added You are making an impact Representative Kemp was one of the keynote speakers at a threeday Family Forum held at the SheratonWashington Hotel in the capital last week by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation and the Moral Majority Foundation About 500 delegates from 37 states heard such conservatives as Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama Phyllis Schlafly the Rev Jerry Falwell president of the Moral Majority and Secretary of Education TH Bell Secular Humanism A familiar New Right contention was heard frequently that American society is headed in the wrong direction mainly because of liberalism apathy to religion permissiveness and secular humanism a philosophy in which man and not God is at the center of the universe The primary goals of the profamily movement include abolishing elective abortion removing sex education from the schools encouraging women to remain at home to care for their children eliminating numerous Federal social service programs and returning the economy to health The profamily leaders were determined to send the participants home with practical ways to implement their ideas As Connaught Marshner coordinator of the conference and chairman of the National ProFamily Coalition said We must propose solutions and not just pose problems During the threeday conference numerous suggestion were discussed and at a postconference meeting specific strategies were outlined At a conference panel on cottage industries for example members of the audience were told how to earn money without leaving the home Many people prefer to stay at home and nothing is more important than helping women stay at home with their children said Margie Johnson of Falls Church Va who is writing a book on inhome occupations If you work at home you only need to earn a third as much money she said citing savings on child care clothing transportation lunch and incremental taxes A list handed out to the audience of occupations amenable to the home included housecleaning incometax preparation sewing shopping services wallpapering and animal breeding Nancy Motley of Rochester NY who said she has three children in college and four more who will enter next year described how she and other women from her church earned money by cleaning other peoples homes in the spring and fall We may take five or 10 ladies and go into your home wash the walls and windows and even your kid Most of our ladies go away with 100 The most dramatic example of a successful cottage industry described at the seminar also meshed neatly with a primary concern of many conservatives banning elective abortion Virginia Evers of Taylor Ariz national coordinator of the Eagle Forum first noticed a photograph of adult hands holding minuscule feet in a 1974 antiabortion advertisement I said to myself that those feet the exact size and shape of a 10week old unborn baby should be the symbol of the prolife movement Several years later Mrs Evers and her husband Ellis a retired school principal started a business selling jewelry buttons bumper stickers Tshirts and other items all bearing the Precious Feet emblems Except for a small salary Mrs Evers said she plows all the proceeds back into the antiabortion movement We have started a group called We Care she said which provides for the needs of pregnant girls whose families cant help them My hope is to start a home for unwed mothers Returning education of children to parental and local control was the subject of several seminars and speeches Secretary of Education Bell said Education is a family matter The parent is the foremost teacher the home is the most influential classroom and schools should exist to support the home The audience applauded enthusiastically whenever legislation for tuition tax credits was mentioned or when suggestions were made that parents act to eliminate obscene or inaccurate textbooks from reading lists The importance of home education was covered in another session Dr Raymond Moore of Beriun Springs Mich president of the Hewitt Research Foundation said before the panel met We are facing the most insidious form of child abuse today the institutionalization of the children before they are ready Our research shows that childrens senses and cognitive development are not advanced enough for them to go to school until the age of 8 or 10 If they do go before that they become victims of peer dependency and gain a bad view of themselves their parents their peers and they lose all selfdirection Jean Belleville of Spencer Mass described

daughters had read Plato Goethe The Odyssey and Crime and Punishment Mrs Belleville also teaches mathematics and science For history I used a wonderful book from 1959 in which there is respect for government and historical figures she said Latin and Algebra Are Extra A family friend comes in to teach Latin but Dr Moore emphasized that Subjects like Latin and algebra are extra You dont need to teach them Just how large a proportion of the American people the profamily movement can speak for is unclear but according to Connaught Marshner support is growing around the country If you exclude she said the blueblood Ivy League people the establishment intellectuals and artistic set the avant garde and the campus experimenters and talk about real people trying to earn a living raise their families save some money and plan for the future then I think those people have a great deal in common with us at least instinctively And they are beginning to realize that Debbie Hajos of Laurel Md a

RACE IS KEY ISSUE IN PRIMARY FOR HOUSE SEAT IN ST. LOUIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/03/us/race-is-key-issue-in-primary-for-house-seat-in-st-louis.html,William Clay Missouris first and so far only black member of the House of Representatives faces his toughest challenge in 14 years in the Democratic primary Tuesday after a spirited campaign in which race became the central issue His chief opponent in the newly reapportioned district is Allan G Mueller a 39yearold white State Senator from Baden who has been regarded as a liberal in his 12 years in the State Legislature Mr Mueller said he and Mr Clay are very close on social issues and the traditional values of the Democratic Party But the issues on which the two do differ such as abortion and the use of busing as a tool for school desegregation are highly volatile ones here Mr Clay supports busing and favors giving women the freedom of choice on abortion Mr Mueller is opposed to both busing and abortion The busing issue here is steeped in longstanding racial animosity Race Emerges as Issue After Mr Mueller asserted that Mr Clay would favor the interests of blacks in St Louis and Mr Clay contended that his opponent had embraced the issues of busing and abortion to endear himself to whites in St Louis County the racial tones of the campaign eclipsed other issues Mr Mueller said his polls indicated that voting will probably be cast along racial lines He said the polls showed that I can possibly receive 5 percent to 15 percent of the black vote and that he can possibly receive 5 percent to 15 percent of the white vote Mr Clay asked to explain a quotation attributed to him in a political journal that I dont represent all people said I represent those who are in need of representation I have no intention of representing those powerful interests who walk over powerless people In the past the 51yearold Mr Clay ran for reelection in a predominantly black district on the citys north side easily defeating his opponents with 64 percent or more of the votes cast New Makeup of District But as a result of reapportionment which was required because of a decline in the citys population the boundaries of the First Congressional District which Mr Clay represents were changed to include areas of neighboring St Louis County About 200000 people were added to the district and these were primarily bluecollar white conservatives who vehemently oppose Mr Clays stand on busing and abortion Although blacks make up a nominal majority of 51 percent of the district whites hold a 62 percent majority among those of voting age Underscoring his concern Mr Clay said he expected to spend about 150000 on his primary campaign about triple the amount he has spent in previous reelection bids He has also called on prominent civil rights activists and black elected officials to support his reelection effort Record Is Attacked In earlier phases of the campaign Mr Mueller asserting that Mr Clay had missed 1500 votes in Congress and made many overseas trips in luxurious accommodations He also said Mr Clay was lazy and arrogant Mr Clay said he voted on important issues in Congress but had refused to participate in what he considered nuisance votes on procedural matters On the question of luxury travel he said I always ride firstclass because Im a firstclass person Anyone whos secondclass shouldnt even be thinking about running for Congress On Sunday the day Mr Clay received the endorsement of Douglas A Fraser president of the United Automobile Workers Mr Mueller accused Mr Clay of owning two foreign cars Mr Clay denied the assertion This is the dirtiest campaign I have been in and today my opponent hit the pits he said He has blamed me because my two adult children own foreign automobiles If I am accountable for my two adult children then Al Mueller is responsible for the racist acts of his daddy Barny Mueller who sat on the Board of Aldermen a number of years and opposed every piece of civil rights legislation coming before it  Kansas Governor Faces Challenge By the Associated Press Gov John Carlins only challenge for the Democratic nomination for a second term as Governor in the Kansas primaries today comes from Jimmy D Montgomery a disk jockey The three main contenders for the Republican nomination are House Speaker Wendell Lady Sam Hardage a Wichita businessman and former Lieut Gov Dave Owen
No Friend of the Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/04/opinion/no-friend-of-the-court.html,The Reagan Justice Department filed a curious document with the Supreme Court last week in connection with pending abortion cases Though called a brief for the United States as a friend of the court it is in fact a 20page lecture The time has come to call a halt it says to the way the Court has been dealing with abortion disputes The document goes out of its way to disparage the Courts famous 1973 abortion decision Roe v Wade Then it goes on to urge the Court to uphold some of the nations most restrictive abortion regulations We trust that the Court which needs no such lecture will ignore this political tract for it is of scant help in deciding the complex cases to be heard in the fall term The brief is better suited to the partisan purposes of an Administration eager to appease its disgruntled right wing A Justice Department official demonstrated as much when he made sure that a Washington conference of abortion opponents was promptly notified of the filing Still even if the document persuades no justice it does harm One way is by trashing the departments reputation as a source of principled counsel to the Court With this brief Solicitor General Rex Lee has vented his deep personal quarrel with most of the Courts abortion decisions while distorting the function of his respected office Rarely has a Solicitor General intervened in a Supreme Court case without clearly identifying a strong Federal interest But Mr Lee concedes that Federal law is not implicated in the local abortion rules in the pending cases The Governments concern he says is in preserving the proper sphere of legislative action Thats just another way of saying to the Court get out Mr Lees brief puts simplistic zeal above intelligent analysis The cases involve a variety of narrow technical rules devised by the state of Missouri and the city of Akron Ohio The rules range from moderate to extreme One for instance requires a 24hour cooling off period following an abortion request A harsher regulation requires doctors to tell patients certain facts  such as that an unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception But Mr Lee is too busy peddling his personal views to distinguish between moderate and harsh He insists that the Court defer even to the most burdensome restrictions Only a few months ago the Justice Department took another amazing position in a dispute over a states duty to educate alien children Though it is Washingtons duty to control the borders there was no Federal interest the department said and thus no reason for it to take an interest Another Federal default occurred when the Administration refused to defend Internal Revenue Service rules against tax benefits for racist private schools On that occasion the Supreme Court felt compelled to call in an outsider as a special friend of the court In this case where there is no Federal interest the Justice Department rushes in to assert one Why not go the last step and spray antiabortion graffiti on the marble pillars
REAGAN CALLS ON CATHOLICS IN U.S. TO REJECT NUCLEAR FREEZE PROPOSAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/04/us/reagan-calls-on-catholics-in-us-to-reject-nuclear-freeze-proposal.html,President Reagan appealed to an audience of Roman Catholics today to reject the call for a nuclear weapons freeze that has won the backing of many Catholic bishops In a speech here at the centennial meeting of the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus the President said that the idea of a freeze on nuclear weapons was obsolete and sterile Instead he asked Americans to support his proposal for deep reductions in the nuclear warhead arsenals of both the Soviet Union and the United States A freeze might be fine  after weve had a complete removal of the most threatening intermediatebased missiles and deep reductions in the number of stratetic weapons verifiable reductions Mr Reagan said Subjects of Hierarchy Debate Both this issue and the nuclear freeze movement have become subjects of increasing debate within the Catholic hierarchy More than 100 of the nations Catholic bishops favor the nuclear freeze for example and many expect the bishops to issue a pastoral letter this fall endorsing the freeze concept Although the Presidents message echoed many of his previous comments his audience at the Hartford Civic Center was highly unusual It consisted of 8000 participants at the Knights of Columbus meeting and more than 150 highranking members of the hierarchy from the United States and around the world including eight cardinals Among the prelates was Agostino Cardinal Casaroli Secretary of State for the Vatican and Pope John Paul IIs personal representative at the convention who had lunch with Mr Reagan this afternoon Warm Response From Audience The audience applauded the President warmly especially when he repeated his positions in favor of antiabortion legislation and tax credits for families with children in private schools Mr Reagan also got a warm response for his call for a constitutional amendment permitting officially sanctioned school prayer and a plea for tougher statutes against obscenity Only mild applause came however when the President thanked his audience for the support he had received from the Knights of Columbus for the morality of maintaining our strategic deterrence Outside the Civic Center many of several hundred antiReagan demonstrators were carrying signs in favor of the freeze Inside a woman interrupted the Presidents speech with cries of No more nuclear weapons and Jobs for the poor before she was quietly escorted out by police officers Mr Reagan managed to turn the incident to his advantage when just before she was escorted out he said Every place I go these days theres an echo He was referring to a similar incident Monday in Des Moines and the quip brought a standing ovation A preliminary draft of the bishops profreeze statement is being prepared by a committee led by Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Chicago who was among those on the speakers platform with Mr Reagan here So far 133 bishops have endorsed the idea of a nuclear freeze Moreover the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is preparing a broad statement on the arms race that is expected to include a proposed ban on further testing and deployment of nuclear weapons FirstStrike Policy Condemned A preliminary draft of the statement prepared by a committee of five bishops headed by Archbishop Bernardin also condemns the first use of nuclear arms urges a ban on deployment of nuclear weapons against civilians and suggests steps toward disarmanent Liberal Catholics have criticized the statement as too weak while conservatives are uneasy with the churchs shift away from the historic theory of the just war that allows for a variety of defensive strategies Mr Reagan did not address himself to the debate within the Catholic hierarchy Rather he called attention to a debate expected this week on the floor of the House of Representatives over two resolutions relating to American nuclear policy One resolution already approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee with some Republican support endorses the freeze at current levels of SovietAmerican nuclear arsenals The President said this measure would leave in place dangerous inequalities in the nuclear balance and send a signal to the Soviet Union that we are willing to accept something less than reductions in nuclear warheads on both sides Urges Incentive to Soviet He called for approval of a separate resolution supporting his position which he said would act as an incentive to persuade the Soviet Union to agree to mutual reductions Mr Reagans comments were described by White House officials as part of what was planned as a major effort on the House floor in behalf of his nuclear policies Larry Speakes the deputy White House press secretary said the President was scheduled to meet Wednesday with a group of Republican and Democratic Congressmen supporting the Administrationbacked measure to demonstrate his interest and the importance of this issue Mr Reagan flew here this morning from Des Moines and spent about four hours in Connecticut before returning to Washington Although the trip was billed by his aides as a politically significant opportunity to appeal for support among Catholics especially in the Northeast the President did not mention anything about the gubernatorial or senatorial contests in this state where the Republicans are expected to have some difficulty The incumbent Senator in this years contest Lowell P Weicker Jr is a Republican and has the endorsement of the Connecticut Republican Party but he has had so many battles with the Administration over foreign and domestic matters that any sort of mutual endorsement by the President and Mr Weicker would be considered unusual Later today the Senator kept his distance from Mr Reagan even as he returned with him to Washington aboard Air Force One Asked what he thought of the Presidents speech Mr Weicker who was in the auditorium said Obviously I disagreed with the entire substance of it
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS: SCENES AT CENTENNIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/04/nyregion/knights-of-columbus-scenes-at-centennial.html,For 32 years the Rev James Roth has been the only priest in a church on the edge of the wheat fields in Voshton Kan There are 618 persons in the town and 56 families in his parish and it is eight miles to the next Roman Catholic church He baptizes all the babies performs all the weddings even picks the pesky ragweed out of the church cemetery During the July harvest he delivers grain to the elevator after the 730 AM mass Today Father Roth received holy communion from Agostino Cardinal Casaroli the envoy of Pope John Paul II in a mass attended by seven cardinals 140 archbishops 400 priests and 6000 participants The Knights of Columbus had come to Hartford for their convention which this year celebrated the fraternal orders 100th anniversary Turning the citys Civic Center from a hockey arena into a house of the Lord was merely one of the orders of business It is conceivable that more Catholics gathered under the same roof in March when the basketball teams and fans of four Catholic colleges Boston College Georgetown St Johns and Villanova  vied in the Big East tournament But the mood today was closer to unanimous and todays cast which included President Reagan was more lustrous I saw Babe Ruth initiated back when he was with the Red Sox said Joseph Kennedy who is 83 years old He was just starting to hit homers then and he was the toast of the town Mr Kennedy joined the Knights of Columbus in 1919 Daniel Fitzgerald the friend he was telling about Babe Ruth entered in the same year Mr Fitzgerald is now 84 and attending his 31st convention My first was Atlantic City Mr Fitzgerald said I think it was 39 Mine was Miami said Mr Kennedy What year was that Dan 40 I dont know Those dates get foggy in your mind Back then the Knights of Columbus existed largely to fight antiCatholic bigotry help widows and orphans and sell life insurance Anyone under 26 years old had to purchase a policy to become a member The monthly premium Mr Fitzgerald recalled was 26 cents and the coverage was 1000 That used to be a lot of money Mr Fitzgerald said That could bury you back then Now all they could do is give you to the rendering company for that Though the knights joust their historian Dr Christopher Kauffman said yesterday they do so infrequently and in private There have been a few battles Until 1946 no one who worked with liquor could join the Knights of Columbus the rule was reversed against the apocalyptic warnings of some clerics They feuded with President Franklin D Roosevelt about his refusal to condemn publicly an antiCatholic government in Mexico And in 1968 the convention rescinded the rule on members purchasing insurance But most often Dr Kauffman said the knights convene to celebrate their slogan of charity unity fraternity and patriotism  hardly a menu for controversy Nor do many knights dissent from the organizations list of legislation it would like to be enacted school prayer tuition tax credits and a ban on abortion But the appearance of President Reagan to endorse those measures led to the question of whether the organization likened itself to the Moral Majority The comparison makes many members grimace I just dont know how you can make that comparison said Jaqueline Grzelak of Jewett City Conn who of course is not a member of the fraternal order and was there with her husband Dont even try said her husband Walter The Moral Majority  theyre rabblerousers There was little sense of the stereotypical convention populated by husbands seeking a naughty time away from home If anything the knights occasionally made others feel guilty about having too good a time Yesterday afternoon three girls waited for an elevator in the Sheraton Hotel giggling and dripping from a swim The elevator opened and their smiles flattened They were facing five or six priests and the girls looked as if they had been caught pilfering the collection plate The knights obeyed Dont Walk signs even when there were no cars in sight Many brought rather than fled from their families All around were confirmations of their traditional view of home life One woman wore a name tag that said Rose Marie Parker Dons Better Half Another woman saw it and commented I have one that says Worthy Wife  A cookbook sold by the Connecticut delegation included a recipe for preserved children that involved sunshine open space and dogs Nearly 7000 people attended the convention and for hundreds from foreign

Arabia hotels here posted the foreign exchange rates for the currencies of a halfdozen countries Those who came great distances tempered their celebration and camaraderie with history Two busloads daily toured New Haven the site of the founding of the Knights of Columbus but a city without the hotel space to handle this convention Others drove to the gravesite in Waterbury of the Rev Michael J McGivney the founder The Knights of Columbus are trying to have Father McGivney declared a saint It is a prolonged process in which three miracles must be attributed to prayers by him and there is no certainty of success The Rev Gilbert Hermann of Ellinwood Kansas stood beside the grave yesterday He would take photographs of the grave back to Ellinwood for his parishioners Father McGivney is someone I feel some relation to he said and to come here makes me feel more a part of it The elevator in the Parkview Hilton Hotel opened on the seventh floor One smelled the mint before one saw the crowd The Kentucky delegations annual mint julep jubilee was attracting its usual throng This sure brings Kentucky and Oregon closer together said Gerard F Pranger a delegate from Hillsboro Ore But brotherhood does not always come easily Albin E Stoeckle the Kentucky state deputy recalled the disastrous San Diego convention when the fresh mint wilted in transit and the drinks reminded no one of

SUBTLE SHIFTS IN G.O.P. APPEALS AIMED AT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/05/us/subtle-shifts-in-gop-appeals-aimed-at-women.html,Republican candidates increasingly concerned about losing womens votes to Democrats are beginning to fight back with subtle shifts in their appeals to voters They are emphasizing issues that are not inherently sexrelated but seem to matter more to women than to men and they are showing more women in their television advertisements In Illinois the advertisements of Gov James R Thompson show a middleaged woman praising a program of inhome nursing that helps her 85yearold mother In Indiana Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas is pointedly included in a series of televised tributes to Senator Richard G Lugar In Delaware Representative Thomas B Evans Jr sends out a mailing to women under the age of 40 on issues ranging from pay equality to mortgages to Social Security The candidates advisers are looking at polls that often though not always show Republican candidates doing several percentage points worse among women than men They are trying to control the damage often without taking on feminist issues such as the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution and always without dealing with President Reagan and his responsibility in their eyes for the political difference between the sexes Each race has its own numbers but typical of national polls was the finding of The New York TimesCBS News Poll in May that 42 percent of men but only 34 percent of women said they would vote for a Congressional candidate who supported Mr Reagans policies Limits Seen to Strategies Republican strategists like Robert M Teeter a leading poll taker and John Deardourff a highly regarded maker of television commercials say there are limits to what individual Republicans can do about the sex gap because it began with womens perceptions of Mr Reagan and his agenda and their fears that he is too willing to risk war But they and others are trying although many Republican races are not touched by the efforts Indeed Kathy Wilson the disaffected Republican who is chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus scoffs at the attempts It doesnt seem to me that politics has changed that much she said There are still all those commercials of men talking to men sitting on tractors She said she did not expect any fundamental change in campaigning until after this years election when politicians see that women had an impact But some candidates and managers have decided that they would just as soon have somebody else be the Republican loser whose race showed the impact of women From them have come two kinds of responses Indirect Approaches to Women The most common are indirect Mr Teeter says that some approaches involve efforts to reach more women through special mailings or advertisements on daytime television so they know more about you than they do about the other guy Robert Goodman another leading television commercial maker has a spot for Brooks Patterson a District Attorney seeking the Republican nomination for Governor in Michigan It shows Mr Patterson on the way to the courthouse accompanied by aides including a woman who is a lawyer The unstated message he says is that in a Patterson administration women are part of the action Or there is Mr Deardourffs commercial for Mr Thompson An announcer says Mr Thompson is responsible for the most extensive inhome nursing program in the nation while a nurse checks the blood pressure of an elderly woman The picture shifts to mother and daughter on a couch and the daughter says My mother is 85 years old and she is a diabetic arthritic and with a heart condition Then as the mother fixes some food in a kitchen the daughter says With Governor Thompson having this program shes able to stay in her own home and she doesnt have to go to a convalescent home Issues That Cut With Women Other topics used in commercials that take this tack focus on education or the environment or drunken driving and many other issues that relate to children These are subjects that Mr Teeter describes as not inherently womens issues but issues that have uniquely cut with women In Illinois James Edgar the Secretary of State is the only statewide Republican candidate running as strongly with women as with men his efforts to penalize drunken drivers are given the credit Some campaigns do take up feminist concerns more directly Mrs Wilson observed that Senator John Danforth of Missouri who had opposed extension of the ratification period for the equal rights amendment was now proclaiming his support for another attempt to enact the measure And in a special election for a state senate seat in New Jersey Assemblyman Bill Gormley is urging the State Civil Service Commission to look into reclassifying jobs to achieve one key goal of feminist organizations equal pay for jobs of equal value Mr Gormley like Mr Evans is being advised by Roger Stone a Washington consultant But indirect appeals at least for mass advertising are more common The reason is a belief that economic concerns and to a lesser degree fears of war are what is hurting Republican support among women especially single women As one Republican strategist here advises Dont go on a rabbit hunt based on ERA and abortion Reagan Poll Taker Admits Worry Mr Reagans poll taker Richard B Wirthlin said his polls made him quite worried about the sex gaps threat to Republicans He said he believed the effect would show up most clearly this year in House races where candidates are often not well

Senators Plan Debate On Antiabortion Bills,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/07/us/senators-plan-debate-on-antiabortion-bills.html,The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr gave foes of liberal abortion rules a parliamentary victory and perhaps averted a liberal filibuster by arranging an agreement for a Senate debate and vote on two antiabortion measures A Senate Republican source said Thursday that under the agreement the Senate would debate and vote probably within two weeks on a bill sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms to declare that life begins at conception and to ban Federal financing for anything connected with abortion The accord also calls for a debate and vote on a constitutional amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch to give Congress and the states the right to restrict abortions Senator Mark O Hatfields proposal for a permanent ban on Federal financing of abortions and for a review of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion was laid aside in the agreement Mr Baker a Tennessee Republican told reporters he had conferred with senators on both sides of the issue The source said all Republicans involved had agreed to the proposal They included Mr Helms of North Carolina Mr Hatch of Utah Mr Hatfield of Oregon and two Senators who support the right to abortion Bob Packwood of Oregon and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut The proposal has yet to get the support of the Democratic side The source said the agreement gave Mr Baker a measure of control over the debate and let the liberals retain their ability to filibuster later on the entire bill if they chose The agreement provides that the Helms bill be debated eight hours Then the Hatch amendment would be debated for a specified time and voted on Then the Helms bill would be voted on
CANDIDATES AGREE ON WOMEN'S ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/candidates-agree-on-women-s-issues.html,In separate discussions yesterday with a gathering of womens rights leaders Mayor Koch and Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo outlined essentially similar positions on womens issues but were divided on a range of other topics from the economy to real estate Mr Koch and Mr Cuomo who are seeking the Democratic nomination for governor each spoke for about 15 minutes before answering questions about their views on abortion affirmative action unemployment child care joint custody and other issues the audience of about 100 considered especially significant to women The meetings were sponsored by the Manhattan Womens Political Caucus at the YWCA at 52d Street and Lexington Avenue In his statement Mr Koch praised his administrations record on womens issues Mr Cuomo in his opening remarks attacked his opponent as no longer a traditional Democrat saying Mr Koch had supported realestate interests and had acquiesced to the new federalism of the Reagan Administration I dont accept the proposition uttered by President Reagan and Mayor Koch that if you take care of the rich theyll take care of you Mr Cuomo said Simply a Reaffirmation Mr Koch asked the leaders for their groups endorsements saying This is important to me because its simply a reaffirmation that we are together as we have been together since the day I first took office He said that during his tenure as Mayor he had appointed women to top posts increased the percentage of women hired and promoted established disciplinary procedures regarding sexual harassment supported financing for day care centers and instituted flexible working hours In addition Mr Koch defended the citys tax abatement program for real estate development and condemned a proposal to extend rent controls He said the city had spent 300 million to take over apartment buildings that had been abandoned because landlords could not make a profit How long do you think that we can go on  he asked before we have to cut into funds that you want for other programs Both candidates said they would oppose any bills restricting the right of women to choose whether or not to have abortions as well as legislation requiring parental consent for abortions performed on minors Personal Views Irrelevant At one point in the twoandahalfhour discussion a member of the audience suggested that Mr Cuomo had made statements critical of abortion and homosexuality Mr Cuomo replied that his personal views on abortion had become irrelevant after the United States Supreme Court upheld womens rights to abortion Since that time he said I have fought harder than anybody to insure that abortions are available to women regardless of their income Since 1974 when I first entered public life Mr Cuomo said I have not changed my position one iota If you can find a single time I contradicted myself Ill come to you and publicly apologize and you can make a commercial out of it Both candidates also pledged to appropriate funds for day care senior citizen and job training programs and to enforce existing legislation outlawing sex discrimination and promoting affirmative action They both said they were unsure about a bill that would tax marriage licenses to provide funds for battered spouses although each condemned domestic violence Different Strategies When asked what steps they would take to promote affirmative action and combat unemployment the candidates offered different strategies Mr Koch stressed job training and New Yorks resources Calling himself a supersalesman he said that if elected I will bring my intelligence and energy to attract jobs here Mr Cuomo proposed extending the length of time workers would receive unemployment benefits raising the amount of unemployment compensation and creating new jobs in the areas of service high technology fishing and manufacturing Mr Koch pledged his support for a state and Federal equal rights amendment saying that it was obscene that the Empire State doesnt have such legislation Mr Cuomo said he would appoint a woman to the Court of Appeals the states highest court and would issue an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals

resemble Unlike Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton she keeps her demons bridled Unlike Elizabeth Bishop or May Swenson she is bawdily personal Like Adrienne Rich she makes us pay respectful attention to images of strong female identity yet she avoids ideology And is there another poet who finds or invents such a sweet male alter ego Henry Manley the country neighbor who is one of several recurring figures in Our Ground Time Here Will Be Brief could be the most endearing animus in the business Last fall he dug a hole and moved his privy  and a year ago in April reamed his well out though in his dotage Having had a phone installed he tramps two New England miles shy as a girl to ask the poet if shed be so kind as to call him one day Stricken with aphasia Manley is as loose in his skin as a puppy and frightened after dark But at dawn he gets up grateful once more for how coffee smells Sits stiff at the bruised porcelain table saying them over able to with only the slightest catch Coffee Coffee cup Watch Typical of Maxine Kumins art are the sensory weight the play of alliteration and assonance sliding into the closing couplets the perfectly expressive halting and crystallizing rhythms In another poem Henry breaks his hip is taken in by neighbors loves his new role of storytelling sage When he goes on crutches to see his old collapsing house presently occupied by porcupines he says You cant look back Mirroring his creator Henry Manley is a supervisor a capable countryperson of multiple skills He will die before the poet does and he is one of her many means of studying mortality He is also what she is not or can be only through him an isole He is alone not looking back For her not looking back would be intolerable Our Ground Time Here Will Be Brief contains selections from Maxine Kumins first six volumes as well as 29 new poems all but one of them gems the book amounts to 20 years solid work Her Pulitzer Prizewinning Up Country comes just about halfway both in chronology and in power rather like Frosts imagined wanderer to the edge of doom she is not changed only more sure  so that her poems become increasingly unforgettable indispensable What drives her throughout is attachment If she had her way no loved or hated human or animal would die unremembered Thus she writes not only the usual kinfolk poems but Sperm a tragicomic celebration of 17 lookalike cousins Since dreams reinforce memory and reveal the true shape of connection in The Incest Dream a sorrowing hangman brings her beloved dying brothers severed penis pressed as faithfully  as a wild flower for the poet to keep and lie back down in my lucky shame When the brother has died Retrospect in the Kitchen tells of the 40 pounds of plums she takes from his tree and carries 3000 miles to preserve The making of preserves is a recurring image in these poems and a beautiful metaphor for what the poet wants to do with the whole world Other tricks also work People fade but animals retrieve them Ponies begging for apples equal two elderly aunts a boy once loved buried at sea in World War II reappears in a yearlings gallop To split wood is to release the soul of the beech and recall the soul of the lost friend Anne Sexton Children especially daughters keep cropping up growing as they go from Mrs Kumins earliest work to her most recent No poet writes more richly and more subtly of motherdaughter relations Or for that matter of animalhuman relations since her attachment and attention extend to the forms and gestures the detailed lives and deaths of mice turtles frogs goats beavers cows and calves sheep and lambs and  most powerfully  horses Creatures surround her she sees and touches them she foresees their doom At times  see Woodchucks or How It Goes On  she is their dooms guilty agent At times  see Thinking of Death and Dogfood or A Mortal Day of No Surprises  she contemplates the uses of horseflesh and her own potential to sweeten a crop and wishes her mare and herself good endings I believe that Thoreau would commend her honesty the precision of her language and her occasional moral allegory Maxine Kumin has been Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress and the one occasional poem arising from her tenure is a somewhat uncomfortable meditation on literature and history Like the single wrong bead in a Hopi necklace the comparative shapelessness of this poem accents the compact rightness of the rest My one other complaint about this volume is that the selections from earlier books are in reverse chronological order What prankster decided to run the movie backward BESIDES the poetry by which she is best known Mrs Kumin writes charming childrens books and good readable fiction Her four novels thick with human physicality and human decency like her poems tend to concentrate on sex and love This is also the case in her first collection of stories Why Cant We Live Together Like Civilized Human Beings The narrator of the title story a documentary film maker who meets and loves a colleague at a film festival behind the Iron Curtain answers the titles question to her own unhappy satisfaction by believing in the infinite depravity of man Another answer is that love sustains civilized individuals only intermittently Almost all of Mrs Kumins protagonists are reasonable people in middle life enduring situations they do not quite choose A womans prim and inhibited mother is dying while her bright young daughter who plays a game called abortion grows breasts and gleefully approaches menstruation A shy professor of mycology has a twoday romance with a dancer A girl who grew up in the lower middle class has a love affair during a visit to a friend who grew up rich and is now living in Vermont joyously married and a veteran of noble causes but who is dying of cancer Another woman meets and is humiliated by a man who was her adolescent necking partner A couple whose son went down in a helicopter in Vietnam drives 370 miles to Boston to see his widow On a Boston street corner the dead boys father Alan vanishes and his wife suffers a halfcrazed night In the morning she informs the police that he is a missing person and begins her drive home in a state of strange euphoria She has survived her ordeal  she has coped She has conquered the subway  She reviews the extreme and contradictory emotions the sight of Alans dead wellknown body will arouse in her High violence and high passion take place offstage in these stories though never far offstage Maxine Kumins writing emanates from the bodies of her characters delivering their senses and sense together as a poets writing should and invites us to recognize our destinies in theirs The Envelope By Maxine Kumin It is true Martin Heidegger as you have written I fear to cease even knowing that at the hour of my death my daughters will absorb me even knowing they will carry me about forever inside them an arrested fetus even as I carry the ghost of my mother under my navel a nervy little androgynous person a miracle folded in lotus position Like those old pearshaped Russian dolls that open at the middle to reveal another and another down to the peasized irreducible minim may we carry our mothers forth in our bellies May we borne onward by our daughters ride in the Envelope of AlmostInfinity that chain

Politics; REAGAN RAISES G.O.P. HACKLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/politics-reagan-raises-gop-hackles.html,HARTFORD President Reagan was back in Connecticut on Tuesday for his first visit since his election addressing a cheering crowd of 7000 in the Civic Center Coliseum But for the most part he was not sharing the cheers or his popularity with other members of his party Ralph E Capecelatro the Republican state chairman was in Hartford that day but not at the Coliseum I was at Republican headquarters trying to get Republicans elected said Mr Capecelatro a touch of irritation in his voice One of the candidates Mr Capecelatro was helping  Lewis B Rome the partys nominee for Governor  also did not see President Reagan Mr Reagan spent about four hours in the state with no time scheduled for Republican officeseekers and Mr Rome had not been formally asked to be present as the President spoke at a convention of the Knights of Columbus He did get a lastminute invitation however from United States Representative Lawrence J DeNardis Republican of Hamden who had been invited with his wife Mary and had an extra ticket because she could not attend I talked to Lew this morning about it Mr DeNardis said Tuesday I invited him to come with me But since the advance preparations were not made he did not want any embarassing security problems John J Cunnane Jr a Republican City Councilman in Hartford was so annoyed by the haste of the Reagan foray into Connecticut and his inability to see the President just for a second that he had in mind security problems of a different type In a fit of pique he suggested that the Hartford police be withdrawn from traffic control duties around the President suggesting that the police let him thrash his way through the city Mr Cunnane was further annoyed that he got his invitation to the event from a Democrat Hartfords Mayor Thirman Milner He stayed away Governor ONeill the Democratic incumbent attended Im here as a guest of the Knights of Columbus he said Intentionally or otherwise the Presidents brevity offended some members of the local party hierarchy I asked the Whte House to consider a photo session at the very least for my candidate for Governor Lew Rome or a brief fundraising thing said Mr Capecelatro I guess I got as much when Carter came through as when Reagan did The White House itself was terse on the subject Peter Roussell a deputy press secretary said The purpose of being here was nonpolitical Stopping for a fiveminute photo session with local candidates wasnt even an option he said because we were here for a limited amount of time and we had this commitment to do this event The event itself was a halfhour speech to mark the centennial meeting of the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus the Roman Catholic fraternal organization which was founded in New Haven The President touched on a number of subjects supporting a tax credit for private education and a ban on abortions among other things He also mentioned the Ku Klux Klan which the Knights of Columbus have long opposed but he made no mention of Connecticuts recent struggles with that organization He really missed a good political opportunity to express a concern that many of the minorities in this state have said Mr Cunnane the Hartford City Councilman Sometimes Republicans just shoot themselves in the foot Its unfortunate But Mr DeNardis who listened to the speech from the front row disagreed This is not even a Connecticut function he said Its an international convention that happens to be in the State of Connecticut The other Republican officeholder in attendance Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr also played down the absence of a local focus in the event I dont think in any way this is a snub of Lew Rome he said I wouldnt read anything into it Mr Romes press secretary Tom Sweeney said There are a number of policies at the White House which make it difficult if not impossible for the President to have anything to do with Lew during this visit Lew understands those and was not bothered by it Mr Sweeney was referring to a policy under which if Mr Reagan were to mix politics with business on the trip the Republican National Committee would have had to help pay for it However Mr Roussel said he had not heard of any such problem It was Mr DeNardis and Mr Weicker  who of the Republican candidates are perhaps the two least in need of additional publicity  who spent the longest time with the President accepting Mr Reagans invitation of a ride back to Washington on Air Force One Mr Weicker is often at odds with the President and said on Tuesday that he was 100 percent in disagreement with the content of what is being said here But he accepted the Presidents invitation for a ride back to Washington on Air Force One Politics should be practiced with civility he said adding that he thought it showed respect for the President to accept the invitation Although he disagreed with the points raised by the President Mr Weicker said he did not mention the subject while he was on the plane He recalled that the last time he had been on Air Force One he was with former President Jimmy Carter and that he was criticized then for making the prediction on the plane that Mr Carter would be beaten in the Connecticut Presidential primary by Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts

STRONG WOMAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/books/strong-woman.html,CIRCLES ON THE WATER Selected Poems By Marge Piercy 299 pp New York Alfred A Knopf Cloth 1750 Paper 895 THIS selection of Marge Piercys poems is gathered from 20 years of poetry and includes poems from seven books Just cause for jubilation since anyone who can survive 20 years of serious poetry writing in America right now deserves a medal of some sort Also for retrospection For those of Miss Piercys age this book will read like a cross section of their own archeology for perhaps no other poet of this generation has more consistently identified herself with the political and social movements of her own times Her earlier involvements were with the civilrights and antiwar movements of the 60s which generated in turn the womensrights and antiwar movements of the 70s For anyone interested in whats been happening on the cutting edge during the past two decades shes clearly essential reading Miss Piercy has the double vision of the utopian a view of human possibility  harmony between the sexes among races and between humankind and nature  that makes the present state of affairs clearly unacceptable by comparison The huge discrepancy between what is and what could be generates anger and many of these are angry poems  which for those who want poetry to be nothing but beautiful will mean points off Because her poetry is so deliberately political  which for some means anything not about ghosts and roses  how you feel about it will depend on how you feel about subjects such as malefemale relations abortion war and poverty Those who dont like these subjects will use adjectives like shrill to describe the poems Its only during certain phases of American intellectual history that divisions are made between poetry and politics however as Miss Piercy herself points out in her rather disarming introduction the gap would not have been recognized by Sophocles Virgil Catullus Chaucer Dryden Wordsworth Shelley Arnold Whitman Blake Goethe As Miss Piercy also points out her poetry is both personal  that is it has the recognizable speaking voice of an individual human being not a voice issuing from behind a vatic ceremonial mask  and public meaning both that it addresses itself to public issues and that it is for a public With some of these poems one can almost hear not only the reading voice but the murmurs of response and the spontaneous applause at appropriate rhetorical moments Taken as a whole and I recommend you do so only slowly as this is rich fare  this collection presents the spectacle of an agile and passionate mind rooted firmly in time and place and engaging itself with the central dilemmas of its situation How for instance is a heterosexual feminist to respond to a men as they are and b more extreme feminists who want her to divest herself of them How is a socialist to comport herself in a country that provides her with at best a marginal constituency How is a poet to speak for the people when she knows that poetry readers come mainly from the middle classes Sometimes Miss Piercys is a bewildered and lonely voice albeit a voice that admits to such quailings Her position has not been an easy or sheltered one As she says a strong woman is a woman strongly afraid If poets could be divided into Prioresses and Wives of Bath Miss Piercy would very definitely be a Wife of Bath Low on fastidiousness and high on what Hazlitt called gusto earthy bawdy interested in the dailiness of life rather than in metaphysics highly conscious of the power relationships between men and women but seeing herself by no means as a passive victim she is ready to enter the fray with every weapon at her command She is in sum a celebrant of the body in all its phases including those that used to be thought of as vulgar Surprisingly her poetry is more humorous than her novels although not all of it is what youd call funny The Wife of Bath was sometimes a savage ironist and so is Miss Piercy Neither has much interest in being ladylike Many of these poems are driven forward by a ferocious energy Watching Miss Piercy attack a poem attack in the musical sense  is frequently like watching a very hungry person attack a steak To hell with the niceties and if theres no knife handy use your fingers and teeth The poem speeds ahead on the roller skates of its own statement hardly stopping to breathe and accumulating figures of speech like burrs like ticker tape like passengers waiting for a train that wont slow down for them like scars on a boxer like this sentence and many times it works overwhelming the reader with the strength of cumulative suggestion and sometimes you feel youve ended up in a bowl of alphabet soup Examples of the former abound for the latter try the first two verses of Martha as the angel Gabriel in which the subject is compared within 13 lines to a tugboat an engine a bulldog butterfly a koala bear and a swallow In her own words since there is very little one can say about Miss Piercy that she hasnt said about herself I lack a light touch I step on my own words  a garden rake in the weeds  I am earnest into sermons when I should slip away I ram on The pattern condensed here  criticism and selfdoubt the poet as clumsy blunderer followed however by an absolute determination not to quit  knits itself into her work over and over in many variations MISS PIERCY would not have found favor with most creativewriting instructors had she ever taken any such classes Tidiness is not her virtue but then in the hierarchy of virtues this is surely not at the top Essentially her poetry is a poetry of statement and story and metaphor and simile are characteristically used by her as illustration rather than as structural principle This does not bother me very much since its a mistake for a reader to look for the same qualities in every poet Miss Piercys emotional range is great and at her best she can make you laugh cry get angry she can inspire you with social purpose and open doors through which you may walk into lived reality One effect she almost never achieves because she almost never tries for it is that touch of the cold hand at the back of the neck that glimpse into the borderlands The darkness she sees is humancreated and therefore potentially correctable not that other darkness evoked by Rilkes Duino Elegies for instance Miss Piercys scale even in her nature poems which are more likely to be about zucchini and lettuces and compost heaps than tigers and loons is human and encompasses all the grandeur and trivia that scale demands The sublime and the infernal for her are situated in the here and now In a collection with so many high points its difficult to single out one or two But for me Miss Piercy in top form and who should not be judged by her best is to be found in Crescent moon like a canoe a sad courageous and moving poem that is not only about her own mother but about her own motives for poetry This is poetry both wide open and fully controlled flexible tender clearsighted and compassionate an act of forgiveness Miss Piercy is finally a hopeful poet but its a hope that has been long and bitterly fought for Circles on the Water concludes with seven new poems which end the book on an oddly tentative note This too is no doubt intentional an indication that the poet is happily not finished not yet Long may she continue to celebrate and learn Whats that smell in the kitchen By Marge Piercy All over America women are burning dinners Its lambchops in Peoria its haddock in Providence its steak in Chicago tofu delight in Big Sur red rice and beans in Dallas All over America women are burning food theyre supposed to bring with calico smile on platters glittering like wax Anger sputters in her brainpan confined but spewing out missiles of hot fat Carbonized despair presses like a clinker from a barbecue against the back of her eyes If she wants to grill anything its her husband spitted over a slow fire If she wants to serve him anything its a dead rat with a bomb in its belly ticking like the heart of an insomniac Her life is cooked and digested nothing but leftovers in Tupperware Look she says once I was roast duck on your platter with parsley but now I am Spam Burning dinner is not incompetence but war

ABORTION BRIEF SERVES AS ROAD MAP,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/10/us/abortion-brief-serves-as-road-map.html,When the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court recently to give heavy deference to the desire of state and local politicians to restrict access to abortion it did more than make a surprising lastminute entry in two pending abortion cases that had not previously involved the Federal Government at all The brief the department filed is also a forceful expression perhaps the strongest to date of the Reagan Administrations view that a courts role in weighing the constitutionality of legislative action should be essentially passive The brief attacks what it calls constitutionalization saying that Federal courts have gone overboard in transforming issues of policy into constitutional rights Once a court constitutionalizes a question such as abortion the brief says it removes that question from the legislative domain where it belongs and eliminates all but one of the competing points of view as acceptable alternatives When a court overrides a legislative effort to restrict abortion the brief says those who succeeded in persuading the legislature of the soundness of their policy viewpoint are deprived of their legislative victory whereas the legislative losers become the winners  all as the result of overeager constitutionalization Since the two sides will never agree on abortion the brief continues a court should not try to choose between them but should accord heavy deference to the legislative judgment While the departments focus is on abortion it concedes that its analysis is not limited to that subject The brief is essentially a roadmap to the Administrations constitutional vision It is in some respects a radical vision profoundly at odds with decades of development in constitutional law that have stressed the primacy of the courts in interpreting the Constitution Akron and Missouri Cases Had the Justice Department simply asked the Court to overrule Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that declared the right to have an abortion to be constitutionally protected the brief ironically would have been less startling But the department did not do that  not because it told the Justices it agrees with Roe v Wade but because the question of overruling that decision is not before the Court Rather the brief acknowledges albeit grudgingly the fact that Roe v Wade is binding constitutional law and then tells the Court that state and local legislators rather than judges should be left to decide as a matter of policy how the ruling should be enforced The cases now before the Court involve efforts by the city council in Akron Ohio and the Missouri state legislature to place various obstacles in the way of obtaining an abortion A Federal appeals court struck down Missouris requirement that all abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy be performed in hospitals Another Federal appeals court declared unconstitutional Akrons law requiring a physician to warn a patient that an abortion can result in severe emotional disturbances to tell her that the fetus is a human life from the moment of conception and to make her wait for the abortion at least 24 hours after the initial request The Justice Departments brief in support of Akron and Missouri does not argue explicitly that their laws are constitutional Rather it says that the lower courts were wrong in deciding for themselves that the laws went too far in limiting access to abortion The decision of whether a law imposes an undue burden on the exercise of the constitutional right the brief says is for the lawmakers themselves to make with only perfunctory review by the courts Jurisdictional Overlap Since the two sides will never agree the brief says some governmental entity must make a choice between the two competing positions In our democratic society the governmental body with the primary authority and responsibility to resolve competing policy views and pressures among citizens is the legislature In the abortion context as in many others legislation consists of selecting one set of competing private interests over another The abortion controversy the brief says is one of a number of disputes that theoretically can be resolved by either the legislature or the courts This area of overlap between the two jurisdictions it continues involves issues on which peoples views may differ mightily and the tilt should be toward permitting elected legislators to make the ultimate choice The best way to determine who is right and who is wrong on those issues is to permit and encourage the opposing sides to exercise their persuasive efforts on state legislators the brief says noting that just such a process is taking place with regard to abortion In each instance the representatives of the people  who must answer to the people for what they do  have considered the peoples competing viewpoints and have made the difficult choices required by the legislative process From state to state and from issue to issue some have won and some have lost Prochoice advocates have persuaded some legislatures on parental notification issues but not on hospitalization prolife proponents have won the informed consent debate in one state and lost it in another This is as it should be the brief concludes One of the fundamental postulates undergirding a free and open democratic society is that the search for truth is enhanced by permitting a full and uninhibited discussion of public issues Necessarily such a discussion is more effective if the ultimate resolution of the issue has not been removed from the realm of public debate and resolution through constitutional determination Solicitor Generals Book The brief was initiated and largely written by Solicitor General Rex E Lee the Justice Department official who represents the Federal Government before the Supreme Court The analysis closely tracks one in a book that Mr Lee wrote while he was dean of the law school at Brigham Young University In that book A Lawyer Looks at the Constitution published last year by the Brigham Young University Press Mr Lee cited Roe v Wade as an example of the Supreme Courts improper judicial intrusions into fundamental policy decisions that ought to be left to the legislature William French Smith the Attorney General struck a similar theme in a speech last fall when he said that the Administrations goal was to bring an end to constitutionally dubious and unwise intrusions upon the legislative domain by the Federal courts Despite their rhetoric the Administrations top legal officers have not been particularly successful in getting the courts to reverse direction in fact the Supreme Court rebuffed the Administration rather sharply in several of the recent terms most important cases Recently the politically conservative weekly Human Events attacked Mr Lee for what it called his timid and disappointing track record to date and published a list of his misdeeds purporting to show how he had disregarded the interests of conservatives and the President The list included cases in which the Justice Department had either filed no brief or taken positions in defense of Federal laws that were consistent with the positions of past administrations Mr Lee who was then deciding whether to go ahead with the abortion brief was said to have been stung by the criticism
CHINA OPENS ITS DOORS TO SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/10/world/china-opens-its-doors-to-southeast-asian-refugees.html,Vivid red flame trees blossom among the teak and eucalyptus in the valley of Ganba tucked 2700 feet high in the rugged green mountains of southern Yunnan Province The isolated valley situated 45 miles north of Chinas border with Vietnam and Laos has also sprouted settlements of Vietnamese refugees who have been put to work growing and cutting sugar cane for a refinery on the sprawling Ganzhuang state farm The refugees often homesick or restless are among 265000 Indochinese resettled by China usually in staterun farm and fishing communities China ranks only behind the United States among countries that opened their doors to refugees from Indochina The United States has resettled more than half a million such refugees China has accepted refugees even as other Asian countries keep turning them away There are now 105000 in Guangdong 100000 in Guangxi 40000 in Yunnan and 20000 in Fujian Province 85 Are of Chinese Descent Jacques Mouchet the Pekingbased representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 85 percent of these are of ethnic Chinese descent with the rest being Vietnamese and various Southeast Asian minorities The refugees flooded overland into China starting four years ago after most were expelled from Vietnam because they were of Chinese descent Instead of placing them in refugee camps China tried to disperse them to state farms During a visit to Peking last September Poul Hartling the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees praised Chinas response as unique in Asia But at least some want to move on ostensibly to join relatives more comfortably settled in the West but also because they dislike the bleak rural life ideological constraints and spartan conditions in China 5000 Have Asked to Leave China Hundreds of refugees tried sneaking through Canton into Hong Kong and Macao as illegal immigrants until the authorities there started repatriating them back to China They are no longer considered refugees once they have lived in China for six months At least 5000 have asked about joining relatives in the West About 700 have been allowed to leave China to do so Reunions are permitted only for immediate family members The Ganzhuang state farm which was set up as a home for returning overseas Chinese previously absorbed 1500 ethnic Chinese who were expelled from Indonesia in 1968 The farm now has another 1248 refugees from Indochina It happened so suddenly that we were not prepared recalled Li Mugui the state farms party secretary A directive from the Government came quickly down to us to take the refugees They came here with nothing at all We issued them farm tools and even their bowls and chopsticks Mr Li said that many of the refugees were farmers who knew how to grow sugar cane If they dont know we teach them and then they have to do it he added Monthly Wage of 32 In one such hamlet of small row houses 287 of the refugees now live while they work the adjacent canefields Hu Yingming the state farms deputy director reported that they drew a monthly wage of about 32 including bonuses and subsidies This would be a good farm wage in China though less than some refugees would have earned back in Vietnam Ling Wenxing the deputy leader of a production team used to own a small coffeehouse in Vietnam before he was hustled onto a train with his wife and two children and expelled across the border A third child has since been born in China All we could bring with us was the clothes on our backs and our children recalled Mr Ling sitting on a bench in his small tworoom home It was very sad Everything we brought along was taken away by the Vietnamese security men at the border His new village includes some farmers but most like Mr Ling were urban Vietnamese including factory workers from Hanoi Two ethnic Chinese from Ho Chi Minh City were recently transferred to another production team Mr Ling who is 42 years old declared that he was now eating better than he had back in Vietnam But he said his Vietnamese wife was still homesick and he implied that others were unhappy as well Lots of Problems Some have brothers or sisters or parents in foreign countries like America or England and would like to be reunited with them Mr Ling said Even I have applied to move out to England because my sisterinlaw and aunt live there He produced a worn letter with a London postmark If conditions permit we will move out Mr Ling told two reporters as Chinese officials listened to the conversation Otherwise we will stay here We have had to admit that we met lots of problems absorbing them Li Mugui the party secretary acknowledged But the office for overseas Chinese affairs allocated about a million yuan to this farm for production subsidies and refugee assistance One million yuan is slightly more than 500000 at the current exchange rate Mr Li said that the farm offered school classes even for some adults because they lost their education back home Material in Vietnamese was provided for political study sessions There were also classes in standard Chinese because the refugees speak only Vietnamese or Cantonese The local hospital director Li Huaxian complained that the refugees balked at the Governments strict birth control program They dont like abortions at all Mr Li said They want to produce a child in China as a souvenir During Chinas brief but fierce border war with Vietnam in early 1979 50 refugees on the farm volunteered to join the Chinese armed forces and one has remained in the army Li Mugui said Mr Ling said he joined the army as an interpreter during the border war The refugees at Ganba learned of the plight of the Vietnamese boat people from Vietnameselanguage broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation
ORGANIZED LABOR FACES AN UNCERTAIN ELECTION YEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/us/organized-labor-faces-an-uncertain-election-year.html,With unemployment at the highest level since the start of World War II with the rate of business failures at a 50year high and with interest rates still choking commerce in many cities and most small towns this should be the year if history is a reliable guide that organized labor reasserts itself as a major political force But with three months left before the November elections leaders of the major unions say they are still not sure whether they can elect a sympathetic Congress and force a hostile White House to pay more attention to labors many problems They question how much they can widen the Democratic margin in the House and whether with so many more Democratic Senators up for reelection than Republicans unhappy union members can change the party alignment in the Republicancontrolled Senate by any more than two seats The leaders say two factors are causing this hesitation The Republicans will be able to outspend laborbacked candidates by 10 to 1 in many Congressional districts and labors own midsummer polls show that many voters do not closely associate President Reagan with the recession 1980 Election a Disaster The 1980 elections it is agreed were a disaster for organized labor Most of the major unions reluctantly endorsed Jimmy Carter for a second term But 43 percent of the households with union members voted for Ronald Reagan enough for him to win in many labor states and enough to help defeat many liberal Democrats who had been among the best friends labor had in Congress The Republicans ended up with a 53to47 majority in the Senate controlling that body for the first time since the Eisenhower sweep of 1952 Nine of the Senate races were decided by 2 percent of the vote or less and seven of those close contests were won by Republicans with the help of union votes The Democrats lost 33 seats in the House leaving them with a precarious margin of 243 to 192 Mr Reagan as far as most union leaders are concerned has done little that is right since his inauguration and their relations with the White House are perhaps the worst since the days of Herbert Hoover The 15millionmember AFLCIO whose 99 unions include virtually all of this countrys major labor organizations is technically nonpartizan But the federations leaders are unanimous in believing that the only way they can now regain their former influence in Washington is to elect more Democrats to Congress this fall and return the White House to a Democrat in 1984 Latest Computerized Techniques In the past year the labor federations political arm the Committee on Political Education known as COPE has been reorganized It has been given a new director and provided with the latest computerized techniques for profiling union voters and making personal mailings to union members tailored to help them concentrate on issues of particular interest in their districts It has also stepped up its fundraising drive Last week with a long view toward 1984 the AFLCIOs executive council agreed to try for the first time in the federations history to endorse a Democratic candidate even before the primaries begin In the shorter view the federations political education committee is completing its voter surveys and polling of union households as it decides on the eight or 10 states where it expects to concentrate its efforts and money this fall Historically in the second year of a Presidents term the party in the White House has an average loss of 15 House seats In a Presidents sixth year the average loss has been 57 seats Impact of Republican Spending Because of redistricting or retirement about 50 House seats will be open this fall without an incumbent And according to John Perkins COPEs new director the AFLCIO will be very active in some districts where labor has never before tried very hard Currently the political education committee has found that between 20 and 25 percent of union members are registered Republicans Even including these our surveys show that Reagans job rating is now lower in union households than among the general public Mr Perkins said recently These polls also show that many union households that supported him in 1984 are not going to vote for Republican Congressional candidates in the same proportion this fall Were finding that in most states 60 percent of the households with union members say they will support the COPEbacked candidates in their district But this could be offset Mr Perkins said by Republican spending which he believes could exceed 400000 each by Republican candidates in close races Reagan Support Continues The labor federation through its political action committee expects to contribute at least 800000 to candidates for the House and Senate including a smattering of Republicans friendly to labor While this will have to be divided among at least 150 aspirants many in the closer races will get a larger share Another problem confronting labor as the summer winds down is the Presidents surprising ability to keep himself from being identified closely with the countrys economic problems Labor leaders were amazed at the support Mr Reagan continues to hold Mr Perkins said and cant help admiring his ability to focus attention away from the economy and on issues such as tuition tax credits abortion and the Soviet pipeline to Europe Its still easier to criticize Reagan programs than it is to attack him he added If he can continue to convince people the recession isnt his doing and they should be patient a few months longer it will help Republican candidates this fall Labor hopes to change this concept before October It also hopes Mr Perkins said to dilute the widespread cynicism COPE has found among so many potential voters who at this time do not expect either party to do much of anything for them
DEFUND THE LEFT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/opinion/defund-the-left.html,Is it fair to require taxpayers to finance the political activities of groups whose views they do not share Most people would say no Yet it has been estimated that since the 1970s hundreds of millions of dollars  maybe more than 1 billion  in taxpayers money has been used each year to support and spread political views that the American people have consistently and overwhelmingly rejected For example many Americans do not support taxfinanced abortion on demand compulsory unionism forced busing of schoolchildren Federal control of education racial quotas in hiring radical feminism and major cutbacks in defense spending Yet millions of dollars are given to these causes not through tax exemptions or deductions but through direct grants by the Government In 1980 more than 70 million in taxpayers money was given by the Department of Health and Human Service to Planned Parenthood which lobbies for Federal funding of abortions That year 110 million was handed over by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and several other agencies to the National Urban League a politically powerful lobby Tax money has also been given by Vista to the Youth Project which finances antiMXmissile activism in Nevada and antinuclear demonstrations in New York City But even most Americans supported these views those in the minority should not be forced to finance political groups or causes with which they disagree Thomas Jefferson stated the issue best in the 1777 Virginia Declaration of Religious Liberty To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical That is why conservatives believe that defunding the left should be a principal priority of the Reagan Administration Among politically activist groups that received Federal funds over the last five years are the American Civil Liberties Union the Gray Panthers the National Council of La Raza the AFLCIO the United Automobile Workers the National Education Association Planned Parenthood Americans for Democratic Action the National Welfare Rights Organization Tom Haydens Laurel Springs Institute David Rockefellers Council on Foreign Relations Cesar Chavezs United Farmworkers Association and the National Council of Churches Unfortunately this flow of money has only been somewhat reduced rather than stopped by the Reagan Administration Last year for example the Department of Education despite an internal report stating that the Rev Jesse Jacksons PushExcel education project does not add up to a program gave Push 656644 The same department also gave 64923 to the prounilateraldisarmament American Friends Service Committee and more than 275000 to the National Organization for Womens Legal Defense and Education Fund The granting of more than a total of 1 million to the National Council of Churches from 1978 to 1981 got almost no publicity in the news media But it is not hard to imagine the thousands of editorials and columns that would be written and rightly so about the separation of church and state if the Rev Jerry Falwells Moral Majority received 1 million in Federal funds The result is anything but fair If the situation were reversed liberals would probably see an important First Amendment issue at stake The real issue is not whether taxfunded projects are good or bad liberal or conservative It is that they represent involuntary taxpayer support of special political interests support that is fairly well concealed from the public The typical liberal approach to the Reagan budget cuts and cutbacks in social programs is to ask Are they fair I ask liberals Is it fair for the Government to use billions of dollars of taxpayers money to fund and further the political and social causes they support while conservatives have to go into the marketplace of competing ideas and interests to support the causes we believe in Whats past is past I challenge liberals to join conservatives starting now in renouncing the Department of Health and Human Services grants and those of other agencies to liberal advocacy groups I challenge the liberals to enter the marketplace to stop taking tax money for their causes to finance their activities with private not public money If liberal causes are truly as important as the liberals think they are there should be no shortage of supporters for them Liberals should be willing to join conservatives in raising funds voluntarily rather than continuing to take other peoples tax money Defunding the left has become one of the top priorities of many conservatives But it is a cause that should appeal to all fairminded Americans
BUSING ISSUE: NEW ATTACKS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/12/us/busing-issue-new-attacks-news-analysis.html,The Reagan Administrations longpromised campaign to enlist the Federal courts as vehicles for remolding Federal law has finally shifted into high gear The campaign was heralded nine months ago in a speech by Attorney General William French Smith who urged the Federal courts to take notice of the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election The Justice Department did little immediately to follow through on that theme But in the last few weeks it has produced legal briefs asking courts to reconsider their approaches in two areas central to the Administrations social policy agenda abortion and busing In the busing brief filed last week in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the department is seeking for the first time to open for reconsideration a busing order imposed by a Federal court as a remedy for unconstitutional segregation The busing plan in Louisianas East Baton Rouge Parish in effect for one school year was sought and obtained by the Justice Department But in 1980 the Government intervened as a plaintiff in an existing suit against the East Baton Rouge Parish school board The case one of the longestrunning desegregation suits in the country was first brought in 1956 when the parish maintained dual segregated school systems Department Urges Busing Delay In 1981 25 years and two trips to the Supreme Court later a Federal district judge ruled that the districts 113 schools were still segregated in violation of the Constitution and ordered the school board to begin busing The school board appealed to the Fifth Circuit In the papers it filed last week the Justice Department asked the appellate court to uphold the finding that the East Baton Rouge schools were unconstitutionally segregated It also asked the court not to uphold the busing order but rather to defer its consideration to enable the trial court to decide whether to withdraw the busing order on its own and substitute a more effective and less intrusive desegregation program Conceding that it had urged adoption of the busing plan just two years ago the department said Experience has shown courtordered transportation generally to be a failed experiment that erodes community support for public education It suggested that such voluntary incentives to desegregate as magnet schools which seek to attract both black and white students by offering special programs should take the place of mandatory transportation Two Objections to Busing Two separate objections to busing were raised by the department One was that it was unfair to impose the heavy burden of busing on children who are themselves innocent of any wrongdoing that officials may have committed decades earlier The second was that busing did not work it provoked white flight and led to resegregation of the very schools that were to be integrated Both arguments are familiar the newness lies in the fact that the party making them is the Justice Department and not a local school board For years the departments view has been that community opposition was not a relevant consideration for a court attempting to remedy unconstitutional segregation By and large the Federal courts have agreed with that view The Supreme Court while insisting that busing orders be tailored to the scope of the constitutional violation has continued to uphold even manifestly unpopular busing plans once it is satisfied that unconstitutional segregation existed It is therefore far from certain that the departments arguments will find favor with the Fifth Circuit the Federal appellate court that presided over much of the civil rights revolution in the South at a time when few of its landmark constitutional rulings were winning popular favor Much to Gain Politically At the same time it is far from clear that a rebuff by the Fifth Circuit would deeply distress the Reagan Administration Its sights are on far bigger targets than East Baton Rouge Parish The Administration which three months ago endorsed legislation to strip the lower Federal courts of authority to order the busing of children more than five miles or 15 minutes from their homes has much to gain and little to lose politically if the busing issue were to find its way once again to the Supreme Court While a change of direction by the High Court would gratify the Administration and its supporters a refusal by the Court to reverse itself would be useful as well providing further ammunition for the Attorney Generals attacks on subjective judicial policymaking The Baton Rouge brief as well as last months brief telling the Supreme Court to give heavy deference to efforts by state and local politicians to restrict access to abortion comes at a time when the Administration is under a steady attack from conservatives As an editorial in Conservative Digest described it last month the Administration has not fulfilled promises to get this country out of the terrible mess created by almost 50 years of virtually unchecked liberalism Increasingly the conservatives focus has been on what they see as the Administrations failure to use the courts to implement its social policy agenda The Administration may not succeed but after the last few weeks no one can accuse it of

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/12/us/briefing-077923.html,Switch on Youth Year T he United Nations has declared 1985 the International Year of Youth and the Reagan Administration seems determined that this countrys observance strike the appropriate political notes William Treanor a consultant to a Senate subcommittee on juvenile justice who has an extensive background in social work with young people took the lead in the spring of 1981 in organizing a committee of youth organizations to coordinate International Youth Year activities in the United States The Treanor group held a series of informal meetings with John McDonald head of the State Departments Bureau of International Organizations Affairs and assumed that it would win official recognition from the Reagan Administration That was before the International Communication Agency decided that Soviet propagandists were certain to exploit the observance The agency contracted with Roy Godson an intelligence analyst at the National Strategy Information Center to assess the world youth situation and recommend ways the United States could counter Soviet propaganda Then according to several Administration officials ICA officials successfully exerted pressure on the State Department to relieve Mr McDonald of youthyear duty Following that Mr Treanors group learned that the Administration had designated the United States Youth Council partially financed by the ICA as the official coordinator of the American observance At a preliminary meeting of the councils International Youth Year commission held in Mr Godsons office the ICAs Ronald L Trowbridge according to two sources who attended the session urged the group to get into this thing with the flags waving and at one point referred to the YMCA as a leftwing organization I began to wonder what I was said one participant when someone suggested as one IYY activity having Kate Smith sing God Bless America to a big room full of young refugees FamilyPlanning Waste T he American Life Lobby a major group opposed to abortion has joined the conservative rebellion against the taxincrease bill that has sparks flying between President Reagan and Representative Jack Kemp Republican of upstate New York The group is actively lobbying against the bill because Gary Curran legislative director of the organization insists that a tax increase would provide more money for the Government to waste on family planning programs As an example Mr Curran cited a disco dance sponsored last March by Planned Parenthood of Washington This group he said used Federal dollars to decorate the dance hall with contraceptive devices a promotion that Richard S Schweiker Secretary of Health and Human Services denounced at the time as an example of irresponsibility and bad judgment in these times of budget restraint All the Wrong Moves A t the Democratic National Committee staff members are still chortling about their recent softball game with their counterparts at the Republican National Committee Much to the discomfort of the Republicans the game was played on a field selected by the Democrats next to an innercity housing project and as one Democrat put it the Republicans made all the wrong moves even though they won the game 13 to 7 For a starter some of the Republican team members arrived at the softball field in a rented limousine which immediately attracted a crowd of young blacks who assumed that somebody important was on their turf They should have known a limousine would attract a crowd said one Democratic slugger And if that wasnt conspicuous enough the chauffeur held an umbrella over a Republican spectator Then they got out their beer while the kids were gathering around to see what was happening At the end of the game the players discovered that four of their cars three of them belonging to Republicans had smashed windows The Democrats who play at the field regularly were amused but the Republicans called in the police to make a report and since it was convenient to escort them out of the area Big Three Pollsters C lose observers of the Reagan White House have noticed that each of the Big Three James A Baker 3d Edwin Meese 3d and Michael K Deaver appears to have a favorite Republican pollster for White House polling projects For their own reasons which they have kept to themselves Mr Baker Mr Meese and Mr Deaver favor Robert Teeter Richard Wirthlin and Arthur Finklestein respectively Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr
BREAKFAST STIR: GLENN ON SOCIAL SECURITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/13/us/breakfast-stir-glenn-on-social-security.html,There are all kinds of devices that politicians use to edge up to a formal announcement that they are running for the Presidency a luncheon with the National Press Club a platform appearance at their partys midterm convention the formation of a political action committee So it was that Senator John Glenn flanked by four aides and looking as wholesome as a box of Wheaties appeared this morning at one of those working Washington breakfasts to try out on a group of political reporters the rough outlines and a few specifics of his campaign platform should he decide to run But by the time the Ohio Democrats eggs and bacon had gotten cold he had somehow managed to embroil himself in one of the nations hottest political controversies At the breakfasts end almost as an afterthought Mr Glenn said that the nation ought to consider instituting a voluntary alternative to the Social Security system for younger people Such a quasiprivate alternative for people in their younger years he added could help wean ourselves away from the current system There was a sudden flurry of notetaking and making his own note of that Senator Glenn began to step back from his idea reiterating his previously stated view that cutting Social Security payments to those currently receiving benefits would be a violation of the contract a sacred trust between Government and those people One of Several Ideas Asked how payments to older Americans could be made if younger people paid into a private insurance scheme Mr Glenn replied that additional funds for the system might be obtained from general revenues or from a tax for that purpose And he added quickly a private component would have to be phased in over 20 to 30 years Im not proposing this Mr Glenn said in an effort to conclude the matter and get back to the original business at hand Its just one of several ideas that we should consider Up until that point the breakfast one of many morning briefings put together by Godfrey Sperling Jr of The Christian Science Monitor had been without major political incident The Senator had carefully navigated his way through a minefield of questions Was he too boring to be President someone asked bringing up a touchy reservation periodically mentioned by some political pros We have a great communicator in the White House right now and I dont like some of his policies he replied Then warming to his task the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth described what he termed his almost ideal background for the job 23 years in the Marine Corps President of Royal Crown International I was in the space program No Need to Hoot But I dont claim to be a nuclear engineer he added in a notsoveiled reference to Jimmy Carter though I dont mean to cast any aspersions But did he feel passionately enough about issues I felt very passionately about my country when I was on top of that booster and in two world wars he shot back It wasnt rhetoric or gobbledygook on the line it was me But I dont see any need to hoot and holler about it What about the social issues On abortion he answered he was prochoice He said he was against tuition tax credits for private school students and against mandatory prayers in school His basic themes he continued were education research and development and freeenterprise capital to renew the countrys basic industry and sustain growth President Reagans tax proposal would not work he asserted because it was aimed at middle and upperincome people He said he favored a smaller tax cut aimed at businesses There was passion in his voice when he spoke about defense and nuclear nonproliferation He said he would not cut military spending except for the MX missile and the rapid deployment force But much could and should be done to stop the spread of nuclear weapons he said Before departing the Senator let drop that he would soon be announcing the formation of a political action committee and disclosed that he was beginning to put together a field organization After all he noted the first caucuses were still 14 to 16 months away Its not too late he said
...AND THE LIMITS OF A MAJORITY'S POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/13/opinion/l-and-the-limits-of-a-majority-s-power-081968.html,To the Editor I would like to add one thought to Linda Greenhouses excellent analysis Aug 10 of the brief filed by Solicitor General Rex E Lee in the state abortion cases now pending in the United States Supreme Court v hat seems to have escaped his notice is that our Constitution and especially its Bill of Rights is premised on the conclusion that not even a legislative majority can abrogate individual freedoms The courts are here to prevent their doing so That is the essence of the separation of powers which is the basis of our constitutional system It is in fact the genius of the Constitution that it does protect the right not only of minorities but also of individuals against decisions taken by legislative majorities which Mr Lee thinks should be the last word If it were such legislative majorities could cut off all individual liberties of minorities and individuals such as their freedom of speech press religion and many others which the Constitution guarantees The Supreme Court has held in my opinion correctly that these basic individual rights guaranteed against government takeover by legislative action include a womans freedom to choose abortion with the concurrence of her physician If because there is a majority opinion in a particular legislature about a particular freedom at any time that freedom should be abrogated there is nothing standing between us and the absolute rule of legislative majorities which is anathema to our system Incidentally all polls show that the real majority in this country does favor a womans right to choose abortion in all or a wide variety of circumstances The whole point of the constitutional system is that the courts are here to protect individuals and minorities when a legislative majority seeks to deprive them of the invaluable rights guaranteed by the Constitution It is precisely this cardinal principle of personal freedom that the Solicitor Generals brief seeks to do away with Finally it should be borne in mind that the Solicitor General who should presumably be busy with Federal cases has chosen gratuitously to express what is essentially his antiAmerican sentiments in this regard in three cases involving not Federal but state legislation  in and of itself a rather radical step for a conservative Administration to take Or is this Administration conservative in the true sense of the word meaning to preserve and protect only when it comes to economics Apparently it does not by its philosophy as expressed by Mr Lee wish to conserve the basic liberties of the American people against the attacks of any group just so long as that group is a majority in a particular legislature at a particular time and place HARRIET F PILPEL New York Aug 10 1982
"SOLICITER GENERAL LEE, THE ABORTION ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/13/opinion/l-soliciter-general-lee-the-abortion-issue-081967.html,To the Editor On Aug 4 you published an editorial sharply attacking Solicitor General Rex E Lee who a week earlier had filed with the Supreme Court an amicus brief in two abortion cases he brief supports the position that lower courts erred when they invalidated regulations adopted by Missouri and Akron Ohio which require second trimester abortions to be performed in hospitals require the disclosure of all relevant facts to the pregnant woman including facts of fetal development and medical risks of abortion mandate a 24hour waiting period before performing any abortion etc You did not just criticize the positions taken in the brief You also accused Lee of venting his deep personal quarrel with most of the Courts abortion decisions while distorting the function of his respected office and of trashing the Justice departments reputation as a source of principled counsel to the Court by filing a brief for the United States in cases in which there is no Federal interest These are serious charges One of the proud traditions of the Solicitor Generals office is its reputation for integrity independence and professional excellence and during his nearly 20 years as a lawyer Rex Lee has earned precisely such a reputation for himself The reputation of the man and the office have been impugned But your accusations are totally unfounded Usually the Solicitor General files briefs in Supreme Court cases in which the United States is a party or will be directly affected by the decision One issue the Court expressly agreed to hear in the pending abortion cases concerns the proper standard of judicial review of abortion regulations The standard established by the Court will apply to Federal as well as state abortion regulations As mentioned on the first page of Lees brief the Government has a direct interest in the Courts decision on this issue because Congress has in the past enacted legislation impacting upon the abortion decision  and may again do so in the future In fact Congress is at present considering several proposed abortion regulations which could be enacted before the end of the year Thus as Lee indicated the Government does have a substantial interest in preserving the proper sphere of legislative action Equally important is the wellestablished prerogative of the Solicitor General to file an amicus curiae brief in cases of exceptional national importance Prior Solicitors General have filed such briefs in landmark cases in which the US was neither a party nor directly involved such as the school desegregation cases Brown v Board of Education etc the voting rights case Baker v Carr and the reverse discrimination case Bakke v Board of Regents of University of California You did not accuse any Solicitor General of distorting the function of his respected office in those cases Since you are unlikely to deny that abortion is an issue of great national importance your uncharacteristically intemperate indeed ad hominem argument must be traceable to the position taken by the Government rather than the decision to file an amicus brief The argument and position presented in Lees brief actually are very moderate The theme of the brief is the need for judicial restraint and deference to policy decisions of the elected representatives of the people when legislative and judicial authority overlap He does not ask the Court to abandon its constitutional responsibility of judicial review he merely suggests that it should give more deference to legislative choices concerning abortion regulations Your accusations apparently stem from your intense disagreement with the Solicitor General regarding the policy position he has taken Of course you should feel free to criticize Lees policies and positions But it is irresponsible for any newspaper  especially one as influential as The Times  to make unfounded accusations of impropriety in filing a brief just because the position taken in it is one with which the newspaper disagrees You owe Solicitor General Lee an apology DeanCARL S HAWKINS Prof ROBERT E RIGGS Assoc Prof LYNN D WARDLE Assoc ProfW COLE DURHAM JR Brigham Young University Law School Prof CHRISTOPHER L BLAKESLEY McGeorge School of Law University of the Pacific Provo Utah Aug 6 1982
TAX SCANDAL ROILS MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/14/us/tax-scandal-roils-massachusetts-governor-race.html,When Lieut Gov Thomas P ONeill 3d was getting a haircut the other day his barber brought up a subject that has dominated the headlines here all summer the bitterly contested battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination between Gov Edward J King and the man he defeated in 1978 former Gov Michael S Dukakis The entire Italian community is going to vote for King  King is going to win big Mr ONeill the son of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives recalled the barber telling him about the Sept 14 primary The barbers comment surprised Mr ONeill who was himself a candidate for the governorship until last May because for the last few weeks most political analysts here have felt that Governor King has been badly stung by a spreading corruption scandal in the Massachusetts Revenue Department Earlier Troubles Recalled Involved in the scandal were a deputy revenue commissioner who hanged himself and turned out to be one of the Governors old high school friends a convicted tax swindler whom Mr King apparently helped get a job and the State Revenue Commissioner who sought to stall an investigation by the State Attorney General into reported payoffs to department officials by delinquent taxpayers The scandal has revived memories of Governor Kings earlier troubles with incompetent and corrupt subordinates just as he appeared to be gaining ground on Mr Dukakis through a 1 million television advertising blitz and wellpublicized efforts to cut taxes and crack down on drunken drivers In May Mr Dukakis handily won the partys nonbinding endorsement at the State Democratic Convention and as late as June a poll by The Boston Globe found him besting Mr King by 68 percent to 20 percent But Mr ONeill said his own street polling told him that the imbroglio in the Revenue Department had not hurt the Governors recent comeback People have a steadfast belief that corruption exists in Massachusetts and take it for granted said Mr ONeill sitting in his Statehouse office overlooking the Boston Common Perhaps more important Mr ONeill added is that politics in Massachusetts still tends to be tribal warfare It may not be exactly ethnic he said but class is very significant In this struggle Mr Dukakis appeals to liberals suburban residents and the states relatively large number of intellectuals Governor King a 57yearold conservative and former professional football player who opposes abortion and favors the death penalty tends to draw support from bluecollar workers in the old industrial cities and the Roman Catholic Irish and Italian communities The Governor is also favored by the leaders of the states new hightechnology industries who like his calls for ridding Massachusetts of its hightax image His effort to repeal a 7 percent surtax on the state income tax imposed in the Dukakis administration was defeated in the Legislature last week But the overall state tax burden has been reduced by about 25 percent since Mr King took office largely because of a sharp rise in personal income Beyond these divisions within the state the primary election has national significance as a test of just how permanent is the swing to the political right as evidenced by the 1980 elections Mr Kings victory over Mr Dukakis in the 1978 Democratic primary presaged Ronald Reagans triumph over Jimmy Carter two years later and Mr King is widely viewed here as President Reagans favorite Democratic Governor Mr ONeill and a number of other politicians believe the current battle between Mr Dukakis and Governor King is too close to call despite Mr Dukakiss lead in the polls He enjoyed a big lead in 1978 too before being defeated by Mr King Gerald FitzGerald Mr Dukakiss press secretary said polls taken for the Dukakis campaign showed him still ahead by 20 percent But I expect it to close up tighter Mr FitzGerald added Its going to be a very close horse race The scandal in the Revenue Department began with the arrest of a lowlevel official Stanley J Barczak on bribery charges in June Mr Barczak it turned out worked for Mr King in his 1978 campaign and had an appointment to see him last fall although the Governor has said he could not remember if he met Mr Barczak Mr Barczak served a fiveyear prison term in the 1950s after being convicted of tax fraud while working for the Internal Revenue Service Tax Official Found Hanged More damaging for the Governor was the disclosure this week by the Boston press that he had been informed on July 21 that John F Coady an old friend who was appointed by Mr King as deputy revenue commissioner was implicated in a grand jury investigation of the department Several days later Mr Coady hanged himself in his home As a further embarrassment Joyce Hampers the Revenue Commissioner initially refused to turn over files subpoened by the grand jury and later insinuated that the Attorney Generals office had been responsible for a breakin at her office Moreover Mrs Hampers and her husband a physician and industrialist were ordered by a Federal Tax Court judge last year to pay 16818 plus interest in back taxes when he disallowed an elaborate tax shelter they had established according to Charles Maurer an attorney with the Boston office of the Internal Revenue Service Neither Mrs Hampers nor her spokesman returned phone calls to their offices for comment on the case
SUBTLE ROLE OF AN ETHNIC CONSTITUENCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/14/us/subtle-role-of-an-ethnic-constituency.html,Representative Nick J Rahalls grandparents were born in Lebanon and the troubles in his ancestral homeland have always touched his life A new town hall that his family financed for their home village near the Israeli border was taken over by the Palestine Liberation Organization as their local headquarters Recently Mr Rahall a West Virginia Democrat has emerged as a leading critic of Israel on Capitol Hill and last month he was part of a Congressional delegation that toured the battle zone in Beirut and talked with leaders throughout the Middle East When he got home he issued a statement that said As I looked out from the bowels of Beirut from what was once the beacon of beauty in the Mideast the shining Mediterranean Sea I could only weep for the land of my grandparents Mr Rahall is one of six members of Congress who trace their origins to Lebanon and most of them have been drawn into the whirlpool of Middle Eastern politics in recent weeks Their experience demonstrates the subtle but important role that ethnicity plays on Capitol Hill where most lawmakers with visible ethnic origins represent a constituency in addition to the people who voted for them In an important sense a PolishAmerican from Chicago also represents Poles in Cleveland or Queens And Hispanic voters in Colorado look to Hispanic members of Congress from Texas for leadership This second constituency contributes money to a lawmakers campaign influences his vote and helps set his political agenda Flood of Requests for Aid Take Representative Mary Rose Oakar an Ohio Democrat of Lebanese and Syrian extraction who also traveled to the war front Before she left she was besieged by requests from around the country asking for help in locating relatives Senator James Abdnor Republican of South Dakota attended a hearing with Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and mentioned that he had an elderly aunt in Lebanon As the Senators spokesman related the story the woman was tracked down by Israeli intelligence agents within days and offered safe passage out of the country She accepted and now lives in Iowa Above all these lawmakers bring to the current debate a special concern for Lebanon and its people Senator George J Mitchell a Maine Democrat whose mother was born in Lebanon recalls reading an editorial that discussed the interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis There was not a single word about the interests of the Lebanese he said That omission says something about the views Americans have of the Middle East To be sure politicians have always traded on ethnic ties starting up the political ladder by gathering support from their own communities But ethnic identity has been intruding more directly into Congressional affairs in recent years Not the Lebanese Senator Our parents tried so hard to be Americans that they often submerged their ethnicity said Representative Toby Moffett a Connecticut Democrat whose father was born on the boat trip between Lebanon and America I feel myself part of a much larger move back to ethnic roots Ethnicity can be a touchy issue and legislators are usually quick to point out that their first loyalty is to the United States and their home district Senator Abdnor for instance declined to discuss the issue He does not want to be portrayed as the Lebanese Senator said his press secretary Moreover lawmakers can get caught up in some vicious factional feuding There is for instance a sharp conflict among the LebaneseAmericans over how sympathetic they should be to the Arab cause Still the move back to ethnic roots shows up on Capitol Hill in all sorts of ways and the most obvious is when legislators try to influence public policy toward their homelands Jews for instance have long provided the backbone of Congressional support for Israel PolishAmericans have been outspoken critics of the martial law imposed by Warsaw and Moscow Lawmakers of Greek origin have played a major role in tilting American policy toward Greece and away from Turkey as those ancient enemies squabble over Cyprus The Irish Question After the 1980 Italian earthquake Representative Geraldine A Ferraro a Queens Democrat visited the devastated area and helped get Congress to provide emergency aid She found the experience so captivating that she started studying Italian Many lawmakers of Irish extraction including House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr a Massachusetts Democrat have been deeply concerned about the ongoing strife in Northern Ireland and have tried to discourage IrishAmerican support for the Irish Republican Army Representative Norman Y Mineta a California Democrat who grew up in an internment camp for JapaneseAmericans has a staff member assigned to keep up with Japanese communities across the nation He is also holding a fundraiser for voters from other Asian and Pacific nations who have no countrymen of their own on Capitol Hill But ethnic ties are not always a political plus In Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank a Jewish Democrat has had runins with the Humberto Cardinal Madeiros over the issue of abortion A number of Mr Franks constituents are of Portugese ancestry as is the cardinal So the lawmaker called for campaign help from Representative Tony Coelho Democrat of California the only PortugeseAmerican in Congress ArabAmericans Were Afraid LebaneseAmericans in Congress have been slow to speak out on ethnic issues until recently mirroring according to Mr Rahall the political timidity of their ethnic community ArabAmericans he said were very afraid to get involved in politics Many of them had set up successful businesses and often their biggest customers were Jewish Besides he added the word Arab conveyed a very bad impression in this country and as a result most ArabAmericans wanted to hide their identity But that started changing as the oil weapon gave Arab nations new influence and Arab Americans picked up some pointers from their Jewish counterparts The Jewish organizations here and around the country have always been very active and wellorganized as they should be Mr Rahall said The Arab organizations have been vocal of late because they have been learning from the Jewish lobby

A WORLD INHOSPITABLE TO CHILDREN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/16/opinion/l-a-world-inhospitable-to-children-087437.html,To the Editor The tragedy of this country is not abortion on demand as President Reagan put it when speaking to a large gathering of Catholics news story Aug 4 but a situation where one pregnant woman in four thinks it better not to bring her child into the world Instead of attacking the symptom of abortion it would be better if all those who deprecate women who choose abortion worked to make this a world where children had a chance to grow up in a safe environment where their mothers earned more than 59 cents on the dollar where they would not be discriminated against because of race sex or poverty where a nuclear holocaust would not seem more probable every day The true cause of abortion is a world that has no hope If the antichoice religious and political groups would only work for a better world instead of making this one ever more difficult for women and the poor to function in and if President Reagan would try to make this country a better place for women to raise their children then maybe the need for abortion would be reduced Meanwhile for a quarter of all pregnant women not having their babies seems to them to be their only option The real tragedy is what this society has become not the choice of women to have an abortion ADRIAN RUTH WALTER Boston Aug 5 1982
RELIGIOUS RIGHT GROWING IMPATIENT WITH REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/16/us/religious-right-growing-impatient-with-reagan.html,Leaders of the religious right frustrated by their inability to translate many of the issues on their agenda into law say they are growing increasingly impatient with President Reagan They say they fear that many religiously conservative voters who had great hopes for their agenda when Mr Reagan won in 1980 will stay away from the polls in November disillusioned by politics High on their agenda are a proposed amendment to the Constitution on school prayer legislation against abortion and tuition tax credits On the other hand moderate and liberal religious leaders active in Washington say they may have overestimated the political power of the lobbying groups formed by conservative religious organizations in 1979 Cal Thomas director of communications for the conservative lobby Moral Majority said recently Theres no question that President Reagan has not put personal pressure on the prayer amendment and antiabortion issue The Rev Jerry Falwell head of Moral Majority said he still had personal confidence in the Presidents commitment to those issues But Im a little anxious that we havent had some aggressive support he said Compromise and Expediency To religious conservatives the lack of movement on legislation prompted by moral concerns signals immoral compromise and crass political expediency We were able to motivate previously uninterested voters because we believed President Reagan was a man of principle Mr Thomas said There are no monuments in Washington to budget balancers there are monuments to those who took a stand on principles I dont think he has come through at all for us He has not followed through on his personal beliefs There are some folks at the White House who are soft on our social issues said Gary Jarmin the legislative director of Christian Voice another conservative lobby He did not specify whom he had in mind Mr Jarmin said that foolish legislative strategy on the part of the Reagan Administration would make it very difficult to get positive action on the prayer amendment and related issues this year They planned it this way he said In practical terms the President is said to have been been so occupied with the economy and the national budget that the Administration has had little time to consider other issues Division Over Direction Mr Reagan frequently voices his desire for organized prayer in public schools and antiabortion legislation and did so most recently in Hartford at the centennial convention of the Knights of Columbus a Roman Catholic lay organization But he wants us conservatives to be united on the subjects before he gets behind a specific proposal said Mr Thomas Mr Reagan received a warm response in Hartford when he backed a constitutional amendment permitting officially sanctioned school prayer So far religious conservatives have been split over the proper legislative path to pursue which has lessened their impact in Washington Those holding strict religious views are not willing to make the compromises and tradeoffs required in practical politics according to Stan Hastey of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs in Washington The Senate Judiciary Committee held a poorly attended hearing recently on the proposed amendment which would reverse Supreme Court decisions prohibiting officially sanctioned public prayer or religious ovservances in schools No member of the Administration testified and it was clear that conservatives were not united behind behind the measure The Southern Baptist Convention the largest conservative Protestant denomination endorsed the plan this year but the Rev Jimmy R Allen a former president of the denomination testified against the measure at the hearings Evangelicals Ask a Broadening The National Association of Evangelicals spoke for the amendment but wanted to broaden it to allow other religious activities in public schools a proposal almost certain to be found unacceptable by others who support the present measure No one from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops testified at the Senate hearing but a representative of the Knights of Columbus was called to present testimony in favor of the proposed amendment The bishops are reportedly reviewing a 1973 statement of their conferences administrative board endorsing prayer in public schools to see whether that statement is appropriate for the 1982 debate on a constitutional amendment Mr Jarmin said that while the prayer amendment might be voted out of the Senate committee it would be difficult to get it to the floor of the House The religious right has also failed to find a common approach toward antiabortion legislation Moral Majority has not endorsed any of the proposals now under consideration The more politically experienced National Conference of Catholic Bishops has supported a plan offered by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah that would let states decide whether to allow abortions Wary of Government Intrusion While many conservative Protestants joined with Catholics to support tuition tax credits for parents with children in private schools staunch fundamentalists are increasingly wary of any proposal that could lead to government intrusion in religious education And the lobby made up of representatives of public education such as teachers unions has always been able to scuttle proposals that would obliquely aid private education Another proposal languishing in the legislative process is the wideranging Family Protection Act introduced by Senator Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada A recent Moral Majority conference on the family was laced with complaints about lack of government response to conservative concerns about legislation affecting the family Mr Jarmin of the Christian Voice is critical of the President but lays more of the responsibility on the White House staff and the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee Weve been waiting 18 months for his promises of votes on some of these issues Mr Jarmin said of Mr Baker Other Side Is Encouraged Church leaders who have opposed the conservative platform of the religious right are encouraged by recent events The influence of the socalled religious right has been exaggerated said Mr Hastey of the Baptist committee The Rev Charles Bergstrom who heads the Washington office of the Lutheran Council in the USA said he was pessimistic when I went to the hearing on the prayer amendment and very much heartened when I left Mr Bergstrom who is also active in People for the American Way which was formed to oppose the religious right said he believed that even such conservative Senators as Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama now understood that a constitutional amendment on school prayer might not be advisable There will be a Senate debate on antiabortion proposals and probably on school prayer next week Mr Jarmin predicted that the discussion might help us build momentum for the next session of Congress adding We have not had enough to call this session a great victory The strategy of putting our concerns off for a year was what hurt us most These social issues are our bread and butter in the elections Mr Jarmin added He has said he fears that the voters the religious lobby rallied for the 1980 elections might not turn out this year But he said this might show them that we have only won a battle not the war
TAX MEASURE GETS PANEL'S APPROVAL; STIFF FIGHT AHEAD,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/16/us/tax-measure-gets-panel-s-approval-stiff-fight-ahead.html,Weary Senate and House negotiators approved a 983 billion tax bill early this morning The measure now faces votes in both houses of Congress with the outcome still in doubt In addition to raising taxes for smokers travelers corporations and families with big medical expenses the bill which has President Reagans full support would reduce spending by about 17 billion over the next three years in areas such as Medicare Medicaid and welfare Most of the changes would take effect next July 1 Approval of the package came at 2 AM after conferees seeking to attract votes of legislators from states with high unemployment voted to extend Federal unemployment compensation benefits for 10 weeks beyond the current 39week cutoff Action on Other Aspects In the final session the conferees also voted to double the cigarette tax to 16 cents a pack from 8 cents to repeal after 1983 a provision of the 1981 taxcut bill that encouraged unprofitable companies to sell some of their tax benefits to moneymaking companies and dropped a Senate provision that would have reduced the capital gains holding period to six months from one year Measures intended to stop cheating on taxes mostly by neglecting to declare income should provide about onefifth of the new revenue A 10 percent withholding tax on most interest and dividend payments would go into effect next July 1 President Reagan continued to seek Republican support for the bill today flying 32 members of Congress by helicopter for lunch at Camp David the Presidential retreat in Maryland in an effort to persuade them that the tax package is essential for a strong economy Most of the provisions in the tax bill such as the increase in the cigarette tax would become effective July 1 1983 Some of the items such as an increase in maximum permitted contributions to a selfemployed individuals Keogh plan would be gradually phased in over a period of more than one year While the tax package is not likely to reach the House floor until midweek both the Senate and House will have other controversial issues to deal with before then It will be a week of focusing on other economic issues appropriating money for essential Government services reaching agreement on legislation forcing Congressional committees to stay within overall spending ceilings and raising the debt limit Some Senators said it would also be a week in which they planned to force action on issues such as banning abortions and permitting voluntary prayers in public schools The Senate also is scheduled to vote on a bill granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens As explosive as some of these issues are the biggest fight of the week is expected to be over the tax package Passage is going to be tough said Representative Dan Rostenkowski Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee as the conferees wound up their work James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff said the bill faced an an uphill fight But he predicted on the CBS News television program Face the Nation that the bill would be approved this week before Congress begins a scheduled vacation Senator Bob Dole Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee was more optimistic Appearing on Meet the Press an NBC News program Senator Dole predicted that Congress would approve the tax package He noted that inclusion of the extension of unemployment compensation benefits could attract votes of some legislators from states with high unemployment Commenting that the tax package represented a bipartisan effort Senator Dole said it would require 90 to 100 Republican votes in the House There is no doubt about it he said We did a good job met our targets and came up with sound solid spending reductions Among those who went to Camp David with members of Congress to discuss the tax bill with the President were David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget and Edwin Meese 3d counselor to the President The President also plans to sound his appeal for the tax bill in a nationwide televised address Monday night Democratic opponents in Congress have asked the networks for equal time to respond to the President ABC said tonight it would grant the Democrats time to reply Mr Reagan had sharp words for conservatives who have opposed the tax bill saying he was surprised at the division that it has caused within Republican ranks But he seemed unready to restore harmony Theyre so far on the wrong side now that I think maybe its up to them to restore it with me the President said in an interview to be published Monday in The Washington Times Mr Reagan was quoted as saying Very frankly I am surprised because I think the issue is so clearcut As for the conservative critics the President added I have to be frank and say they cannot be described as people who were followers and abandoned me Some of them never were for me President Reagan and other supporters of the tax measure have taken pains to declare that it largely closes loopholes and improves collection of taxes Tax experts agree that the bill contains many provisions aimed at tax reform that have generally been sought by liberal Democrats rather than conservative Republicans However the expected economic effect of the bill is a matter of considerable debate coming as it does only a year after Congress passed the largest tax cut in history Opponents argue that higher taxes will impede economic recovery While the tax bill is likely to generate the most heated debates of the week ahead other issues also are likely to spark interest as both the Senate and House move toward what they hope will be a nearly threeweek holiday In addition to tax and money issues the Senate could get bogged down this week in emotional debate over abortion and school prayers Attempts to add these proposals to a pending bill raising the debt limit are scheduled for early in the week by several Senators The Senate also is expected to vote Tuesday on a bill granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens
D'AMATO IS GIVEN TESTIMONY OPPOSING PRETRIAL DETENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/nyregion/d-amato-is-given-testimony-opposing-pretrial-detention.html,Senator Alfonse M DAmato yesterday repeated his support of a proposal that would allow judges to hold without bail defendants they considered dangers to society but New York Citys Police and Fire Commissioners refused to go along with him The Senator and the Commissioners exchanged views at a Senate subcommittee hearing at 1 Federal Plaza on how crime affects small businesses in New York Mr DAmato who is chairman of the subcommittee said pretrial detention would keep dangerous criminals off the streets until they could be tried Smallbusiness owners and community leaders who testified at the hearings also supported the proposal Higher Bail Advocated But the Commissioners  Robert J McGuire of the Police Department and Charles J Hynes of the Fire Department  said that setting high bail would achieve the same goal without infringing upon defendants constitutional rights This is like an abortion debate people have their own opinions Mr McGuire said I dont think you have to get into preventive detention to accomplish the same goal During the threehour hearing of the Senate Small Business Subcommittee on Urban and Rural Economic Development both Mr McGuire and Mr Hynes acknowledged that many people on bail commit crimes but they blamed the criminaljustice system for being permissive and inefficient Mr Hynes who said he was speaking from his experience as a former prosecutor characterized the criminaljustice system as in danger of coming to a halt  its system gridlock But he continued Before I favor an extreme measure that raises questions of the presumption of innocence I would like to see the system speeded up Kennedy Is CoSponsor A proposal for pretrial detention is included in the Violent Crime and Drug Enforcement Improvement Act a bill cosponsored by Senator DAmato and Senator Edward M Kennedy among others The measure would allow a judge to hold a defendant without bail if the judge considered the defendant a danger to society according to Jan Zagame one of Senator DAmatos aides Defendants with past criminal records those accused of drugrelated violent or capital crimes or those who might not appear at their trials could be subject to such detention he said Kenneth Conboy deputy police commissioner for legal matters testified at the hearing that New York already had a similar law but that judges had not exercised that power The Commissioners described successful robbery and arsonprevention programs including identification of career criminals creation of a central robbery unit an increase in neighborhood foot patrols and a Red Cap fire marshal program Program Reduces Arson Mr Hynes saying that the Red Cap program had reduced arson by 17 percent in target areas called for the creation of a federally financed program to fight arson in the nations 10 largest cities The program gets its name from the red caps worn by the 50 marshals who patrol designated neighborhoods A panel of smallstore owners and community leaders also testified at the hearing describing robberies and murders that terrorized their neighborhoods and forced many small businesses to close Josephine Scalici said she had run a jewelry store for 21 years with her husband until he was killed in a robbery A Time to Give Up You have to give up sometimes she said After something like that happens it doesnt make any sense to go on Mrs Scalici called for an end to plea bargaining and probation for first offenders and said that one of the men who robbed her store had a long record of felonies but had never been imprisoned What was he doing on the streets she asked Jeremiah OShea the director of the Flatbush Tenants Council described a citizen crime patrol that he said had substantially reduced burglaries Testifying that he advises tenants to buy the same lock for their lobby doors that is used in the Tombs prison he said Everyone feels as though theyre under siege on the barricades The Federal Government must provide leadership he continued I dont know where were going to go I have more questions than answers
"'SINCERELY YOURS,' YOUR CONGRESSMAN'S COMPUTER",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/us/sincerely-yours-your-congressman-s-computer.html,This spring when an effort to stiffen the terms of the divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company began in Congress some 2000 letters from ATT stockholders and employees flowed into the office of Representative Bill Nelson A member of Mr Nelsons staff wrote a single reply and computer printers dispatched freshly typed copies of it to all 2000 senders Mr Nelson a Florida Democrat who is something of a high technology buff did not let the matter rest there He instructed his staff to retain the names and addresses of the letter writers in the memory bank of his office computer and last month when the move to stiffen the ATT settlement with the Government was abandoned he sent out another 2000 letters with the news The computer printer just churned away said Jim Sutherland Mr Nelsons administrative assistant Mr Nelson is known as one of Capitol Hills most advanced practitioners of computer correspondence but such techniques now are being used widely here So much mail is generated and answered in this fashion in fact that Congressional correspondence is increasingly taking the form of computers answering letters written by computers Cant Just Count the Mail Long ago when the techniques of mass mailing were known only to Sears Roebuck and to the Selective Service members of Congress used their mailbags as a sort of an informal public opinion poll In recent years however the advances in direct mail technology have prompted members of Congress to talk in terms of the quality of their mail as well as the quantity You cant just count the mail anymore said Representative Melvin Price an Ilinois Democrat who has served 19 consecutive terms in the House The volume itself doesnt tell you anything The volume however has created a problem for Congressional staffs In 1970 before computer techniques were in wide use members of Congress received 15 million pieces of mail from their constituents Last year when the computer revolution was at flood tide some 300 million pieces of mail were sent to Congress by constituents The Congressional Management Foundation which provides consultant services for members of Congress estimates that 55 percent of all Congressional staff time is devoted to responding to mail Though more people than ever are writing their Congressmen there is less chance than ever that those people do anything more than affix their signatures The Congressional mailbag today is stuffed with computerprinted telegrams letters and postcards carrying messages written at computer terminals in consultants office suites rather than on the kitchen table The Instant Response Members of Congress in recent years have come to play down the significance of these mass computer mailings Even if I did look at them a whole pile of computerwritten letters or postcards wouldnt impress me as much as a single handwritten letter said Representative Norman D Shumway Republican of California Its not that I ignore them I just give them very low priority Mr Shumway is not alone The most effective piece of communication is a handwritten letter said Representative Dan Glickman Democrat of Kansas A computergenerated piece of mail is not worthless but its not worth very much either The computer revolution that made the deluge of computer postcards possible also facilitated the instant computerproduced response and today all but a few members of Congress employ a computer specialist to handle large portions of their mail In the process however the value of both letters to Congress and letters from Congress has been debased Its changed the value of mail said Representative E Kika de la Garza Democrat of Texas When you get two or three postcards on two or three issues from the same person at the same time you get the feeling that the issues werent important enough for them to sit down and write a letter Viguerie Defends Technique Organizations that have harnessed the power of the post take a different view however I keep hearing that all this mail doesnt have any effect but the votes indicate otherwise said Richard Viguerie the directmail expert of the new right They can say all they want that they dont pay attention to this mail but somehow or another the whole political thing has shifted to the conservative side Groups like the National Right to Life Committee which is credited with one of the most successful mail campaigns in recent years use the techniques of the computer age sparingly Theres no question that letters can affect policy but we stress the personal letter said Douglas Johnson legislative director for the committee Massproduced mail is not as productive as the personal letter Computer correspondence has in fact met considerable resistance on Capitol Hill One legislator who asked not to be identified had his office computer programmed to begin some letters with openings such as Thank you for your form letter and Thank you for your preprinted postcard Other members of Congress have spurned the computer trend altogether We dont need a computer and we dont have one said Representative William K Natcher a Kentucky Democrat who turns up at his office each morning at 7 to open the mail himself I dont need a set answer on prayers in the schools or on abortion The lady who writes a letter in longhand deserves a personal answer

FILIBUSTER STARTS ABORTION DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/us/filibuster-starts-abortion-debate.html,Proponents of access to abortion outflanked antiabortion forces in a parliamentary maneuver today as the Senate began a longawaited debate on the issue Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina offered a proposal clearing the way for Congress to restrict the availability of abortions But before Mr Helms had a chance to speak on the subject Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon got the floor and began reading from a book on the history of abortion in America Mr Packwood is leading the forces that want to retain the abortion availability that now exists Aides to the Senator said that he was willing to keep up his filibuster as long as necessary to forestall new restrictions on abortion Todays events followed the breakdown of efforts to negotiate an agreement for a week of debate on the issue The Senate hopes to begin its Labor Day recess in two weeks Weeks Debate Was Expected To cut off the filibuster senators opposed to abortion could try to invoke cloture the parliamentary means of closing debate which requires votes from 60 of the 100 senators After cloture the Senate may spend up to 100 hours on an issue Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee the majority leader said today that he expected to spend the entire week on the question The debate would be the Senates most extensive discussion of the issue since the Supreme Courts 1973 ruling on a womans right to choose an abortion Senator Helms calls abortion killing unborn human life He has in the past offered several proposals that would prohibit use of Federal money for abortion and declare that huamn life exists from the moment of conception This time Mr Helms is offering an amendment to a bill increasing the Federal debt ceiling The amendment saying nothing about abortion would merely add a heading Title II to the debt ceiling bill Then the estrictions on abortion could be offered as an amendment to the amendment Senate aides suggested that Mr Helms had taken this approach because under Senate rules the second amendment would not be subject to further amendment and so it could not be weakened Mr Packwoods press secretary Etta Fielek said that several other senators were willing to support Mr Packwoods efforts if necessary Among them she said are Senators Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania both Republicans and Paul E Tsongas of Massachusetts Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio and Max Baucus of Montana Democrats Ordinarily a senator who offers a bill or an amendment is the first person recognized to speak on it But after Senator Helms offered his amendment today Senator Packwood rose and was recognized by the presiding officer Mr Packwood controlled the floor for the rest of the day Mr Packwood walked around the floor of the Senate reading aloud from Abortion in America The Origins and Evolution of National Policy 18001900 by James C Mohr Senator Baker and other senators had tried to obtain an agreement limiting the debate to eight hours equally divided between supporters and opponents That agreement would have allowed another eight hours for debate on a constitutional amendment proposed by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah The Hatch proposal would permit Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortion Under the proposed consent agreement neither the Helms nor the Hatch proposal would have been open to amendment Mr Helms apparently refused to go along with the agreement because he wanted the right to amend his proposal should he need to attract additional support for it All the Helms proposals would prohibit the use of Federal money for abortions except in those cases where the life of a pregnant woman would be endangered by denial Congress has attached similar restrictions to appropriations bills in each of the last five years the Helms proposal would make the restrictions permanent
"DEMURELY, THE RUSSIANS LAUNCH SEX EDUCATION",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/world/demurely-the-russians-launch-sex-education.html,With a coyness that might be familiar to Americans who grew up in the 1950s Soviet high schools have begun the first largescale experiment in sex education a topic that was once taboo and that still raises the hackles of many parents and bureaucrats Since last fall 15 schools in Moscow and smaller numbers of schools in cities elsewhere in the country have been offering classes to students of both sexes in the eighth ninth and tenth grades who would be mostly 14 to 16yearolds Initial reports on the experiment appearing in the Soviet press suggest that the pioneers must still tread warily for fear of reviving charges that their efforts endanger the morality of Soviet youth A recent report in the weekly Nedelya gave some of the moralistic flavor of the undertaking The writer Yelena Mushkina sat in on one of the classes for eighthgrade girls at School 146 in Moscows Frunze Borough which has led the way in the city by opening seven of its schools to the new classes The account quoted approvingly from the opening observation of the instructor a female doctor from a local clinic You girls are future wives but unfortunately you know very little about your bodies the doctor A Yakushina advised So I want to talk about how one should treat ones health and how to protect it And about maidenly honor if you lose it youll be in a lot of trouble Program Is Still Restricted It has taken educational innovators psychologists and sociologists 20 years of lobbying and writing scholarly articles to win approval for what in a nation of 40 million schoolchildren is still a very restricted program Formal strictures against bourgeois licentiousness remain in force and it is the projection of these official attitudes into the educational sphere that has complicated the efforts of reformers to get sex classes onto the curriculum The concessions that allowed the experimental program to proceed were made only when a mounting body of data published in demographic and sociological academic journals showed that the country was experiencing a disturbingly high incidence of divorce venereal disease and teenage pregnancies which account for a majority of nearly half a million births that occur out of wedlock each year Across the country nearly a third of all marriages end in divorce and some sociologists believe the figure to be as high as 50 percent in Moscow and other major cities And although a study in Leningrad five years ago rated drunkenness among husbands almost on a par with infidelity as a cause of marital breakdown more recent surveys have suggested that sexual dissatisfaction is a factor in as many as twothirds of all cases The fact that a third of all divorces occur within a year of the wedding has been taken as further evidence of the need for formal sex guidance for adolescents Those pressing for sex classes succeeded first in Estonia which has had such classes in all its schools for 15 years and later in the two other Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania After years of discussion the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences drew up a pilot program and put it on test in a handful of Moscow schools but the lack of properly trained teachers led to some early debacles One example was quoted in a 1979 article in Komsomolskaya Pravda the newspaper of the Young Communist League which described what happened when a biology teacher in Kaliningrad was entrusted with sex instruction She read the appropriate literature and prepared a lecture that seemed to her to lie within the reach of her childrens understanding the newspaper said But no sooner had the poor teacher begun to speak than she was deluged with the most inconceivable fantastic and absurd questions based on barnyard anecdotes and idle conjectures The teachers face flooded with color and she bolted from the classroom On that note the sad experiment came to its end In recent articles on the broader experiment under way in Moscow academic proponents have felt the need to hammer home the case for the classes with batteries of statistics on the incidence of premarital sex accompanied by gloomy prognostications of the effect on the country if the trend is allowed to go unchecked Dr IS Kon a Leningrad ethnographer wrote in a recent issue of Sotsiologicheskiye Issledovaniya a sociological journal that to a substantial degree young people today separate sexual involvement from the intent to marry He supported his argument with the results of a survey among 3700 Leningrad high school students the largest group of whom 37 percent gave love as the reason for sex Only 7 percent gave intent to marry as the reason Dr Kon cited statistics showing that the number of children conceived before marriage was rising sharply  23 percent in 1968 28 percent in 1973 and 38 percent in 1978 He said that this should be a matter for public concern since it led to unwanted babies unwed mothers and juvenile parents Nonetheless he said there is still a tendency to treat the subject of sexual relations with what Engels called false petitbourgeois modesty There are parents and teachers who oppose sex education in schools on the ground that biology courses provide all that is necessary and that our ancestors got along fine without that knowledge he noted They got along fine without electricity airplanes and television too but we neither can nor wish to do without them Dr Kon retorted In fact he argued contemporary Soviet children may be worse off when it comes to learning about sex than their grandparents generation Although peasant children didnt use to receive any scientific sex education he said they were less naive than todays schoolchildren adult life went on right in front of them and besides all ethnic groups had rituals that served the function of sex education Nowadays what substitute is there for this folk learning Parents shun the subject and popular literature is published in such limited editions that it doesnt come close to meeting the demand In the article describing the experimental class in Moscows Frunze Borough the Nedelya writer registered her own reservations plainly She recalled attending a family life lecture in Lithuania by one of the republics leading neuropathologists Ceslavas Grizickas in which the conversation went to the limit of what one can say aloud Now she said the topic has been brought into the eighth grade in which one must literally weigh every word  theyre only 15 years old and one must speak in a manner that leaves nothing confused or unclear otherwise theyll look for additional information on their own A Change of Views Parents worrying about their childrens being corrupted would find solace in the attitudes of one of the principal forces behind the new program an educational psychologist named AG Khripkova After a 1979 trip to observe sex education classes in Sweden she told Komsomolskaya Pravda that she had been shocked I returned from this trip with much more rightwing views she said Whereas I had previously favored a more intensive program of sex education in our schools the experience in Sweden brought me to reconsider my views The influence of such thinking is evident in the glimpses of the curriculum that have appeared in the Soviet press In a country where women have an average of eight abortions in their childbearing years and where pregnancies can be ended on demand at a cost of less than 10 the girls in the Moscow schools have been told that interrupting a pregnancy is harmful to their health Heavy emphasis has been laid on the loss of honor involved in premarital sex and in one case chronicled by Nedelya ninthgrade girls were invited to criticize a hypothetical 30yearold bachelor who celebrates his freedom to invite any girl out to a movie to dinner  no obligations no worries The teacher Nedelya said directed the conversation to the problem of loneliness moral purity and the supreme joy of becoming a father
ABORTION DEBATE DELAYS FLOOR VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/us/abortion-debate-delays-floor-vote.html,Senator Jesse Helms said today that he hoped the appeal of a Labor Day recess would help break a filibuster by liberals and lead to a Senate vote this week on the antiabortion measure he is sponsoring The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee used the weekly Republican caucus to try to prod Mr Helms a North Carolina Republican into working out an agreement with Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon who is filibustering against the Helms bill Im sure Senator Packwood is aware of the desire of senators who feel the need to go home for the Labor Day recess Senator Helms said in an interview He indicated he believed the impasse would be broken by Friday Packwood Says He Can Block Vote But Senator Packwood said he had the support of Senators Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio Arlen Specter Democrat of Pennsylvania and others to head off a vote on the most farreaching antiabortion legislation since the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion The measure is in the form of an amendment to the bill on the national debt ceiling which the Senate must pass if the Government is to keep functioning It would ban direct and indirect Federal financing and Federal insurance coverage for abortions and encourage an early review of the Supreme Court decision Mr Helms deleted a section of the original amendment that would have defined human life as starting at conception intended to give fetuses due process rights under the 14th Amendment He retained the language in the bills introductory findings where it could have no force of law Mr Helms said that if he had retained the personhood definition the measure would have got only 35 to 40 votes He now claims solid support for the revised bill among Senators who oppose abortion Some liberals said they felt some senators would have voted against a measure with the personhood definition because of its uncertain legal implications Filibustering Two Days Mr Packwood seized the floor Monday preventing Mr Helms from introducing the amendment and continued to hold it today when the Senate resumed deliberation on the debt limit bill He filibustered for two hours and 20 minutes Monday by reading a book on the history of abortion Mr Packwood said he had mounted his filibuster because he felt that while he might have been able to defeat legislation that included a human life clause he realized he probably could not defeat the Helms amendment in its present weaker form Mr Helms also decided not to include in the amendment a rider that would have overturned the 1962 Supreme Court ruling that outlawed prayer in public He said he hoped the voluntary prayer issue would come up for a Senate vote in September In each of the past six years Congress has passed a rider prohibiting the Federal financing of virtually all abortions a provision aimed mainly at welfare mothers Mr Helmss amendment would make this permanent
PURISTS AND PRAGMATISTS SPLIT ON G.O.P.'S AGENDA,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/us/purists-and-pragmatists-split-on-gop-s-agenda.html,The fight within the Republican Party over the plan now before Congress to raise taxes by 983 billion has illuminated a deeper and more enduring split that divides Republicans on many issues from the economy to abortion to foreign aid How that split is resolved could seriously influence President Reagans relationship with Capitol Hill during the rest of his stay in office In basic terms the split really divides two kinds of Republican conservatives ideologues versus pragmatists purists versus compromisers those who want the whole loaf versus those who will settle for a grilled cheese on toast Representative Barber B Conable Jr a conservative Republican from upstate New York who fits clearly in the pragmatic camp thinks that the key to the split lies in the basic aims of the two groups Many ideologues are more interested in issues than in governing he said Theyre trying to lead thought into the right channels Thats more important to them than the disorderly business of managing the Government By its very nature you get your hands dirty when you try to seek a consensus Tax Bill an Economic Aspirin This division was obscured during the first 18 months of the Reagan regime by the lingering euphoria produced by the victories of 1980 and the remarkable devotion to the Presidents program on the part of virtually all Republicans But now it has been brought into focus by the slumping economy which has created doubts about Mr Reagans economic approach and caused some pragmatists to look for new answers A good example is Representative Henry J Hyde a conservative Republican from Illinois who generally favors the new tax bill Im still a devout supplysider he insisted but the time factor has now stretched out longer than any of us wanted So what do you do The tax bill is kind of an economic aspirin In addition the sheer experience of running the Government of getting their hands dirty has affected the Reagan White House and the Republican leadership on the Hill Theyre at this major crossroads right now said Representative Tony Coelho of California head of the Democratic Campaign Committee The Republicans have been a minority party for years and they were able to be true ideologues without governing But you cant run a Government with ideologues The conflict between Republican conservatives has shown up in many areas in recent months including these  The proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget Rightwing ideologues led by Senator William L Armstrong of Colorado pushed through a change in the Senate that would make it much harder for Congress to borrow money and raise the national debt Supporters of the amendment in the House led by Mr Conable were furious feeling that such a provision might pass the Republicancontrolled Senate but could sink the amendment in the Democratic House  Social issues Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina a hero to the right wing is pushing Senate debate on such emotional topics as abortion and prayer in schools Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Republican leader a consummate pragmatist has tried to keep these issues buried on the ground that Congress and the White House should focus on economic issues  Debt ceiling and balanced budget As a candidate Mr Reagan opposed budget deficits and higher debt ceilings as President he has been forced to endorse both But his more conservative critics consider this shift a sellout  Foreign aid Here again the prePresidential Reagan excoriated foreign aid as a liberal boondoggle But when he had to maintain relations with governments around the world he decided much to the horror of his old friends to ask for even higher foreign aid expenditures  Extension of unemployment benefits Ideologues in the White House opposed any extension until practical politicians on Capitol Hill told them that supporting benefits was essential for survival this fall But no issue illustrates the division better than that of taxes mainly because it is such a critical element of the conservative agenda Some lawmakers embrace the gospel of supplyside economics which considers lower taxes the key to greater investment and growth And to a devout supplysider tax increases would be fatal to the economy An Expression of Experience Moreover many conservatives strongly believe that their only chance of dismantling the social welfare state is to starve the Government by cutting taxes Raising taxes they fear would only fuel social spending and keep alive the programs they want to kill In describing this faction within his own party Representative Robert Michel the Republican leader called them ideologues who couldnt bend themselves around a corner at any time But the degree of commitment to a set of ideas is not the only distinction between the warring factions Its more an expression of experience than anything else said Mr Conable A lot come to Congress and feel a sense of mission but they underestimate the complexity of Government Youll find that most of the pragmatic people have been around for awhile The New York Republican also fears that some of the Presidents more acerbic critics have not understood their hero very well Ronald Reagan has always had a capacity to live his life in segments the rhetorical segment and the real world Mr Conable said referring to Mr Reagans decision to reverse course and go for the 983 billion tax increase I find that some groups are trapped by Ronald Reagans rhetoric and dont follow his actions Conservative lobbying groups outside Congress also play an important role by whipping up ideological fury and pressing lawmakers to stick to their purebred precepts Interestingly the tax revolt of hardline conservatives occurred at the same time that Conservative Digest a major voice on the right had a cover article proclaiming the growing conservative disappointment with the President Some of these outside groups cant survive unless theyre in opposition to whoever is in power said a member of the Republican leadership in the House They cant be viable organizations unless theyre involved in a struggle and in this case the struggle is to preserve Ronald Reagans purity
FOES OF ABORTION LOSE SENATE TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/us/foes-of-abortion-lose-senate-test.html,Conservative forces led by Senator Jesse Helms lost a key test vote today as the Senate conducted an impassioned debate on abortion and school prayer The North Carolina Republican offered proposals to restrict access to abortion and to bar Supreme Court review of state laws permitting officially sanctioned prayer in public schools The opponents of the proposals denounced the effort to limit the authority of the High Court They vowed to speak as long as necessary to forestall Senate action on the moves A test came today By a vote of 59 to 38 the Senate defeated Mr Helmss motion to kill another Senators proposal that would undercut his own Todays debate focused frequently on the propriety of Congressional action to restrict the Supreme Court Republicans and Democrats alike said that such action was improper and could set a precedent that would come back to haunt the conservatives We have before us the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York shouted from his desk in the back of the Senate It is a crisis which has already forced the Senate into extended debate and none should doubt that this debate will continue until New Years Eve and the expiration of this Congress if it must be Warns of Congress Guilt Mr Moynihan said that Congress would be guilty of an abomination if it directed its rage and irresponsible fury against the Supreme Court If the Court is to be a subordinate branch of the US Government of the US Congress he said then we are no longer the Republic founded at Philadelphia in 1787 Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama said that the school prayer proposal was not an attempt to undermine the Constitution He said that the Founding Fathers would be spinning in their graves if they knew that we have arrived at a point in the history of this one nation under God at which no prayer is permitted in our public schools Senator Helms and Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon the Senates foremost opponent of restrictions on abortion vied for recognition as the Senate concluded its routine morning business The President pro tem Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina recognized Mr Helms who then offered his school prayer amendment It says that the Court shall not have jurisdiction to review any state law or regulation which relates to voluntary prayers in public schools and public buildings The proposal would also forbid Federal district courts to hear such cases Helms Offers Amendment Senator Helms then offered an antiabortion amendment which states that scientific evidence demonstrates the life of each human being begins at conception It also says that the Supreme Court erred in its 1973 decision guaranteeing women access to abortion The Helms proposal would give permanent form to the prohibitions on Federal financing of abortions enacted in each of the last five years It would also authorize a direct appeal to the Supreme Court if any Federal judge struck down a state law restricting abortions Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut then offered a proposal reaffirming the authority of Federal courts to enforce the Constitution notwithstanding other provisions of the bill Mr Helms moved immediately to kill the Weicker proposal This was the motion rejected by the Senate Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana moved to support Mr Weicker by offering another proposal that said The Federal courts must remain open to litigants whose claims arise out of the Federal Constitution Headed Toward Gridlock Senator Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania told his colleagues that the nation was headed toward gridlock and ultimately toward anarchy if Congress stripped Federal courts of their power to review certain types of cases Asked whether Mr Helms had lost control of the debate that he initiated Mr Specter said in an interview Everybody has lost control The whole process is out of control People want to know where we stand on the issues People want us to get on with the business of the country The abortion and school prayer proposals were offered by Mr Helms as amendments to a measure increasing the Federal debt ceiling Congress must act on the debt ceiling before the next fiscal year begins on Oct 1 Senate leaders said that the Senate might have to defer action on the debt ceiling until next month after the Labor Day recess if the debate on abortion and school prayer continues But Senator Weicker said that he was willing to filibuster through the time scheduled for the Labor Day recess if necessary to block action on the Helms proposals We are not in such a hurry that we are going to leave the Constitution behind and go sit on a beach he said The Constitution is the origin of everything good and great that we have in this country Even if the Senate approved one of the Helms proposals it would face many obstacles in the House where Democrats form a majority Encouraged by the tactical advantage he held this evening Senator Packwood said There is no chance now that prayer busing or abortion  any of the limitations that the right wing wants to pass will go anywhere in this session

COURT TELLS JERSEY TO PAY FOR THERAPEUTIC ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/nyregion/court-tells-jersey-to-pay-for-therapeutic-abortions.html,The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled today that the state must provide Medicaid funds for all abortions that are medically necessary to preserve a mothers life or health but not for elective abortions In its ruling the court held that a state law prohibiting Medicaid from paying for abortions except when necessary to preserve the mothers life was constitutionally defective The court held that the statute violated the State Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law because it permitted payments for necessary medical care for childbirth but not for medically necessary abortions By so ruling the court saved the law from having to be reenacted The decision recognizes rights under the New Jersey Constitution that were not supported in a United States Supreme Court decision in 1980 The 1980 ruling held that a Federal law prohibiting Medicaid funds for abortions except to save the mothers life did not violate the United States Constitution Cites US Court on Rights The New Jersey court today noted however that the United States Supreme Court has held that state constitutions may provide more expansive protection of individual liberties than the United States Constitution Justice Stewart G Pollock who wrote the majority opinion for the New Jersey court said Although the State Constitution may encompass a smaller universe than the Federal Constitution our constellation of rights may be more complete Four other state justices concurred in the majority opinion Justice Daniel OHern dissented and Justice Morris Pashman concurred but said the majority was wrong in limiting financing to medically necessary abortions He said the same rights recognized by the court should cover cases where women simply decide to terminate a pregnancy There is no medically valid distinction between therapeutic abortions and socalled elective abortions Justice Pashman said The decision insures that Medicaid funds will be available for poor patients whose ability to obtain abortions was dramatically affected by the limiting statute Justice Pollock said testimony in the court hearings showed that while the statute was in effect births to women eligible for Medicaid had increased by 30 percent but the number of Medicaidfinanced abortions declined from a monthly average of more than 900 to fewer than 25 Litigation Began in 1978 The court case arose in 1978 when several groups led by the Right to Choose organization challenged the state statute in the Chancery Division of Superior Court The plaintiffs said the statute violated the Medicaid Act as well as the State and Federal Constitutions Initially the court rejected the constitutional arguments but said the state law conflicted with the Federal Medicaid Act and constituted a breach of the states obligation to provide its share of funds for medically necessary services The state then adopted new regulations patterned after a 1977 amendment to the Federal law that broadened the Medicaid coverage for abortion to include victims of rape or incest or cases where severe and longlasting physical harm to the mother would result from carrying the pregnancy to term The chancery court ruled these regulations violated the plaintiffs rights to equal protection because they discriminated against women with a medical necessity for an abortion but whose condition did not meet the new standards The court ordered the state to finance all Medicaid abortions except elective nontherapeutic abortions Rules on Financing Changed The State Department of Human Services then promulgated new regulations to permit payment for all medically necessary abortions The determination of medical necessity included consideration of such factors as age family reasons and physical emotional and psychological factors Shortly after however the United States Supreme Court handed down its 1980 decision approving a Federal provision limiting funds for abortions to lifethreatening situations which overturned the chancery court decision insofar as it was based on an interpretation of rights protected by the Federal Constitution Appeals were filed with the Appellate Division of Superior Court but the New Jersey Supreme Court took up the case immediately By construing the statute to cover all medically necessary abortions the court saved the law from being struck down because of its constitutional defect
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/books/books-of-the-times-092322.html,LANA The Lady the Legend the Truth By Lana Turner Illustrated 311 pages EP Dutton Inc 1495 HAROLD ROBBINS has already given us one potboiler version of the Lana Turner story Now Miss Turner herself has provided another one thats a lot more believable and possibly spicier Its not every actress who can outRobbins Mr Robbins But Lana Turner though she isnt reflective or articulate even by moviestar standards has led a life thats a soapopera daydream And shes got a oneofakind Hollywood story to tell After all in Mr Robbinss Where Love Has Gone the thinly disguised story of a sculptress whose daughter apparently kills her mothers lover much as Miss Turners daughter Cheryl Crane was accused of stabbing the gangster Johnny Stompanato becomes material for an entire novel That story is also part of Lana The Lady the Legend the Truth But Miss Turner has had such a busy life that the Stompanato murder constitutes only a couple of chapters in her story There are numerous other lovers not to mention seven husbands and the vicissitudes of a glamour girls screen career to be dealt with here Miss Turner begins the book on a note of histrionic candor The press has misrepresented her time and again she says adding I refuse to leave this earth with that pile of moviemagazine trash scandal and slander as my epitaph So now Im ready to share what Ive always kept private to set the record straight As youll see Im willing to tell it all Never mind that the first revelation she then makes is that shes actually one year younger than shes supposed to be by her count she is now 61 years old For the most part her book sounds candid and convincing and she appears to be keeping her promise Her first marriage at 19 was to the bandleader Artie Shaw with whom she eloped to Las Vegas on their very first date Her last was to Ronald Dante a hip hypnotist considerably younger than she Mr Dante simply disappeared one day while the two of them were visiting San Franciso and just after Miss Turner had made out a 35000 check in his name Later while Miss Turner was on vacation in Palm Springs Calif he called to make amends and to ask her how long shed be away Three or four days she replied When she returned Miss Turner says 100000 worth of jewelry was missing Why was I always attracted to the wrong man Why did I always end up the patsy Miss Turner asks herself frequently during the course of her memoir She doesnt come up with an answer Instead she tells of bad judgment after bad judgment with no attraction more fatal of course than hers to Mr Stompanato He was John Steele when she met him or at least that was how he introduced himself By the time she found out otherwise she was both enthralled by and afraid of him a number of men have been physically violent with her but by her account it was Mr Stompanato who gave her the most serious beating The year Miss Turner was nominated for an Oscar for Peyton Place was the year her 14yearold daughter Cheryl Crane stabbed and killed Mr Stompanato in her mothers boudoir The murder is described with a luridness that would do Mr Robbins proud but there are unexpectedly homey touches too As Miss Turner and Mr Stompanato quarreled bitterly the actress heard the tinkle of her daughters charm bracelet outside the dressingroom door She repeatedly warned the girl to go back to her room but the sound of the bracelet didnt cease In addition to the bracelet her daughter also carried a carving knife  but the knife didnt make any noise Among the other things the reader may learn about Miss Turner that she wasnt discovered at Schwabs drugstore the legend notwithstanding That her eyebrows havent grown back since they were shaved for The Adventures of Marco Polo That she was deflowered by a beau of Joan Crawfords and then given quite a scolding by Miss Crawford herself That Tyrone Power was the man she loved best even though she lost him That she seemed to know nothing of the backgrounds of any of the men she married and that when one of them made an extravagant gesture  like Bob Topping her third husband who proposed by hiding a 15carat diamond in her martini glass or presenting a diamond necklace by tying it onto a pet poodle  her heart was much too easily won That when she married Mr Topping the hotel sent breakfast the next morning and Hedda Hopper arrived uninvited to interview the newlyweds When they opened the door Miss Hopper had eaten most of the breakfast and was just polishing off the coffee There are more serious things Miss Turner attempted suicide though studio publicity agents later said she had slashed her wrists by tripping in the shower She had two abortions and gave birth to several stillborn babies Her only daughters waywardness was a mystery to her and so was the trick that her mother played when Miss Turner was still Julia Jean Turner of Wallace Idaho One day as mother and little daughter watched a train go by Mildred Turner pointed to a woman in elegant white gloves and made the child wave to this stranger and blow her a kiss That is your real mother Miss Turners real mother explained The child remembers screaming and crying in confusion Years later Mrs Turner whose daughter was enormously devoted to her said she never knew why she had played such a trick on the child For her daughter too there are things of great importance that are not now and may never be understood

Mr. Helms Plays Dodgem,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/20/opinion/mr-helms-plays-dodgem.html,People want to know where we stand on the issues said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania during this weeks Congressional battle on abortion People should address their complaints to Senator Jesse Helms Thanks to him Americans whod been promised an orderly discussion of his Human Life Statute and Senator Hatchs constitutional amendment permitting the states and Congress to prohibit abortion were treated to the spectacle of a Senator turning debate into dodgem First Senator Helms reneged on his previous agreement to a schedule of time limits for debate on the abortion issue He announced that he wanted to withdraw his statute and Senator Hatchs amendment in favor of a new measure But he waited until Wednesday to disclose just what it was It turned out to proclaim that scientific evidence demonstrates that life begins at conception and that the Supreme Court had erred in 1973 when it permitted abortion His proposal also severely restricted womens access to the procedure It was coupled with a ban on court review of state laws sanctioning prayer in public schools The whole business was linked to the debtceiling bill Senator Helms seriously overestimated his ability to steer To introduce his measure he managed to break a filibuster by Senator Packwood the Senates foremost supporter of abortion rights But he was promptly bumped back by Senators Weicker and Baucus who offered amendments designed to move the debate off the substance of abortion and school prayer and onto the constitutionality of what Senator Helms was trying to do Senator Helms tried to table Senator Weickers amendment but was outvoted by colleagues who were by now thoroughly miffed at the way he was flouting accepted procedure the Baucus amendment has yet to be acted on So for now gridlock reigns Senators Packwood and Helms cannot even agree on how to limit debate The Senate needs to get on to other matters senators who might support the new Helms abortion proposal do not necessarily endorse his school prayer proposal and besides everybody wants to go home for the Labor Day recess It is probably just as well that no action seems likely until September when another long filibuster looms But Senator Helmss effort to turn the Senate into bumper cars can hardly reassure voters on any side of the issue

BAKER SETS VOTE AFTER LABOR DAY ON ENDING FILIBUSTER ON ABORTION AND SCHOOL PRAYER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/21/us/baker-sets-vote-after-labor-day-ending-filibuster-abortion-school-prayer.html,The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr moved today to end a filibuster on abortion and school prayer by filing a petition to invoke cloture when the Senate returns from its Labor Day recess A cloture motion can be approved only if 60 of the 100 Senators vote for it The petition signed by 18 Senators seeks to shut off debate on a proposal by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would give permanent form to numerous prohibitions on the use of Federal money for abortions Similar restrictions have been attached as riders to appropriation bills in each of the last five years but the legal force of such restrictions expires at the end of each fiscal year The Helms proposal also declares as a finding by Congress that the life of each human being begins at conception Hatchs Related Proposal Mr Baker a Tennessee Republican said that he would permit at least eight hours of debate on a related proposal by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah Mr Hatch wants to amend the Constitution by adding this provision A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution The Congress and the several states shall have the concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortions Mr Helms and Mr Hatch maintain that the Supreme Court erred in 1973 when it ruled that women should have access to abortion by virtue of the constitutionally protected right to privacy The Hatch proposal would overturn the decision with a constitutional amendment which needs approval by twothirds of each house of Congress and by the Legislatures of threefourths of the states The Helms proposal by contrast would limit the effectiveness of the High Courts decision by a statute which can be enacted by a simple majority in each house of Congress Another proposal by Mr Helms also pending before the Senate would bar the Supreme Court from reviewing state laws that permit officially sanctioned prayer in public schools The Court in 1962 and 1963 forbade such prayer saying it violated First Amendment guarantees of freedom of religion Republicans Lead Filibuster A halfdozen Senators led by Bob Packwood of Oregon and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut both Republicans have been waging a filibuster against the Helms proposals In an interview today Senator Helms outlined his strategy and objectives I feel like Ive done my duty he said I promised my supporters that I would do my best to see that the Senate had a clean shot at a vote on both questions abortion and school prayer This is as good a shot as I could have had I have just surrendered the floor to Mr Packwood and his colleagues I want them to have every opportunity to say the things they want to say specious as they may be The Senate is scheduled to return from its recess on Sept 8 Mr Baker said that he hoped to limit debate on the Hatch amendment to Sept 8 and 9 The Senate would vote on the cloture motion Sept 9 he said Mr Helms said I doubt very seriously that well get cloture the first time because a number of senators will be on foreign trips Mr Helms said that he would try again if necessary to invoke cloture Support will increase he said as the Senate holds allnight sessions and as Oct 1 approaches The abortion and prayer proposals are amendments to a measure that increases the Federal debt ceiling for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 Action Would Be Required Congress must act on the debt ceiling measure so that the Government can meet its legal and financial obligations Senator Helms criticized the Planned Parenthood Federation of America which has been in the forefront of lobbying against further restrictions on abortion I would like to find one iota of intellectual honesty on this issue in the Planned Parenthood crowd Mr Helms said in the interview today They are spreading utter falsehoods He complained in particular about a newspaper advertisement that showed a Senator in bed with a man and a woman The advertisement warned The decision to have a baby could soon be between you your husband and your Senator The Helms and Hatch proposals it said could deprive you of your most fundamental personal rights Mr Helms said that the advertisement was misleading because no one is going into anyones bedroom He also said that it was an outrageous falsehood for Planned Parenthood to suggest that a woman could be prosecuted for murder if she had a miscarriage Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood said in an interview that the possibility of prosecution was one of the huge questions raised by a human life statute defining when life begins The newspaper advertisement she said symbolically made the point that the Helms and Hatch proposals would permit the Government to interfere in private personal decisions on moral issues I dont see that as intellectually dishonest she said We are saying that this is no place for the Government to be
"PHOTOGRAPH VIEW;
UNWITTING PIONEER OF THE CANDID STYLE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/22/arts/photograph-view-unwitting-pioneer-of-the-candid-style.html,Tere is something surprising about Joe Steinmetzs photographs in the book Killing Time Godine 995 Stylistically they are as uptodate as anything shown at the Museum of Modern Art during the past decade But the hairdos makeup and clothes of the people depicted in them indicate that they were taken in the 1950s the 40s even as long ago as the 30s And the information given by Barbara P Norfleet in her introduction to Killing Time indicates that Steinmetz was not an avantgarde photographer three or four decades ahead of his time but an oldfashioned studio photographer whose only claim to fame was that he invented the candid wedding album The style of Steinmetzs photographs is a style made famous by the party photographs of Lee Friedlander shown at the Modern in 1972 under the title of Gatherings and Garry Winogrand shown at the Modern in 1977 under the title Public Relations The roving photographer armed with a handheld camera and a flash looks for pictures at a party a political rally or an art show and when he sees one shoots from the hip The pictures that result are  by traditional standards  artistic abortions Figures are cut off at the edges in arbitrary or haphazard ways Figures are frozen in awkward poses with idiotic expressions on their faces The foreground is too brightly lighted while the background sinks into obscurity But by modern standards they are works of art because the emphasis is on the formal characteristics of the medium rather than on the message As John Szarkowski of the Museum of Modern Art pointed out as long ago as 1966 in his pioneering book and exhibition The Photographers Eye  and has since demonstrated over and over again in a brilliant series of exhibitions and books  such accidental effects are peculiarly characteristic of the photographic medium They are indeed the common bond uniting the school of contemporary art photographers headed by Friedlander and Winogrand that has grown up around Szarkowski and the Modern In Steinmetzs photographs the peculiar effects of candid photography are not as exaggerated as they are in the comparable photographs of Friedlander and Winogrand who pushed the characteristic effects of candid photography to bizarre new extremes There are no foreground figures looming up ghostly white and drained of all detail in Steinmetzs pictures as there are in some of Friedlanders pictures from Gatherings The jerky poses and cretinous expressions are not so extreme as in Winogrands Public Relations But all three photographers are working in the same style and the fact that Steinmetz a heretofore obscure studio photographer mastered it several decades before the stars of the Museum of Modern Art made it famous is a fact worth pondering Born in 1905 in suburban Philadelphia Steinmetz grew up in an upperclass world of debutante teas country club dances and society weddings and he became a professional photographer by accident In 1928 while traveling in Egypt he bought a Leica camera and on his return to Philadelphia he began just for fun taking pictures of his friends weddings and putting them into albums as wedding presents Then their friends saw the albums and began hiring him starting him on a career as the candid photographer of weddings debutante parties charity balls and other gatherings of the old moneyed families of Philadelphia After World War II Steinmetz moved to Sarasota Fla where he continued to photograph professionally until 1975 Florida offered him a radically different social and physical landscape and he began to take pictures of poolside patios retirement homes Tupperwear parties and people who lived in trailer camps and motels During this time it does not seem to have occurred to Steinmetz that he was a pioneering art photographer And indeed he was not The style of his candid work was merely that of any enterprising wedding photographer who took up the handheld camera as a normal part of his professional equipment Then as now the wedding photographer used a largeformat view camera on a tripod in the studio or in the clients house or church and carefully posed and lighted the bride and her wedding party to make pictures that would conform insofar as photographs can to standards of portraiture set by European painters in the 17th and 18th centuries But at a wedding party or at any kind of gathering where people are moving about a photographer using a small handheld camera is faced with a situation that has no precedent in painting and it leaves photographers with almost no artistic control over their work When candid cameras were new studio photographers like Steinmetz kept as much control as they could Some of his informal Philadelphia group shots are clearly posed  for instance the ladies in Eleanor Roosevelt hats and dresses sitting around a table at a Colonialstyle tavern and the coffeedrinking young ladies and gentlemen in formal evening dress Nos 12 and 13 in the book Often in Florida he seems to have eschewed real people in action for carefully posed models for instance in Longboat Key No 42 a beach scene that looks like it was taken to illustrate a real estate or tourist brochure But some of the Philadelphia party pictures for instance No 9 Early Man No 17 Merion Cricket Club No 23 Head Dress Ball and No 26 Wedding are true candid shots in which though the subjects may be aware of the photographer they are not seriously interrupting their party to pose for him In photographs like these the photographer may wish to glorify his sitters and compose his picture as carefully as Watteau or Fragonard but he cannot He has to be satisfied with shooting the main subject any way he can even if this leaves aristocratic Philadelphians looking like gibbering idiots and letting the rest go hang The result is a style that is truly modern and truly photographic a style that though developed 30 or 40 years earlier is fully comparable to that of Friedlander Winogrand and their followers Indeed the only real difference between Steinmetzs style and theirs is that they deliberately strove for it while he had it thrust upon him whether he wanted it or not This is a piddling difference considering the quality of his work
"STATE ASSEMBLY'S DEMOCRATS TRY TO DOMINATE, AS REPUBLICANS TRY TO SURVIVE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/22/nyregion/state-assembly-s-democrats-try-to-dominate-as-republicans-try-to-survive.html,For Democrats this years elections represent a chance to establish almost unshakable control over the State Assembly For Republicans the Assembly elections will be a fight for survival The Democrats have controlled the Assembly since the 1974 elections following the Watergate scandals To the surprise of many Republicans  and some Democrats  that Democratic majority has prevailed since And in recent years the Democrats have had a series of surprising election victories in what had been considered solidly Republican areas Earlier this year the Democrats elected Patrick Halpin to a Suffolk County seat thought to be firmly in Republican hands In 1981 the Democrats elected Louis Freda in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn  regarded as one of the most staunchly Republican areas in New York City Effects of Redistricting Noted Complicating the Republicans task this year are the redrawn legislative district lines The Assembly lines were drawn largely by the Democrats just as the Republican majority in the State Senate drew the lines in that house But the changes in the Assembly were substantial In the Senate the Republicans were merely refining boundaries they themselves had drawn a decade earlier In the Assembly however the Democrats substantially changed boundaries that had been designed  unsuccessfully it turned out  to guarantee Republican hegemony With the reapportionment were going to have to put up a little defense said Assemblyman Clarence D Rappleyea Jr a Norwich Republican who is heading his partys election efforts He said he expects 1982 to be a difficult year for his party There are some things we cant control he said The economy for example Seats From City Imperiled In the meantime the Democrats who have an 88to62 edge over the Republicans  have endangered the seats of all but one of the seven Republican Assembly members from New York City And by substantially redrawing the states political map they have created seats in normally Republican areas on Long Island and upstate that are without incumbents thereby creating opportunities for Democrats In addition a number of veteran Republican legislators are retiring including Assemblymen Willis H Stephens of Brewster and Clark C Wemple of Schenectady Dale E Rath of Brockport L Steven Riford of Auburn and Dean G Skelos of Rockville Centre are all seeking State Senate seats In the 1980 elections the Republicans launched a wellfinanced wellorganized effort to reduce the Democrats majority They conducted a series of campaigns synchronized with President Reagans attack on the Democrats nationally emphasizing the need to cut taxes and reduce government spending While the Republicans were running campaigns built essentially on statewide themes the Democrats ran a series of local campaigns focusing heavily on local issues the strengths of their local candidates and the weaknesses of their Republican adversaries Upstate Democrats for example often disagreed with the Democratic Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink in his opposition to capital punishment and his support for Medicaid financing of abortions for indigent women Anthony Genovesi a senior aide to Mr Fink who planned the Democratic campaign took advantage of these and other conservative positions taken by his partys candidates particularly in upstate districts Following are some of the key races this year New York City Reapportionment has created a series of freeforall contests across the city with primaries developing on the Democratic side and with virtually all of the Republican incumbents facing difficult races The only Republican who appears to be safe is Staten Islands Robert A Stranieri The seat of Brooklyns only Republican Assembly member Florence M Sullivan was dismantled and Mrs Sullivan is running for the United States Senate Republicans may mount a major effort against Assemblyman Freda Incumbent Democrats Helene E Weinstein and Harry Smoler face each other in a primary as a result of redistricting and there is a primary battle for a new Brooklyn seat designed for the election of a Hispanic candidate Incumbent Assemblymen Joseph R Lentol and Joseph Ferris also face primaries On Staten Island a new seat has been created and it is regarded as a tossup though Mr Genovesi said Democrats should be able to take the seat Manhattan is relatively free of tough Assembly races but the Bronx Mr Genovesi said is a war zone Two white Democratic incumbents Sean P Walsh and Vincent A Marchiselli have been reapportioned into districts that are predominantly black or Hispanic Both face a number of minority opponents however and could survive because of a split in the minority vote Two Hispanic Assemblymen from the South Bronx Louis Nine and Armando Montano have been put into the same district because of the loss of population in their areas And Assemblyman Jose E Serrano faces a challenge from several canidates including Mr Montanos son Armando Montano Jr Two other white Assemblymen John C Dearie a Democrat and Guy J Velella the only Republican Assembly member from the Bronx have also been reapportioned into the same district and a spirited race is expected there In Queens Andrew Jenkins a Democrat is running for the State Senate and a primary battle is developing in his Assembly district Assemblyman John T Flack a Republican faces Assemblyman Fredrick D Schmidt Democrat Assemblyman John A Esposito a Republican is seeking reelection in a radically redrawn district that includes a large minority population Assemblyman Douglas W Prescott another Republican could also face difficulties because of reapportionment And reapportionment drove Republican John G LoPresto to retirement Long Island The Democrats have created a new seat in Suffolk Countys northern fork and believe thay have a strong candidate in William W Pell 3d The Republicans have nominated Joseph Sawicki Jr who Mr Rappleyea said would be favored both because he is wellknown and because the seat on paper is Republican There is also a new district known as the expressway seat because it snakes along the Long Island Expressway The Democrats would have a chance in the district but are divided internally An incumbent Republican Assemblyman John C Cochrane of Bay Shore faces a primary against Anthony Noto because of an acrimonious feud among Suffolk Republican leaders Mr Rappleyea said the Republicans also have high hopes of defeating Assemblyman George J Hochbrueckner a Coram Democrat who is being opposed by Robert J Gaffney The Republicans have also targeted Assemblyman Paul Harenberg Democrat who is being opposed by Philip M Murphy Republican One of the most interesting races in the state is taking place in Nassau County in a district around Roosevelt Two black women are running for the Democratic nomination Carol A Hall and Barbara A Patton and the Republicans have already designated Briding Newell who is also a black woman The seat was drawn to give a black candidate a good chance of election and the winner will be the first black elected to the Legislature from Nassau Two Republican seats in Nassau were eliminated those of Joseph M Reilly a veteran and Guy R Mazza a newcomer to the Assembly Mr Reilly has taken a 64000 job as County General Services Commissioner Mr Mazza is expected to receive a state or county post Republicans think that the redrawing of the districts of two Democrats Lewis J Yevoli and Angelo F Orazio could make them more vulnerable but the Democrats disagree Mr Skeloss candidacy for the State Senate leaves his seat open and Gregory R Becker a Republican is favored to win it Westchester and Upstate Spirited races are expected for the seats of retiring Westchester incumbents William B Finneran a Democrat and Jon S Fossel a Republican Both are seeking higher office  Mr Finneran the State Comptrollers job and Mr Fossel a seat in Congress Rockland County voters will decide a rematch between Assemblyman Thomas P Morahan a Republican of New City and Robert Conner the Democrat Mr Morahan defeated two years ago In a new Hudson Valley seat a fourway Republican primary has developed that could aid Democrats South and west of Albany an incumbent Democrat Gail S Shaffer faces a potentially difficult challenge from a popular local sheriff Barney Waldron In the new river district encompassing all or parts of Troy Cohoes Renssalaer Albany and other Democratic communities on the Hudson River three Democrats are fighting for a nomination that is likely to mean election Reapportionment forced a Republican Joan B Hague to retire in a district north of Albany Democrats have targeted incumbent Republicans Andrew W Ryan Jr John G A ONeil William E Bush and Thomas A Hanna Republicans believe they have an opportunity to defeat Maurice D Hinchey Jr Richard S Ruggiero and Michael J Bragman And the Republicans also have a chance of picking up the seat of the retiring incumbent Democrat Rolland E Kidder Reapportionment has created a contest between two Buffalo incumbents Carol A Siwek a Republican and William B Hoyt a Democrat And population shifts linked with reapportionment are likely to lead to the election of a new black Assemblyman from Rochester
COLLEGE FEE TO SUPPORT LOBBY GROUP IS TESTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/22/nyregion/college-fee-to-support-lobby-group-is-tested.html,A ruling by a Federal appeals court here has set the stage for a trial on a challenge to Rutgers Universitys policy of charging 250 a semester in mandatory fees to support a lobbying and research group All campuses with mandatory fees for such groups could be affected by the outcome of the trial set up by the decision which was given earlier this month In 1972 Rutgers the New Jersey state university established a policy of collecting mandatory student fees for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group on any of its campuses where the fees were approved by referendums Through the group Rutgers has explained in court papers students participate in intern programs whose purpose it is to enhance their formal education in clinical research projects which give practical experience in areas affecting public policy Prelaw Student Objects Joseph P Galda of Gloucester Township NJ a prelaw student at Rutgerss Camden campus objected on the ground that he did not want to contribute to projects he disagreed with such as the groups activities in behalf of the proposed equal rights amendment and abortion rights for women He obtained the counsel of the MidAtlantic Foundation here The foundation a conservative legal office sued Rutgers on his behalf in 1979 charging that making the fees mandatory was an unconstitutional infringement of free speech and expression On no occasion has the Supreme Court allowed an entity to collect compulsory fees for political or ideological purposes without the knowing consent of the contributor Myrna P Field MidAtlantic president told Judge Stanley S Brotman in Federal District Court in Camden The case however did not go to trial because Judge Brotman ruled last year that students had not been deprived of their rights because those who wished could apply to the lobbying group for a refund Decision Is Reversed Mr Galda appealed On Aug 4 a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed Judge Brotman and sent the case back to him for trial It said that unless a compelling state interest was demonstrated a fee used to finance political activity cannot be exacted even temporarily from those unwilling to pay Edward Lloyd executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group said from his office in Trenton that the groups political action is incidental to its educational value rather than the other way around He said that projects the groups sevenmember staff is now working on with student interns include the dangers of toxic chemicals water pollution and opposition to cuts in the states budget for higher education The student group does not work for political candidates but the Court of Appeals noted that it has lobbied for environmental protection minority rights solar energy and other issues Groups Operate in 25 States Mr Lloyd said similar student organizations are on campuses in 25 states though not all the fees that support them are mandatory He said the outcome of the Rutgers case could have an impact in all states where fees are mandatory the groups preferred method of collecting fees Voluntary fee systems cost more to administer he said On the other hand if the Rutgers system is found to be constitutional it will insure the validity of all funding systems for all PIRGs because the mandatory system is the one that skirts the line most closely on the constitutional question said John C Sims a lawyer representing the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group in a telephone interview from his office in Washington
DOWN IN THE LIBERAL TRENCHES WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/22/weekinreview/down-in-the-liberal-trenches-with-the-judiciary-committee.html,Thank God said Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California that it is so difficult to get legislation and constitutional amendments through Those old founding fathers really made it tough Indeed they did and for years conservatives used Capitol Hills tangle of legislative rules and procedures to block civil rights reforms and other proposals not to their liking Liberals such as Mr Edwards constantly on the defensive since the 1980 election are now using all those rules and procedures against a host of conservative measures And increasingly the liberals chief base of operations  and sometimes its last line of defense  is the House Judiciary Committee headed by Representative Peter W Rodino Jr a Democrat from Newark Mr Rodino became something of a national figure in 1974 when he presided over the committees nationally televised impeachment inquiry Earlier this year his committee produced legislation extending key sections of the Voting Rights Act But for the most part recently he has come to measure his success not in battles won but in losses averted Mr Edwards who heads the panels Civil and Constitutional Law subcommittee says the Judiciary Committee is like the little Dutch boy weve got our finger in the dike With time running out on the 97th Congress the chairman and his liberal colleagues have given a high priority to trying to scuttle a constitutional amendment approved by the Senate earlier this month that would mandate a balanced Federal budget except during wartime Mr Rodino and company may have succeeded Last week the Judiciary subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law approved several changes that would make the House version of an amendment substantially different from the Senate measure and then recessed until next month The subcommittee voted to require the President to submit a balanced budget to modify the number of votes needed to permit deficit spending and to drop a provision that banned tax increases to balance the Federal budget at rates higher than the general rate of growth of the economy Meanwhile supporters of the amendment missed an unofficial deadline for obtaining the signatures they needed on a petition to send the amendment directly to the House floor Senator Orrin Hatch a Republican from Utah and sponsor of the measure in the Senate said he and other backers might ask the President to call a special session of Congress this fall Slow Leak or Deliberate Bottleneck Mr Rodino doesnt care for it to be said that he is bottling up legislation he calls it all part and parcel of conducting a very slow and deliberate process designed to educate the public as well as his fellow lawmakers Nonetheless if the balanced budget amendment should somehow clear the House Mr Rodino would try to ensnarl the measure in a conference with the Senate and hope that time ran out I just cant stand by Mr Rodino said and see the Constitution made a mockery of The roster of controversial legislation languishing in the Judiciary Committee also includes  A bill already passed by the Republicancontrolled Senate that would bar Federal judges from ordering school busing for purposes of integration A Judiciary subcommittee has held hearings but has no intention of doing anything else Advocates are circulating a discharge petition to force a floor vote but they have little prospect for success  A variety of bills and constitutional amendments that would overturn Supreme Court decisions banning school prayer and legalizing abortions both matters the subject of a filibuster mounted in the Senate by moderates and liberals last week  Another Senatepassed bill to reform regulatory procedures This bill has actually cleared the committee but has not been scheduled for floor action  Dozens of proposals to toughen criminal laws and procedures Critics have complained that the committee was holding up action on immigration reforms but a spokesman for Mr Rodino said in view of last weeks passage by the Senate the committee would send the bill to the House floor next month Representative Barber B Conable Jr a New York Republican who is sponsoring the balanced budget amendment complains that Mr Rodino has been engaging in a string of monkeyshines and adds A guy like Pete can become a gamesman after awhile He is so good at it that it becomes a game to control something rather than come to grips with it I think added Representative Robert R McClory of Illinois senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee and another booster of the amendment that Rodino is frustrating the will of the House by denying an opportunity to the members and the American public to have this important issue debated and resolved But Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts a liberal Democrat whos a freshman member of the committee counters that many conservatives who complain in public about the delaying tactics of Judiciary members often plead with them in private to keep controversial legislation buried Many members Mr Frank says believe that the function of the Judiciary Committee is to prevent them from having to make tough decisions Congressmen believe it is useful to have some legislative barriers in place that prevent Capitol Hill from working its will too easily in the words of Representative Conable Even Mr Conable thinks a slowmoving Judiciary Committee is particularly valuable because it deals with issues that are often more popular than thoughtful But this has come to be such an unappetizing assignment that the panel had to almost beg for new members after the last election These are controversial issues notes Mr Rodino and they are not issues that members can bring back to their constituents and say I performed this service for you 
DOCTOR'S ABDUCTION STUNS STEEL TOWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/23/us/doctor-s-abduction-stuns-steel-town.html,In a town that has made news for the most part because of its dependence on the declining steel industry the widely reported kidnaping of the director of a local abortion clinic and his wife has come as something of a shock In this depressed city of 34000 values are conservative people are outspoken but law and order are revered People here are quick to say what is on their minds about things they dont like but most dont go for breaking the law Roland Boykins said as he filled his car tank at a downtown service station While the majority of people dont condone the abortion clinic they tolerate it Mayor Paul Schuler said in discussing the abduction of the centers operator Dr Hector Zevallos 53 years old and his wife Rosalie Jean 45 People were very shocked at his disappearance Everybody was disturbed by it Army of God Takes Blame The couple were released unharmed a short distance from their home Friday morning a week after they were said to have been kidnapped by a radical antiabortion group calling itself the Army of God A letter from the group found by the authorities demanded that President Reagan denounce abortion as a condition of the couples release but it mentioned no cash ransom Neither the Federal Bureau of Investigation nor the couple would give details of the week in captivity The center Dr Zevallos directs the Hope Clinic for Women Ltd has been the object of a dozen protests over the last three years Some of the demonstrations were so disorderly that protesters were arrested Despite the opposition to the clinic the kidnapping of the couple shocked the sensibilities of this town Mayor Schuler and others said Hector has been here 15 to 20 years and is wellliked and respected said the Mayor who is a pharmacistHe has delivered a lot of babies in Granite City Neighbors Also Disturbed Others disturbed by the kidnapping included Norman and Raymonda Ruf who live in a weathered neighborhood about two blocks from the clinic Dr Zevallos is Mrs Rufs gynecologist I have no feeling about abortion one way or the other said Mr Ruf a railroad switchman who has lived at Lee Avenue and 22d Street for 21 years Taking sides on whether you should or shouldnt have abortions is one thing but I dont buy this kidnapping at all Nobody likes that sort of thing around here This is a poor neighborhood and a lot of the people in it use the clinic because of the Federal aid available there he added Town Keeps to Itself Granite City a sleepy town about 20 miles northeast of St Louis keeps to itself But it has been the focus of articles over the last two years detailing the effects of the decline in the economy because of its dependence on steel At the turn of the century Granite City had 13 major industries employing about 16000 people according to Alan Richardson executive director of the TriCities Chamber of Commerce which represents Granite City Madison and Venice and two smaller municipalities Mitchell and Pontoon Beach Today there are three major employers employing about 7000 people when times are good Right now these businesses are operating at about half of capacity Mr Richardson said Granite City Steel the citys largest employer employs about 3800 when it is operating at peak but only about 2000 at present Similarly the American Steel Company which employed 1800 when times were good now employs 610 Unemployment Runs 20 Percent The AO Smith Company which used to produce automobile frames closed about three years ago putting 2000 workers out of work Although unemployment runs about 20 percent here the impact on the city has been cushioned somewhat by the generous unemployment benefits awarded to some workers who collect assistance from both the Government and their former employers But those benefits have begun to run out for some Mr Richardson said Others like Mr Ruf said the result could be seen clearly in neighborhoods such as theirs About 80 percent of the people living around here are unemployed and about 70 percent are on welfare Mr Ruf said of his neighbors on Lee Avenue I guess I am lucky to have a job because welfare has become a way of life around here We seem to have lost our sense of community togetherness and the flair for community improvement he said noting that his rundown neighborhood had once been solidly middle class Optimism Still Alive and Well Mr Rufs neighborhood is an example of the decay in much of citys core around the huge blast furnaces and other steel mills Virtually every approach to the city has a ramshackle appearance many storefronts downtown are empty and the citys population has declined by 4000 between 1970 and 1980 Yet optimism is alive and well here Mayor Schuler said We have gone through the Great Depression and most recently the recession of 197374 Most of those of us over 40 have weathered dips in the economy and will survive this one For his part Mr Richardson points out that the city has several wellmaintained neighborhoods People are misled by what they see because the view is bad no matter which road you take to come into the city he said But this city offers a lot of amenities and has a lot of nice neighborhoods that people unfortunately overlook Other Clinics on Guard The kidnapping has had an impact beyond Granite City Uta Landry executive director of the National Abortion Federation in Washington said that the abduction had stirred a lot of panic among abortion clinics and that they are all wondering who will be next She said her agency had sent telegrams to its 240 members urging them to prepare for an increase in antiabortion activities in the coming months She said personnel at some clinics had discussed the possibility of using guards and guns to protect themselves and that a clinic in Indiana had installed bulletproof glass
REAGAN'S SOCIAL IMPACT; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/25/us/reagan-s-social-impact-news-analysis.html,President Reagan took office promising a fundamental change in domestic social policy and it is now clear that he has achieved much of what he promised The growth of welfare and food stamp rolls has been halted even amid a recession with the highest level of unemployment in 40 years The Medicaid rolls have nearly stabilized Expenditures for the construction of subsidized housing for publicservice employment and for job training have been sharply curtailed Congress finished work last week on a second round of domestic spending cuts sought by Mr Reagan With that it has become easier to discern the effect he has had on social policy Changes enacted by Congress at the request of the President combined with a crackdown on fraud and abuse in social welfare programs have saved the Government billions of dollars Even more important members of Congress say that Mr Reagan has fundamentally altered the framework for debate The question for Congress and lobbyists is no longer how to increase access to Federal benefits but how to trim spending Contrast With Nixon On food stamps as on many other social issues President Reagans policy differs as sharply from that of his Republican predecessors as from that of his Democratic predecessors In a State of the Union Message to Congress in 1973 President Nixon boasted During the past four years Federal outlays for food assistance have increased more than threefold Mr Nixon said proudly that the number of people receiving food stamps or surplus commodities had more than doubled in four years To increase the number of food stamp recipients is no longer an explicit goal of Federal policy In his State of the Union Message in January Mr Reagan expressed dismay that the program had grown by 16000 percent in the last 15 years complaining that waste and fraud were adding to its cost In a somewhat critical assessment of Mr Reagans performance Alan S Blinder a professor of economics at Princeton University said in an interview Monday that the Administration had declared a truce in the war on poverty The Presidents Council of Economic Advisers in its annual report to Congress this year said Income redistribution is not a compelling justification for Federal taxing and spending programs The Federal Government serves the poor better by assuring strong economic growth and reducing inflation than by distributing social welfare benefits the advisers said The Census Bureau reported this summer that the number of people living below the official poverty line had increased by 22 million to a total of 318 million meaning that one person in seven now lives in poverty Many sociologists and demographers say they expect the number to rise further as a result of high unemployment and the budget cuts of the last two years The Census Bureau measures poverty by counting money income which includes welfare payments but excludes the value of noncash benefits such as food stamps Medicaid and subsidized housing The poverty threshold for a family of four last year was an annual income of 9287 Nine million or 10 million Americans appear to be permanently poor or unemployed and in the last year there has been growing concern about this group sometimes described as the underclass Counterrevolution Under Way In a comprehensive review of President Reagans first 18 months John L Palmer and Isabel V Sawhill of the Urban Institute a private nonprofit research group state A counterrevolution is under way after a halfcentury of growing Federal efforts to stabilize the economy insure individuals against misfortune redistribute income and opportunity and respond to other perceived national needs The nucleus of this counterrevolution is a philosophy of more limited government In their book The Reagan Experiment to be published next month the two economists observe that the nation is engaged in a retrenchment and reformation of social policy They see many of the changes as inevitable but they assert that the new policies represent a retreat from egalitarian values The retrenchment has been undertaken with a certain amount of care in an effort to redirect benefits to those who need them most Congress like the Administration prefers to tinker with eligibility criteria and benefit formulas rather than making acrosstheboard reductions President Reagan has revived the old concept of the deserving poor whom he calls the truly needy These are people who literally cannot work because of old age illness or disability The President says he has no objection to financing benefits for them But he is staunchly opposed to cash assistance for people who can work Basic Structure Changed In most social programs the President has prevailed upon Congress to trim spending in dozens of ways that do not alter the programs fundamental design However he did change the basic structure of the main Federalstate welfare program Aid to Families with Dependent Children The Administration sharply reduced or eliminated welfare benefits for the working poor on the theory that the Government should not provide an income supplement to people who work Many of the same people lost Medicaid benefits because in nearly half the states people cannot receive medical assistance unless they are eligible for welfare Citing the treatment of the working poor Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan the New York Democrat who designed President Nixons welfare policy said that Mr Reagans policy embodied an extraordinary change in the purposes of public assistance Since 1967 Mr Moynihan said the Government has tried to create an incentive for the poor and nearpoor to work by supplementing their earnings with welfare payments Despite all the budget cuts made in the last two years Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina said last week that the country still had not come to grips with the single biggest cause of hemorrhaging in the Federal budget namely the entitlement programs such as welfare food stamps Medicaid Medicare and Social Security which pay benefits to people who meet certain eligibility criteria Decision on Essentials In a sense he was correct The budget battles in Congress have defined the political constituencies for Federal benefit programs forcing people to decide what is essential and what is secondary David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget said last year that we cannot fund the Great Society the complex of social programs put together by President Johnson Mr Stockman declared that substantial parts of it will have to be heaved overboard But Congress which gave the President most of what he sought last year was far less cooperative this year Last February Mr Reagan proposed to cut the food stamp program by a total of more than 71 billion in the fiscal years 1983 through 1985 Congress approved cuts totaling 19 billion which is less than onethird of what Mr Reagan sought However Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont noted that the cuts followed major changes in the program last year which saved 23 billion in the fiscal year 1982 and will save 7 billion more in 198385 Food Stamp Beneficiaries The number of beneficiaries has not been reduced as much as President Reagan expected because unemployment has been higher than the Administration had forecast In the first eight months of the current fiscal year the number of food stamp recipients averaged 222 million as against 224 million last year The program is expected to cost 113 billion this year only 100 million less than last year Reductions in the welfare caseload have more nearly approximated earlier estimates Federal officials said that 104 million people were receiving payments in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program this year as against 111 million last year Federal welfare costs are expected to total 76 billion this year which is slightly less than last years total of 79 billion Medicaid rolls grew slightly from 225 million recipients in 1981 to 229 million this year In the same period Medicaid spending is expected to rise to 184 billion from 171 billion School Lunch Program More stringent eligibility criteria have reduced participation in the national school lunch program by 10 percent Most of the 26 million children no longer receiving school lunches come from families with incomes exceeding 185 percent of the official poverty line For a family of four 185 percent of poverty means an income of 17000 a year President Reagans housing budget actually shows negative figures for 1982 and 1983 He seeks not only to curtail new spending but also to cancel prior commitments Cushing N Dolbeare president of the National LowIncome Housing Coalition described the Reagan policy as a total reversal a complete aboutface Instead of gradually expanding lowincome housing assistance he intends to contract it Mrs Dolbeare said Once the units authorized under the Carter Administration are built and occupied there will be no additions to the supply of lowincome housing Administration officials said the construction of subsidized housing had become prohibitively expensive Instead of building additional units of subsidized housing as planned by prior administrations Mr Reagan proposes to issue vouchers so that poor families can rent units in existing structures Despite the policy change the number of households receiving Federal assistance is scheduled to rise from 34 million at the end of last year to 4 million in 1985 mainly because of funds appropriated in the Carter Administration Impact on Blacks Cited Civil rights advocates say that Mr Reagans budget cuts have hurt blacks disproportionately because the 342 percent poverty rate among blacks is more than twice the 14 percent rate for the population as a whole Using the same income data Administration officials say blacks are in disproportionate numbers beneficiaries of the wide array of benefit programs still in existence Some of the most important changes made by Mr Reagan involve explosive questions of politics and social morality rather than dollars and cents Mr Reagan has encouraged those challenging a long series of Federal court decisions on civil rights abortion and school prayer although to date neither he nor Congress has changed the law in these areas The President supports a constitutional amendment to permit officially sanctioned prayer in public schools The Supreme Court forbade such prayer 20 years ago saying it violated First Amendment guarantees of freedom of religion Mr Reagan has also urged Congress to approve antiabortion legislation which would permit states to reimpose restrictions removed by a 1973 decision of the Supreme Court In addition Mr Reagan has fought against school busing and the use of numerical hiring goals even though the Court has approved such remedies for school segregation and employment discrimination
HELMS ON PRAYER AND ABORTION: 'I AM READY TO TAKE MY CHANCES',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/25/opinion/l-helms-on-prayer-and-abortion-i-am-ready-to-take-my-chances-105094.html,To the Editor You spelled my name correctly in your Aug 20 editorial Mr Helms Plays Dodgem But I found scarcely anything else in it to be accurate The Times was playing dodgem with the truth Contrary to your statement the record will show that I have been ready to vote on both the voluntary school prayer amendment and the abortion amendment they are separate amendments now before the Senate in the orderly fashion prescribed by parliamentary procedure If you doubt it inquire of Senate Majority Leader Baker Senators Packwood Weicker et al have resisted letting the Senate vote Thats why Senator Baker filed a cloture petition against their filibuster They appear to be afraid to put their views to the test of a Senate vote You are dead wrong in your assertion that I have reneged on any previous agreement to schedule a time limitation on debate Majority Leader Baker has refuted your assertion on the Senate floor You are incorrect in saying that I wanted to withdraw my statute I have had several proposals available but no specific statute was ever put forward for Senate debate until I sent my amendment to the desk Senators Packwood and Weicker were livid because they were unsuccessful in their efforts to restrict me to an antiabortion proposal which they thought least likely to be approved by the Senate I cannot imagine what prompted you to concoct the fantasy that I have ever announced  or even suggested  that I wanted to withdraw Senator Hatchs amendment in favor of mine I respect Senator Hatchs right to include his proposal in any unanimous consent request You state that my righttolife measure is coupled with a ban on court review of state laws sanctioning prayer in public schools The proposals are in fact separate proposals which in the normal course of Senate procedure would be voted on separately they are coupled only by the Senate rules which state the order of voting Incidentally the voluntary school prayer measure is the identical measure that has already passed the Senate twice As to the findings which you treat with such incredulity they are based upon the most extensive hearings on the subject ever conducted by a legislative body in which all points of view were thoroughly aired by legal and scientific experts and which are now available in 1038 printed pages of testimony Thus there need be no surprise at what the findings are You do me too much credit when you say I managed to break a filibuster by Senator Packwood In fact Senator Packwood lost the floor under the rules when he sought to make a motion to restrict my rights after telling me informally that he would make no such motion You say that my tabling motion was voted down by colleagues thoroughly miffed by my flouting accepted procedure The Times evidently is more skilled at mental telepathy than I but I have not flouted any accepted procedure to my knowledge  and indeed Senator Baker has stated so on the Senate floor If there is gridlock it is someone else who is jamming the system I am ready to vote at any time I have been ready to vote on the basis of any time agreement and I have repeatedly stated so on the record I admit that the voting may be close but I am ready to take my chances Why isnt the other side Better luck next time JESSE HELMS US Senator from North Carolina Washington Aug 20 1982

NEW ABORTION RULE CHALLENGED IN COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/26/garden/new-abortion-rule-challenged-in-court.html,Planned Parenthood filed a Federal court challenge Monday to a new Indiana law requiring that parents of underage girls requesting abortions be notified at least 24 hours before the procedure The suit seeks a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the law when it becomes effective Sept 1 It was referred to Judge James Cale Holder of the United States Court for the Southern District of Indiana It argues that the parentalnotification requirement will severely restrict minors access to safe legal abortions in Indiana since approximately 45 percent of the teenagers under 18 who receive abortions have elected for significant reason not to notify their parents The notification law passed by the 1982 Legislature requires doctors to inform the parents of girls 17 and younger 24 hours before an abortion takes place To be exempted from the rule a girl must petition the juvenile court in her county for a waiver of the requirement The plaintiffs in the classaction suit are Indiana Planned Parenthood Affiliates Inc Planned Parenthood Associates of Northwest Indiana and its medical director Dr Clarence Boone and Dr Ralph Streeter medical director of the Indianapolis Womens Center We are concerned that if a young person feels it is impossible to talk to her parents then she will resort to an illegal abortion or go out of state said Ann McFarren executive director of Planned Parenthood Associates of Northwest Indiana The law also is unclear in terms of what types of notification and identification are to be used she said It does not prescribe any appeal procedure The suit asks that the law be declared unconstitutional because it unduly burdens the right of minors to freely make and effectuate a decision to terminate pregnancy  a fundamental right of privacy The suit also contends that the 24hour waiting period will unnecessarily delay abortions and compel minors to undergo secondtrimester abortions which are performed at increased cost and with increased health risks If Judge Holder does not bar enforcement of the law Mrs McFarren said Planned Parenthoods Merrillville clinic will comply with it The Merrillville clinic is the only Planned Parenthood affiliate in Indiana that performs abortions In 1980 doctors there performed abortions for 362 women under 18 who comprised about 15 percent of the clinics abortion patients

pp New York William Morrow  Co 1545 BOTH of these summer diversions are compulsively readable and each one could have shed a hundred pages to the benefit of forest preservation and the reading public Here the similarities abruptly end Michael M Thomas  whose previous book was Green Monday a stylish financial thriller  stalks dangerous human fauna in two treacherous milieus art hustling and business manipulation as it is practiced at the multibilliondollar level Once an assistant curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a financial consultant Mr Thomas knows both these environments intimately enough to detest most of the characters he has drawn one suspects from living models The suitably intricate plot revolves around a pair of scams one apiece in the linked worlds of big money and bigleague art collection Buford Gudge IV  Bubber as the world calls him behind his back  is an enormously wealthy Texas magnate whose enterprises include cattle oil gas minerals and much else His young wife Caryn socially ambitious and sexually promiscuous seeks to scale the social heights by acquiring the magnificent collection of Italian masterpieces lovingly amassed by two elderly collectors long ensconced in a retreat in the environs of Florence modeled after Bernard Berensons I Tatti For his part her besotted husband who is dying of cancer will do anything kidnapping included to gratify his wifes ambitions It is the only way to get her back to the ranch where Bubber prefers to end his days Why fret about 400 million after all if it suffices to rent the sexual services of the woman one loves Bubber has a project of his own With the help of his Japanese assistant who is a computer whiz and legal expert he concocts an intricate scheme that features the invention of two major corporations the entrapment of a New York investment banking firm and dubious dealings in government securities The point of the exercise is the financial destruction of his hated half sister Granada Masterman the only surviving mortal to separate Bubber involuntarily from a piece of his property Besides he seethes with venom against the effete East and the unmerited privileges of its ruling establishment Suffice it to say that Bubbers revenge sparks a financial panic larger in scale and impact than the reallife silver misadventures of the Hunt brothers In Mr Thomass telling it couldnt have happened to nicer people Oh yes Caryn Gudge does get her collection A clever double twist however rather mars her achievement Mr Thomas apparently despises his moneygrubbers and collectors who are devoid of taste and buy masterpieces as investments or keys to the fashionable drawing rooms of New York London and Paris But perhaps just for variety there are at least five sympathetic characters who are contrasted to the villains Nick Revelle an art dealer of high ideals imagine and his lover Jill the two Florence art collectors and an implausible tycoon Harvey Bogle equipped with genuine taste for fine paintings Mr Thomas has a good deal to tell us most of it interesting about art history and financial chicanery His prose however is uneven Quite frequently sentences paragraphs and entire pages sag under the weight of the flood of detail Nevertheless in some of his disquisitions upon the qualities of such artists as Giotto and Rubens and in his sensitive evocation of Italian landscape Mr Thomas writes with literary distinction Even if you happen to be rich and fashionable you will probably enjoy this novel unless money art power and sex bore you   Why review Master of the Game Its fortunate publishers have printed a first edition of 200000 copies budgeted 150000 for advertising and arranged a national publicity tour for the perpetrator A dual main selection of the Literary Guild Master of the Game is a product with a large market more fittingly evaluated by The Wall Street Journal or Consumer Reports But dont get me wrong Although this may be literary junk food it is hard to put down once you get started Sidney Sheldons model is not Henry James Within the first 100 pages Jamie McGregor a young Scot eager to make his fortune in South Africas diamond fields circa 1883 is cheated of his first lucky strike by an unscrupulous partner beaten nearly to death when he seeks redress gnawed by vultures and mangled by a ferocious Alsatian These trivial misadventures turn his hair prematurely white but fail to prevent him from looting enough diamonds from a closely guarded beach to set himself up in life and found a business dynasty  That dynasty is later dominated by his granddaughter Kate Blackwell The novel begins with a prologue in which 90yearold Kate is celebrating her birthday after the guests leave she begins to muse about the ghosts of her past and Mr Sheldon whisks us back a century or so to the time of Jamies adventures From there we follow the course of the Blackwell dynasty under Kates tutelage Kate is a darling She selects as her husband her grandfathers trusted assistant and decrees that their son Tony should be the appointed heir to the multinational fortunes of her empire There is a small barrier to the execution of her design Tony is bored by money and wants only to be an artist Worse still he displays considerable talent and threatens to become a major painter Kate who invariably knows best has Pariss leading art critic write a destructive review of her heirs first show set up naturally by mother Crushed Tony yields to his imperious parents bidding Kate arranges for Tony to marry the daughter of the owner of an enterprise she has decided to purchase the young bride dies in childbirth When Tony learns that his mother had encouraged her to avoid an abortion even though her doctor had warned her that pregnancy was likely to endanger her life he goes mad and has to be carted off to an expensive sanitarium where his everloving mother arranges for a lobotomy that turns him into a vegetable Oh yes Tonys wife did produce two adorable infants the twins Eve and Alexandra Eve who figures hugely in the latter half of the novel as Kates possible successor exhibits one regrettable trait From the age of 5 on she earnestly endeavors  unsuccessfully you will be glad to hear  to murder her sister The child is just a touch jealous Sheldons generosity in providing violence should not imply that he neglects sex If your reading taste runs to rape sodomy homosexuality and numerous other fleshly diversions be reassured Mr Sheldon has something for you On mature reflection the first printing may be too small for Mr Sheldons smooth serviceable if unmemorable prose carries one along much like the movie serials of the Great Depression Any writer who can get his audience to ask

MEDICAL GROUPS OPPOSING CURBS IN ABORTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/31/us/medical-groups-opposing-curbs-in-abortion-law.html,Four major organizations of physicians and nurses joined the latest Supreme Court debate over abortion today urging the Justices to declare unconstitutional an Akron Ohio city ordinance that limits the ways in which doctors may counsel and treat women seeking abortions The Justice Department last month filed a brief in support of Akron whose fouryearold ordinance is viewed by Excerpts from Akron law page A12 antiabortion groups as a model for local legislation around the nation The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the constitutionality of the ordinance and will hear arguments in the winter The Akron ordinance requires that abortions be performed only in hospitals after the first three months of pregnancy forbids girls under the age of 15 to have an abortion without the consent of a parent or a judge and requires doctors to read their patients a statement on the procedures alleged dangers and consequences AMA Joins in Brief The four medical organizations filing a joint brief with the Court today were the 235000member American Medical Association the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which represents 90 percent of the specialists in those fields the Nurses Association of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics The groups brief said that the Akron ordinance presented a serious obstacle to sound medical practice because it required a docto provide a pregnant woman with inaccurate baseless or irrelevant information that might intimidate and deter her from effectuating her decision to terminate her pregnancy At a news conference here Dr James L Breen presidentelect of the obstetricians and gynecologists association identified three provisions of the Akron ordinance as particularly repugnant The first is an informed consent provision which imposes criminal penalties on a doctor who does not recite a sevenparagraph statement to a patient seeking an abortion The doctor must tell the woman that an abortion is a major surgical procedure that may cause severe emotional disturbances serious medical problems and pain to the unborn child The organizations told the Court that most physicians believed the required information was demonstrably false Abortion is a remarkably safe surgical procedure the brief said with the risk of death about the same as that from an injection of penicillin for the treatment of gonorrhea The risk of death from childbirth is about 10 times as high as the risk of death from a legal abortion We all believe in informed consent Dr Breen said in an interview but its not the art of medicine to scare people to death Objects to Mental Anguish I would refuse to practice medicine if I had to subject my patients to that kind of mental anguish added Dr Breen who is chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at St Barnabus Medical Center in Livingston NJ The second Akron provision that the organizations urged the Court to strike down is a requirement that abortions after the first three months of pregnancy be performed in hospitals The brief said that abortions performed in properly equipped clinics were as safe as those performed in hospitals until at least the 16th week of pregnancy as well as less expensive and more convenient for the patient The hospitalization requirement the brief said both locks physicians into outmoded standards of care and interferes significantly with a womans ability to exercise her constitutional right to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy The third provision to which the medical groups objected makes it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on a girl under the age of 15 without the written consent of a parent or a court order Dr Breen said that when doctors were confronted by a young girls request for an abortion we beg plead and cajole to bring the parent into the process But he said that not infrequently the child had been abused at home or had become pregnant as the result of incest When a child is asking for help Dr Breen said we cant tell her to go back to where they beat you up and get permission Supports Right to Abortion Dr Breen who is a Roman Catholic said that he did not perform abortions for reasons of philosophy morality and religion However he said I concur totally in the right of women who want abortions to obtain them and he refers such patients to colleagues If my 16yearold daughter told me she was pregnant he said shed have an abortion by 4 oclock that afternoon I couldnt take a child and ruin whatever future she has because of an accident of nature The Akron case before the Supreme Court is an appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which struck down the consent provisions for both adults and minors and upheld the requirement for hospitalization in secondtrimester abortions

G.O.P. COALITION OF '80 THREATENS TO UNRAVEL IN CONGRESS ELECTIONS; Campaign Outlook; First of a series of articles on the 1982 Congressional campaign.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/01/us/gop-coalition-80-threatens-unravel-congress-elections-campaign-outlook-first.html,Authorities in both major parties forecast difficulty for the Republican Party in this falls election in holding together the coalition of voters including many traditional Democrats that won the Presidency for Ronald Reagan in 1980 Although most campaigns for the Senate and House have yet to take shape doubts have been voiced that the Republicans can retain the kind of broad support that coalesced two years ago behind Mr Reagan and other party conservatives Many of the bluecollar workers who left the Democratic Party and voted Republican for the first time have indicated that at least for this year they intend to vote for Democratic candidates according to public opinion polls taken for both parties And that sector of the new right that is primarily interested in social and family issues which gave overwhelming support to Mr Reagan has served notice that it is unhappy with much of the Reagan record and is unaligned with any party for 1982 These people are chiefly fundamentalist Protestants Over all much depends on whether the elections turn out to be largely a referendum on the Presidents performance as the 1974 offyear elections were on the Watergate issue or mostly a collection of local races as was the case four years ago when President Carters performance was not a major issue But assuming that the Reagan record will have an effect on the outcome as both sides do assume there is disagreement whether Mr Reagans 1980 coalition can be reactivated Peter D Hart a polltaker for Democratic candidates said of the bluecollar voters who swung to Mr Reagan in 1980 That is already gone As for other groups he said There is not going to be a return to the New Deal but there is going to be a reunion in 1982 for the Democrats Ann F Lewis political director for the Democratic National Committee was enthusiastic She said the Reagan coalition of 1980 was breaking up and further that there was a general erosion toward Democratic candidates Republicans do not see it that way Richard Wirthlin Mr Reagans polltaker acknowledged that there had been slippage of bluecollar support because of high unemployment but he said that other elements of the coalition including farmers independents and soft Democrats seemed to be holding together And Robert M Teeter a polltaker for Republican candidates gave a similar assessment Yet the fragility of the coalition can be seen in the forces that brought it together A New York TimesCBS News Poll on Election Day 1980 covering a sample of the 432 million Americans who voted for Mr Reagan showed that a large share of them were motivated more by dissatisfaction with President Carter than by any serious ideological commitment About 38 percent of the 12782 voters interviewed nationwide that day said they had cast their ballots for Mr Reagan because they felt it was time for a change This was cited almost twice as often as any other reason Voters in that category tended to have made their choice late in the campaign indicating a lack of firm commitment Nevertheless the Reagan vote was impressive in the numbers of those from the old Democratic coalition that defected from Mr Carter after almost 50 years of Democratic allegiance Bluecollar workers who in the past overwhelmingly favored Democratic candidates supported Mr Reagan by a small margin Bornagain white Protestants whose voting record had not been documented but who gave strong support to Mr Carter in 1976 voted almost 2 to 1 for Mr Reagan Catholic Shift to Reagan Roman Catholics who along with Jews constituted another traditional stronghold for the Democrats voted 51 to 40 percent for Mr Reagan Jews stayed with the Democrats 45 to 39 percent for Mr Carter but this was a much smaller margin than in the past At stake in November will be 435 seats in the House and 33 seats in the Senate The Democrats now hold the majority of seats in the House 242 to 192 with one vacancy resulting from the resignation of Fred Richmond Democrat of Brooklyn The Republicans hold the majority in the Senate 54 to 45 The other seat is held by Senator Harry F Byrd Jr of Virginia an independent who usually votes with the Democrats on organizational matters Some authorities on American politics doubt that it is possible for any party to build longstanding coalitions of the kind that served the Democrats so well The major parties are no longer able to set a national agenda because of a proliferation of special interests that operate outside party structures and exert pressures on behalf of their own goals through financial contributions and lobbying In recent years the national Republican Party has strengthened its hand in elections by raising its own funds for candidates and improving the quality of its contestants But the problem of longterm allegiances remains The most obvious case in point is that sector of the new right that opposes abortions homosexual rights a constitutional equal rights amendment for women the Supreme Courts prohibition of mandatory prayer in the public schools and other issues relating to the family and to community standards In 1980 Moral Majority Inc headed by the Rev Jerry Falwell the television evangelist and other groups persuaded the Reagan forces to write most of the social issue goals into the Republican platform and warmly embraced Mr Reagan who campaigned for those goals Mr Falwell said that those issues and a voter registration drive in churches had activated three million people to vote who previously had little or nothing to do with politics In his first year in office Mr Reagan emphasized his economic goals and did not push the social concerns of the new right in Congress This year the Administration has devoted more effort to those concerns the antibusing and antiabortion moves for example Reagan Record Termed Weak But Cal Thomas vice president for communications of Moral Majority characterized Mr Reagans record to date as weak on the social issues He said in a telephone interview that some White House officials were mistakenly counting the new right in the Republican column for this years elections He said Moral Majority was beginning a registration drive intended to add another million voters to the base built in 1980 But that he said does not mean they will necessarily vote for conservatives aligned with Mr Reagan They might stay at home and not vote he said He said that many had taken that position before their political activation in recent years Uncertainty About Support V Lance Tarrance of Houston a political consultant and polltaker for Republican candidates many of them in regions where the socalled religious right is entrenched confirmed that their direction was difficult to predict Most are floating voters in and out every four years or so he said Some Republicans contend that Mr Reagan has held onto the Roman Catholic support he gained in 1980 in part because of his legislation to grant tax credits for parents with children in private schools But Democrats counter that that may be threatened by a split that has developed between urban Catholics and sponsors of private academies in nonurban areas that are mostly white The split is over whether guarantees of racial integration which many urban Catholics favor should be written into the legislation now before Congress Most authorities say Mr Reagan cannot count on the defections by Jews from the Democratic Party that helped him in 1980 Jewish leaders have been at odds with the Administration on foreign and domestic policies they say that Jews usually pick and choose among candidates on a range of issues and seldom vote as a block One thing that is worrying Republicans is their seeming inability to make inroads into the black vote In 1980 blacks voted almost 8 to 1 for Mr Carter Republican officials acknowledge there are signs that blacks may vote in a bloc again this year against Reagan policies with a stronger turnout than two years ago They say that this could offset part of whatever coalition the Republicans may have Over all authorities on both sides say the Republicans will probably do better because of their superior organization and financing if the elections are more locally focused and are not a referendum on the Reagan performance But the Democrats are pushing to make them just that Tomorrow The economic issue

4 GUBERNATORIAL HOPEFULS JOIN IN DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/02/nyregion/4-gubernatorial-hopefuls-join-in-debate.html,The four major candidates for Governor sat side by side today and occasionally crossed party lines as they differed on prisons abortion Indian claims and the death penalty The differences came up in a 90minute combined debate audience participation and callin program One issue that did not cross party lines was abortion The two Republicans Lewis E Lehrman and Paul J Curran said that abortion was wrong and that they opposed it They also opposed Medicaid financing of abortions The two Democrats Mayor Koch and Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo said they supported liberalized abortion laws and Medicaid financing of abortions Split on Death Penalty On the death penalty the candidates split 3 to 1 with only Mr Cuomo against it The division touched off an exchange between Mr Koch and Mr Cuomo after the Mayor said that he was sure there will be a miscarriage of justice in which an innocent person was executed But the Mayor added Think of the other side  the thousands of people who might be killed without that deterrent Mr Cuomo charged that Mr Koch was willing to blow a life away He added When you kill this person innocently and his wife and children come before you and ask why youre going to tell them maybe it will save somebody else That was the sharpest exchange in the session which was marked more by some sniping and humorous thrusts than vituperation The four candidates sat side by side on the television stage at a suburban Rochester station Disagree on More Prisons Even if he loses the Republican nomination to Mr Curran Mr Lehrman is assured of appearing on the ballot Sept 23 as the Conservative Party candidate And Mr Cuomo if he loses the Democratic primary to Mr Koch is also guaranteed a line on the ballot as the Liberal Party candidate Mr Koch and Mr Lehrman considered the frontrunners in the Democratic and Republican races clashed several times He looks at it like a politician I look at it as a taxpayer said Mr Lehrman of Mr Koch in a discussion of more state prison space Mr Koch said Mr Lehrman has no conception of what hes talking about on this issue Mr Lehrman proposed double bunking prefabricated prisons and conversion of mental hospitals to prisons that would cost less than the 100000 per cell of new maximumsecurity prisons Mr Koch said he would favor double bunking only as a last alternative to an early release of prisoners Mr Curran and Mr Cuomo said that the state was negotiating for the possible transfer of Federal facilities to the state for use as prisons and was also converting some mental hospitals But Mr Cuomo went further and criticized the doublebunking program as easy for politicians to sound macho He said that the double bunking would require additional dining and recreational space and was opposed by corrections officials as potentially dangerous to prison guards The candidates also differed on Indian claims to land in central New York a critical issue in some areas of the state Mr Lehrman said I dont believe the Indians have a fair claim The three other candidates said that was a matter for the courts and Congress The candidates also disagreed on initiative referendum and recall proposals which would permit voters to place issues on the ballot by petition and even the recall of public officials between elections Mr Lehrman said he favored all three proposals Mr Curran had doubts about recall while the two Democrats generally opposed the proposals entirely At a news conference here later Mr Koch said he was withholding judgment on a proposal by Adam Walinsky an aide to Mr Lehrman to provide scholarships to college students in return for three years service on a police force But then Mr Koch went on to brand the proposal as a ridiculous idea and dumb At a meeting with about 50 Jewish community leaders the Mayor said he favored even minimum jail sentences for drunken drivers  Liberal Party Suing Koch The Liberal Party sued Mayor Koch for 11 million in Federal court Wednesday on the ground he was threatening the firing of public employees or civil servants for reasons of their political affiliation Leaders of the party which supports Mr Cuomo for Governor cited an article in The New York Times July 21 that quoted mayoral aides as saying they were compiling lists of Liberals on the city and state payrolls for future purges At a news conference in party headquarters 165 West 46th Street the Liberal leader Raymond B Harding called Mr Koch a bully adding He likes to pick on those who cant fight back But his attack on our members constitutes a brazen return of bossism to New York In a statement Mr Koch called the suit frivolous adding that he never hired or fired a person based on his political affiliation
G.O.P. TO FOCUS CAMPAIGN ON 'GIVE HIM A CHANCE'; Campaign Outlook; Third of a series of articles on the 1982 Congressional campaign.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/03/us/gop-focus-campaign-give-him-chance-campaign-outlook-third-series-articles-1982.html,By now the grandfatherly mail carrier in a Republican National Committee commercial is a familiar figure to millions of television viewers For gosh sakes he says as if counseling a group of impatient children lets give the guy a chance The guy of course is President Reagan Democratic spokesmen have stewed for weeks about the political advertisement depicting the postman delivering Social Security checks with a costofliving raise and crediting Mr Reagan for it The Reagan Administration had actually sought to reduce the increase the Democrats say Whatever the merits of this criticism White House political advisers say they have decided to use the mail carriers plea for patience as the unifying theme in the campaign activities of the President the Republican National Committee and the partys campaign committees in the Senate and House In a new series of television commercials now being released the patience theme will be broadened into an argument that because the Presidents economic program needs more time to work he deserves additional Republican support in Congress to keep the Democrats from rolling back his economic reforms Its a pretty simple theme said Robert M Teeter a polltaker who serves on the campaign strategy group assembled by the White House chief of staff James A Baker 3d Mr Teeter described this theme as saying to the voters Weve made some big changes The question is do we want to stay the course and see them through or go back to the policies of the past Of the overall design of the campaign Mr Teeter added The real function of the President is to set that theme in the public mind Mr Reagans advisers acknowledge both a glaring irony and a glaring weakness in Mr Reagans adoption of the patience theme The irony is that it was first used 48 years ago by the Democrats The weakness is that it is essentially defensive involving an admission that the economic recovery promised in the 1980 campaign has not come To offset that Reagan aides are trying to devise some dramatic and surprising moves for the President to make late in the campaign So far the exact nature of those moves is a closely guarded secret in Mr Bakers strategy group If the game is tied and there are two minutes to go you dont want to tell the other team what play youre going to run said a participant in a recent meeting held at Blair House to discuss October surprises that Mr Reagan might spring Interviews with White House and Republican party officials and their advisers provided an overview of the campaign Between Labor Day and the election on Nov 2 White House schedulers have penciled in 14 days of travel and campaigning for the President But that schedule could be cut sharply depending on the economy and the outcome of a debate between Reagan aides who want the President to stump the nation for Republican candidates and those who want him to remain on the sidelines as much as possible The debate will continue until late October when the schedule is locked in a Republican strategist said Stunned by angry Republican reaction to Mr Bakers prediction that the party would lose 38 seats the White House has revised its worst case estimate to 20 seats If theres a major downward trend in the economy then you could add 5 to 10 to that worst number a White House official said Senate Is Top Priority The top White House priority is holding the Republican majority in the Senate and most of Mr Reagans campaign activity will be centered on Senate races The Republicans officially predict a gain of three or four seats However party professionals see jeopardy for two Republicans from the heart of Reagan country Senator Harrison H Schmitt of New Mexico and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah a state where a Democratic victory would be interpreted as a major crack in the Presidents foundation of Western support Thanks in part to Mr Reagans abilities as a fund raiser Republican National Committee strategists believe they can outspend the Democrats 3 to 1 Greater financial and technical resources will enable the White House to carry out projects such as its plan to march every Republican Congressional incumbent through the White House for videotaping sessions in which each will be depicted as a personal adviser to the President On a 30second commercial if youve got the guy briefing the President for 18 seconds it looks like he lives over here a White House aide said Upset by polls showing erosion in Mr Reagans bluecollar support strategists have decided he must not campaign by flying from one blacktie dinner to the next according to a party official Ronald Reagan is boots and saddles Ronald Reagan is kielbasa and beer he said explaining that the Presidents advisers want to duplicate the ranches backyard barbecues and ethnic festivals that they used in 1980 to depict Mr Reagan as a vigorous man with the common touch Paradox on His Participation Despite the political advantages that accrue to the occupant of the White House Reagan aides have confronted a central paradox as they plan the Presidents participation in an election in which he is not a candidate He can participate directly in only a fraction of the races created by the opening of 33 Senate seats 435 House seats and 36 governorships this fall Even his participation is no guarantee of success as President Nixon learned in Florida and Texas in 1970 Yet in the press and to a lesser extent in the public mind a Presidents political prestige is linked to the performance of his party at midterm This paradox is the basis of the disagreement on how energetically this President should campaign There is no such thing as a Rose Garden strategy a senior White House official said Theres an element of referendum thats inevitable in this election because the economic recovery program has been the centerpiece This official says the President should campaign at a fairly active level The opposing argument is the President should not campaign so much that he invests his prestige in the outcome Some Want to Minimize Risk I think there is still a battle going on with these two points of view being expressed by powerful individuals in that crazy power structure that is the White House a Republican Party official said Theres just a natural tendency on the part of some to protect the President and anytime you put him into a campaign you put him in a position of damage to his personal standing and there are some who want to minimize that risk The more aggressive view he added is that the election is going to be a referendum on Ronald Reagan whether we want it to be or not and if we dont get involved were going to be in the soup That view is gaining in the White House Opinion surveys and precedent have helped tilt the political debate toward those favoring an active role for Mr Reagan Surveys by Mr Teeter and Richard Wirthlin who was the Presidents campaign polltaker showed that after Memorial Day the Presidents popularity rebounded from the dip in February when he abandoned his quest for a balanced budget and came out in favor of record deficits But the polls also reported that the public was focusing its attention on economics specifically Reagan economics as the top issue Two important findings were related to that One was that Mr Reagans image as a strong leader was a major incentive for voters to choose Republicans in Congressional elections The other finding was that the preservation of Mr Reagans leadership image hinged on whether voters would lose patience at being told every few months that economic recovery was just around the corner They Kept Calendar Open These factors the primacy of the economic issue Mr Reagans personal embodiment of that issue and the need to urge the public to remain patient all pushed Mr Reagans advisers toward keeping his calendar in late September and October open At the White House Nancy Sinnott executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee said they realized that the President is this election that the 1982 election is historic that people will be voting whether to continue the trend of 1980 Really we havent seen a year like it since 1934 with a single issue that dominates the consciousness of the people In fact the example of the 1934 election was a powerful influence on the Baker strategy group Mr Teeter Mr Wirthlin Stuart Spencer a Los Angeles consultant with longstanding ties to Mr Reagan Rich Bond the executive director of the Republican National Commitee Ed Rollins the White House political director and Lee Atwater Mr Rollinss deputy and an advocate of what is variously called populist street corner or bluecollar conservatism Parallels to 1934 Vote The 1934 election which came two years into Franklin D Roosevelts first term was the second since the Civil War where the party in power gained seats said one member of the strategy group President Roosevelt led the Democrats to a nineseat gain in the House by asserting that his New Deal reforms needed more time to work and that his party needed more strength in Congress to prevent the opposition from dismantling those reforms Mr Atwater Mr Bond and Representative Carroll A Campbell Jr of South Carolina are credited with adapting the old Roosevelt patience theme to Mr Reagans uses They devised the lets give the guy a chance line The success of this commercial plus the decision of White House aides to allow what one Republican professional called a fairly significant amount of Presidential campaigning buoyed Republican spirits somewhat Yet many Republicans are worried about the political fallout from the Presidents 983 billion tax increase and they privately question whether the White House political team is up to the test it faces Both concerns point up the importance of this election not only for Mr Reagan but for his chief of staff Mr Baker Mr Baker must face some nagging minor problems such as the bad blood between important Congressional Republicans and the Reagan leadership of the national committee And he must deal with some big problems such as conservative distrust of Mr Bakers political judgment and the fragmentation of the Reagan constituency that is supposed to respond to the mail carriers plea Phillips Says Its Coming Undone Kevin Phillips the conservative author who wrote an influential analysis of the Reagan coalition says that the coalition is weak and coming undone He cites factors such as alienation of bluecollar workers by the Reagan White Houses upper bracket image the Presidents failure to satisfy antiabortionists and other new right activists and Mr Reagans general drift toward traditional Wall Street Republcanism Hardline conservatives blame Mr Baker the White House chief of staff for this trend and they cite the tax bill as an example of bad electionyear politics he has prescribed for the President Mr Baker counters that that political damage from the tax bill will fade away by election time To help assure that a senior Reagan aide said the President will probably sign the tax bill without public ceremony after he returns to Washington from his vacation near here On his way to Washington he will pause to campaign for Senator Hatch in Utah Mr Reagans visit to a Mormon Church cannery and his appearace at an old fashioned GOP picnic in Hooper Utah are the first in a series of activities designed to assure grassroots supporters that Mr Reagan has not abandoned the positions of his 1980 campaign In the fall the Presidents advisers plan for him to renew his ties to his social issue constituencies on abortion busing and crime Mr Reagans advisers regard the peace issue and the related matter of nuclear arms as important secondary concerns that could if ignited by controversy work against Mr Reagan and Republican candidates Mr Reagans announcement of a new peace initiative for the Middle East represents an effort to stay ahead on the peace issue just as he countered antinuclear activists last year by proposing arms negotiations The Congressional elections will provide Republicans a chance to pass judgment on the twopoint theory being advanced by the White House political office The theory largely Mr Atwaters creation holds that midterm Congressional candidates are deprived of two bonus points they would gain by appearing on the ballot with a winning Presidential candidate But those bonus points can be regained in the last days of the campaign according to this theory by lastminute appearances by the President or strong influxes of Republican campaign money 50 Races Will Be Monitored The White House plans to monitor 50 races to see where its money and the President might make a difference In addition Republican senatorial candidates are being asked to think of unique environments for Presidential appearances rodeos they are told are better than blacktie dinners That assumes of course that an appearance by the President would be an asset for a local candidate White House strategists admit when pressed that a strong decline in the economy could lower the demand for Presidential appearances and the White Houses willingness to make them At the moment the general plan is to avoid states where Mr Reagan is low in the polls or where high unemployment creates a strong potential for protest Utah Kansas West Virginia Virginia and Ohio are among the states under consideration for Presidential visits this fall Strategists also want to pick states small enough for the President to have an impact You can put the President into Wyoming and move the whole state three points an aide said whereas a visit to New York would probably not show up on polls at all In regard to poll figures the Reagan strategists face a problem for which there exists no reliable guidance They have a President whose personal approval rating is is in the high 60s or low 70s But there is no body of knowledge in the polling profession about how to convert Presidential popularity into votes for Congressional candidates For the present Mr Reagans advisers are content to rely on a Rooseveltstyle plea for patience and hope that the economy will break in their favor Tomorrow The Democratic strategy
'RIDGEMONT HIGH',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/03/movies/ridgemont-high.html,CAN there be anything about life in high school particularly life in a suburban California high school that the moviegoing public hasnt already seen Well maybe there can A little bit of it turns up in Fast Times at Ridgemont High a jumbled but appealing teenage comedy with something of a fresh perspective on the subject Fast Times at Ridgemont High opens today at the Gemini and other theaters Cameron Crowe who wrote the screenplay and the book on which its based spent a year masquerading as a high school student making some very funny believable notes on how his new friends really felt and sounded Mr Crowe chose to leave himself out of the resultant book which didnt hurt it at all questions about how he could know what had been said in a place like the girls bathroom were rendered beside the point by the witty tone of his stories and by the ways in which they rang true Amy Heckerlings film has no chief character either and in this case its more of a problem The movie didnt necessarily need a reporter in it but it needed a more distinct center than it has Fast Times at Ridgemont High begins not at high school but at a shopping mall Thats where most of the kids spend their time and an amazing number of them seem to work in fastfood restaurants There is Brad Judge Reinhold who declares I shall serve no fries before their time Theres Brads sister Stacy Jennifer Jason Leigh who complains petulantly to her friend and cowaitress Linda Phoebe Cates Youre the one who told me I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall Theres Mark Brian Backer who pines for Stacy from afar or at least from the movie theater across the way where he works as an usher And theres Marks friend Mike Damone Robert Romanus who gives Mark lots of free advice about how to handle women To demonstrate some of this Mr Damone stops at the malls record store and tries out some of his best lines on a lifesize cardboard cutout of Debbie Harry He particularly stresses the aphrodisiac qualities of Led Zeppelin IV All these young actors are relaxed funny and natural But the movies real scene stealer is Sean Penn as a pinkeyed surfer named Jeff Spicoli who wouldnt dream of holding down a job Spicolis dream is to describe surfing to a television interviewer as a way of looking at that wave and saying Hey Bud lets party  Spicoli thinks nothing of ordering a pizza delivered to his history classroom though his teacher Mr Hand doesnt take it that easily Mr Hand Ray Walston is so bothered by Spicolis truancy that he sends other students out to catch him in the hallways Youre wrong yells Spicoli confusedly after hes been lured into the classroom on one such occasion Theres no birthday party for me in here When the movie captures the awful sound of a high school band imitating the Eagles at a prom or the spectacle of two fastfood workers discussing their companies secret sauces one is ketchup plus mayonnaise the other is Russian dressing its onto something that is both amusing and real And Miss Heckerling sounds this note often enough to make her film both worthwhile and disappointing simultaneously Theres a lot to make her film likable but not much to hold it together Mr Crowes book notwithstanding its amiably light tone has a certain amount of grit it has its share of deaths drug problems and other bleak moments including one young girls vividly recalled abortion Miss Heckerlings film before being cut down to its present Rrated form reportedly contained that abortion scene and some explicit sexual episodes Her film can do just as well without them since most of it is too fluffy and insubstantial to accommodate anything raw Theres evidence here that she was after something other than a cheerful casually diverting movie but she hasnt achieved much more Fast Times at Ridgemont High is quite messily assembled in some places and there are moments when the directors comic timing is conspicuously off The music which ought to be one of the movies bigger selling points is for the most part thrown away Don Henley Jackson Browne Stevie Nicks the GoGos and various others contribute songs that seem to drift in and out of the movie distractingly instead of helping to propel it along Shopping Mall Blues FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH directed by Amy Heckerling screenplay by Cameron Crowe based on his book director of photography Matthew R Leonetti edited by Eric Jenkins music by various composers produced by Art Linson and Irving Azoff released by Universal Pictures At the

IDEAS & TRENDS IN SUMMARY; Lines Drawn for Renewed Battles Over Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-lines-drawn-for-renewed-battles-over-abortion.html,The battle over womens constitutional right to obtain abortions has been fought in two main arenas Congress and the Supreme Court Antiabortion forces have changed tactics on both fronts from trying to outlaw abortion to cutting off access to it Now prochoice forces are trying to break the blockades In the Senate this week Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon plans to resume his filibuster on a measure that would ban Federal financing for virtually all abortions The measure is an amendment to a bill on the national debt and thus resembles other riders through which Congress has curbed Federal financing of abortions But by making the restrictions permanent opponents of the measure argue it changes by statute what the Supreme Court said exists by constitutional right  a womans freedom to have an abortion if she chooses A vote on ending the filibuster is scheduled for Thursday The Court itself is due to act in winter when it hears five appeals covering a host of restrictive state and local laws But the American Medical Association the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists together with the colleges Nursing Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics called their members to arms last week urging the Court to declare unconstitutional the Akron Ohio ordinance which is considered the most wideranging The ordinance mandates that abortions after the first three months of pregnancy be performed only in hospitals forbids doctors from performing abortions on girls under age 15 without parental or court consent and requires doctors to read patients a statement on the procedures alleged hazards The medical groups said the ordinance obstructs sound medical practice by requiring doctors to provide women with inaccurate baseless or irrelevant information Doctors must say for example that abortion is dangerous when health experts say it is remarkably safe
SCREEN BEAUTY TELLS ALL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/books/screen-beauty-tells-all.html,LANA The Lady the Legend the Truth By Lana Turner Illustrated 311 pp New York E P Dutton 1495 I AM not just a manufactured something a star from Hollywoods golden age I am a real live breathing human being with faults and good points like anybody else Its that same old book again long associated with beautyparlor hair dryers and assorted chocolate creams and this year it has Lana Turners name on it She calls it Lana The Lady the Legend the Truth a rather odd title for an autobiography and her reason for writing it sounds as familiar as the poem Trees For years publishers have begged me to tell my own story but up to now Ive always turned them down  for all these years I have had to live with headlines and gossip columns and intrusions into my personal life but I refuse to leave this earth with that pile of moviemagazine trash scandal and slander as my epitaph So now Im ready to share what Ive always kept private to set the record straight Whoever wrote the prototype of that is dust now but the formula still sells in spite of the fact that it has been challenged in recent years by a number of truly frank original reminiscences about Hollywood including Christina Crawfords Mommie Dearest and Lulu in Hollywood by Louise Brooks Meanwhile runofthemill autobiographies of screen beauties continue to resemble one another to an amazing degree  first because they usually consist of the same ragstoriches story invariably involving a string of marriages to famous people and scandal of some sort but also I suspect because most of the reading their authors have done consisted of melodramatic scripts fan mail movie magazines gossip columns and other screen memoirs No matter how much the sex goddesses tear their nails on Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper in the course of their confessions they are the literary daughters of those two Olympians continually substituting fantasy for fact cliche for insight cuteness for character innuendo for wit and dudgeon for dignity As these books go Lana is pretty bad in fact often bad enough to be good For example she says of her most recent husband His name was Ronald Dante  and still is I suppose His real name was Ronald Peller and he called himself a doctor although of what Im not exactly sure Now is that supposed to be funny Sarcastic Ingenuous All of these None of these Who can tell Miss Turner is not solely at fault for this dreadfully written book in the last paragraph she declares that it is a collaborative effort and the copyright is held by Eltee Productions and Hollis Alpert the film critic and editor However in the last sentence she insists on taking full responsibility for her life and her book So be it The Sweater Girl now 61 has appeared in more than 50 pictures three road shows and a television series She has had seven husbands including band leader Artie Shaw millionaire Bob Topping and movie Tarzan Lex Barker Owing to legal complications she married two husbands twice but she never did marry the great love of her life Tyrone Power who left her for Linda Christian In addition to two abortions a suicide attempt and a serious drinking problem she has survived the most nightmarish of all Hollywood scandals In 1958 her only daughter Cheryl then 14 burst into a bedroom where Miss Turner was having an argument with her lover John Stompanato a flashy racketeer and stabbed Stompanato to death Twentytwo years later in 1980 through the agency of a holistic doctor Miss Turner found God Thats quite a record to set straight in 311 pages THE 60 pages she spends on her affair with Stompanato which lasted a year and the 15 on the Tyrone Power affair read like Bmovie scripts From her accounts its as difficult to understand why she couldnt get rid of Stompanato before it was too late as it is to know why she failed to win Power The bulk of the book is the very gossip and drivel Miss Turner says drove her to take up her pen in the first place and the story of her life is fleshed out with trivia unembarrassed by many exact dates Of her highschool days she says I decided to float along trying  to keep my grades up if not the As at least at the B and B level Now and then a C would turn up or occasionally a dreadful D And once in mathematics the fatal F and you know that F didnt stand for fun Of John Garfield her leading man in The Postman Always Rings Twice He had a penchant for picking up girls sometimes two at a time and a reputation as a demon lover He died young in bed which was understandable Of customs officials in Buenos Aires They especially enjoyed handling my underwear Grrh And so on Only in her final summing up of the Lana the press has never understood has she added new dimension to the Urtext But the essential me is still intact I still love music  melodic orchestral music and the sound of violins and cellos Give me anything thats romantic Chopin Tchaikovsky Rachmaninoff Mahler Minor chords affect me more than major chords I like colors to be definite I dont care for muted colors except the beautiful lilacs and lavenders But thats my romantic side coming out again I love sunshine who doesnt feel terrific when the sun is shining and warming you But I also love rain Real pouring rain not the drizzling kind If its going to rain then rain Dont just futz around A heavy rain and me indoors enclosed in my own privacy If I dont laugh at least three times during the day Ive had a bad day Ive got to have a minimum of at least three good laughs I wouldnt have survived without my sense of humor and thank God I have always been able to laugh at myself Im very close to God I read the Daily Word and I have learned to meditate Im still getting used to this New Woman  after all shes only two years old Surely they never wrote it like that before
MODERN JEWISH MOTHER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/books/modern-jewish-mother.html, Annie Gottlieb is a freelance critic THE LOVE OF ELSPETH BAKER By Myron S Kaufmann 680 pp New York Arbor House 1695 By ANNIE GOTTLIEB MYRON S KAUFMANN is a man who takes his time His bestselling first novel Remember Me to God was published in 1957 his second novel Thy Daughters Nakedness appeared in 1968 The Love of Elspeth Baker is his third Theres a certain unfashionable dignity about that pace a quiet stubbornness a disdain for hurry that prevails within Mr Kaufmanns novels as well as between them The Love of Elspeth Baker is a vast patient book Theres time in it to observe a dragonfly hovering above a summer swimming pool a piece of paper blowing down a cold Boston street the shape of an oldfashioned bell pull Theres time for an 18yearold girls deft repair of a car transmission and a toilet to be narrated in minute detail time for a baby to ripen slowly in her womb and finally to be born contraction by contraction and then to grow and be patiently diapered and suckled while his spirited unmarried mother tries to figure out what to do with her life Mr Kaufmann actually tells us almost every time his heroine Elspeth shifts the baby Petey from one breast to the other but far from maddening the repetition of such little acts of motherhood becomes a lulling leitmotif that wins the readers patience There is time too for many of the books characters to argue at length about God whom they regard with a spectrum of feelings distinctively Jewish despair exasperation befuddled awe I told the rabbi God is meshuggeh I told him straight out God is meshuggeh says Elspeths embittered father Joe Baker who should know He has lost one son to Vietnam and the other to a freak medical accident and now his adored baby daughter best mechanic and righthand woman in his hardware store has come home from Mount Holyoke with a big belly God isnt Santa Claus counters Elspeths newly Orthodox cousin Bob Shoemaker an MIT marine biologist Who are we to presume that God is morally bound to run the universe in a way thats convenient for us How selfcentered can we get These two qualities of The Love of Elspeth Baker  profusion of mundane detail and ebullient longwinded religious speculation  are separate aspects of one vision Mr Kaufmanns fascination with the surprises of biology and the inventory of hardware stores has everything to do with his respect for the Creator of this perverse and intricate world He knows as much about being here now as Baba Ram Dass or any Zen Buddhist And indeed one of the points this novel unashamedly makes through Bob Shoemaker and his community of froomies from the Yiddish word frum or pious is that the Jewish tradition can provide everything its sons and daughters have been seeking in more exotic places mystical rapture zest for the natural life of the body a sense of community a comprehensive standard of humane conduct did you know that the Talmud solemnly forbids making fun of people In short as Bob says it provides a vision of the good society But the proselytizing in this book  talky repetitive and very appealing  doesnt interfere with the pleasures of the plot which tells how Elspeth picks her way by healthy instinct and luck through the million hazards of a world gone awry Her passage to motherhood is assailed by every kind of false wisdom a lifedenying culture can produce Its not even like taking an appendix out Or a tooth out Its not even part of you says the Amherst freshman who is the father of Elspeths child and who has paid for an abortion I suggest you forget about natural childbirth an obstetrician tells her Its nonsense frankly And Elspeths fathers lawyer advises Breastfeeding isnt the most sanitary thing in the world  You cant boil the female breast and sterilize it Without quite knowing why  and with considerable suspense  Elspeth flees two abortionists gives birth by Lamaze insists on breastfeeding even though shes giving the baby up for adoption steals him from the nursery and the night before signing adoption papers runs away from the hospital with him Shes right of course and she finds allies a ponytailed male medical resident an old Jewish landlady a young Italian lawyer a woman who runs a gas station her cousin Bob and his religious community She also meets a kind wealthy older man who wants to marry her baby and all but who like most assimilated Jews in the story is revolted by the froomies and dismayed by Elspeths increasing attraction to them Among the bookss many pleasures are its plain language a fine imaginative sympathy on the part of a middleaged male writer for the young and the female and a poignant portrayal of a great baffled love between father and daughter The main flaw apart from the characters speechifying is that Elspeth is a little too good to be true A gorgeous redhead with breasts like pagodas who fixes a flooded engine while in labor and pumps gas with one arm while cradling her nursing baby with the other does stretch credibility Nonetheless shes a lovely superheroine

LEHRMAN AND CURRAN SPAR OVER ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/06/nyregion/lehrman-and-curran-spar-over-abortion.html,Although opposed to abortion and the use of Medicaid funds to pay for it Lewis E Lehrman and Paul J Curran rivals for the Republican nomination for Governor disagreed yesterday on a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortions I dont believe you can effectively prohibit abortion by law Mr Lehrman said I favor such an amendment Mr Curran said The abortion issue is generally considered more formidable in a Republican primary than in a Democratic primary because the Republican electorate in the state is considered to include more Roman Catholics and conservatives who generally oppose abortion Both men said they had not sought the endorsement of the Right to Life Party  Mr Lehrman because of his position on the amendment and Mr Curran because he does not believe in singleissue parties Not Much Campaigning The dispute over abortion was one of several areas in which the two Republicans disagreed in a day of light campaigning less than three weeks before the Sept 23 primary Mr Curran had no other appearances scheduled while Mr Lehrman later campaigned on sunny but breezy beachfronts at Breezy Point Queens On the Democratic side Mayor Koch joined Mr Curran in assailing what they contend was Mr Lehrmans avoidance of New York State and city taxes in the 196976 period when Mr Lehrman and his family resided in a Fifth Avenue apartment but maintained a legal residence in Pennsylvania where taxes are lower Mr Lehrman reiterated that he had not legally changed his residence until 1977 when he left the presidency of the RiteAid Corporation which has its headquarters in Harrisburg Pa Voluntarily I came to the highest taxed state in the continental United States he added I dont know whether its legal or illegal but I know its immoral said Mr Koch on the WCBSTV Newsmakers program Thats not acceptable for somebody who wants to hold public office in this state Mayor Flies to Fair in Syracuse The Mayor was the busiest of the four candidates  dropping in at the United States Open tennis matches at Forest Hills before flying to Syracuse for the state fair and later to Albany for an airport news conference His opponent for the Democratic nomination for Governor Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo did not campaign But he issued a statement in which he declared that the Mayors proposal to increase state aid to localities and school districts would inevitably result in added state taxes He cant do it any other way Mr Cuomo said adding that this is a major issue of this campaign The joint interview of the Republicans on the WNBCTV News Forum program produced an unusual number of differences between the two Republican candidates On taxes Mr Lehrman said that if elected he would start an eightyear program of tax cuts in the fiscal year beginning next April He cant deliver on that promise said Mr Curran He added that the new Governor must first systematically reduce spending  then and only then can you start to reduce the tax burden Mr Lehrman advocated tax incentives for businesses that clean up toxic wastes while Mr Curran said polluting companies should bear the cleanup costs themselves How Best to Appoint Judges Mr Curran said he favored the appointment of lower court judges rather than their election while Mr Lehrman said he favored the current system of electing most judges Mr Koch asked about his mistakes as Mayor said that his greatest failure was my inability to convey my administrations enormous positive record as it relates to minorities Declaring that during his tenure in City Hall the percentage of minority civil servants summer workers and college students had risen the Mayor added I dont think Ive gotten credit for it Undoubtedly its my fault He said that one explanation was that I tell things as they are and sometimes it rubs people the wrong way Mr Koch also defended his campaign absences from City Hall contending that he was still working more than a 40hour week and was on call seven days a week I dont think the city has suffered he said
SPEAKING OF THE BREAKUP OF 'THE TEAM',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/06/us/speaking-of-the-breakup-of-the-team.html,It is time now to speak of the likelihood of changes on the Reagan team For 18 months President Reagans men have enjoyed the political equivalent of a championship season But it is hard to find anyone among them who thinks all the key players will remain at their old positions far into the second half of the term Not that anything will happen very suddenly By tradition administrations delay staff and Cabinet shakeups until after the election and the Reagan Administration will follow that tradition But the expectation of change and conflict has brought a striking shift in mood White House aides who once spoke reverently of the Presidents belief in team play now predict a time of turmoil after the November elections The big question to them is what if anything the President thinks about realigning his staff Im not sure the President has focused on that said a senior official adding that by the first of the year Mr Reagan will have to decide who will go and who will stay So far he indicated the Presidents senior advisers have been reluctant to remind him of the inevitability of the situation There is a strong feeling among middlelevel aides that the present fourheaded command structure must be realigned under a chief of staff with broader authority Now of course the nominal chief of staff James A Baker 3d shares power with Michael K Deaver the deputy chief William P Clark the national security adviser and Edwin Meese 3d the Presidents counselor Secondlevel advisers who do much of the important administrative work have been frustrated by the breakdown in communications among the four Natural attrition may solve part of the problem Mr Deaver for example keeps telling associates that he will return to the public relations business next year For the others there is a multitude of scenarios Mr Baker to the Cabinet Mr Meese to the Supreme Court and so on The point is that change and therefore showdowns among the heavies are regarded as inevitable A probable tipoff to a big battle will be resignations or reassignments among such prominent junior aides as Richard G Darman David R Gergen Rich Williamson and Larry Speakes At all levels there is a keen awareness that it is better to use a White House job to jump to a good position elsewhere than to hang around and be cut up in an inhouse fight The expectation of change accounts for the autumnal mood among Reagan aides who should otherwise be jubilant about a string of legislative victories and bold foreign policy moves These are professionals who know that the first phase of the Reagan Presidency is winding down and that not all of them will be around for the second There is not so much personal animosity among them as an awareness that for all the binding force of Mr Reagans genial personality they have reached the limits of team play The President and his advisers have been surprised to discover how hard it is to keep conservatives happy They have in fact given up on regaining the support of Richard Viguerie and John Lofton the publisher and editor who have made Conservative Digest one of the most militantly antiReagan journals But this attitude does not extend to the socalled street corner conservatives who are viewed as the essential members of the Reagan coalition This constituency in the White House view does not respond so much to economic and foreign policy issues as to such domestic social concerns as busing crime school prayer and abortion Mr Reagan pressed by the need to build a Congressional majority for his economic policies has not been as aggressive on these issues as his supporters expected In regard to crime at least the White House hopes to change this perception of inactivity Mr Meese a former prosecuting attorney who is a bona fide hardliner on law enforcement has been preparing a major initiative in criminal law The theme in the Presidents legislative recommendations he indicated will be a strengthening of police prosecutors and state criminal courts and on the Federal level a crackdown on narcotics importation Mr Meese envisions a tightening of the insanity defense and changes in the exclusionary rule that will make it harder to throw out evidence in criminal cases The Administration is also considering legislation to limit the circumstances under which Federal courts can intervene in a criminal case after it has been through the appeals process at the state level Mr Meese said that the Administration would also push for stronger forfeiture laws that will enable the seizing of bank accounts boats and airplanes involved in narcotics smuggling Some of these measures seem certain to arouse opposition among civil libertarians That in itself could enhance their political appeal as could the Presidents plan to appoint a task force on the victims of crime Mr Reagan is scheduled to return to the capital Monday after more than two weeks in California Most of that time he was at his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains White House aides were displeased by a Newsweek article charting the frequency with which Mr Reagan leaves Washington for this and other palmy retreats Even so they scheduled few of the public events used in the past to create the impression that Mr Reagan takes

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/briefing-133524.html,Reagan Moves on Abortion D irectmail computers have been running overtime in the Congressional recess as antiabortion groups stepped up their campaign to apply grass roots pressure on the Senate debate over a proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortions While the computers tried to activate the grass roots President Reagan picked up the telephone to work on reluctant Senators The President made a number of telephone calls during the past weekend to Republican Senators whose votes are needed to end the filibuster against the antiabortion bill introduced by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina The Senators he called are those who dont support the Helms bill but in the name of fair play might be persuaded to vote for cloture said Peter B Gemma Jr executive director of the National ProLife Political Action Committee Its exciting This is the first time the President has come through for us asking for action on a specific piece of legislation and putting the White House on line with us Mr Gemma said he had been told by White House officials that the President also intends to follow up his phone calls with a letter to Senators If the letter goes out in the same form as it arrived on his desk said another antiabortion activist its going to be dynamite Even with the Presidents lobbying effort Mr Gemma said antiabortion forces expect to lose the first cloture vote which is expected to come Thursday but hope to win a second vote a few days later The reason Mr Gemma has written off the first cloture vote is that a number of antiabortion Senators wont be back from overseas trips in time for the rollcall Study and Celebration T he Urban Institute a nonpartisan research organization here is getting ready to release a study of the Reagan Administrations first 18 months The study The Reagan Experiment is the work of 27 researchers who were guided by the premise that the Presidents policies represent the most dramatic change in domestic priorities since the New Deal In Washington however rarely are such works just released and left to stand or fall Before the public will know the studys contents there will be a period of celebration and promotion Official Washington is invited to a reception to be given by William D Ruckelshaus chairman of the Urban Institute at the Hall of the States five days before the study is released on Sept 14 Entertainment will feature a satirical skit by the Capitol Steps a bipartisan group of House and Senate staff members Meanwhile a public relations concern has been hired by the institute to book some of the reports authors on radio and televison programs A Move Resisted S outhwest Washington with its clusters of urban renewal highrise apartments and shopping malls next to lowincome housing projects requires a bit of pioneer spirit on the part of the people who live and work there Outsiders might assume that Federal employees assigned to offices in this highcrime area would like nothing better than to move to a downtown location where the streets are animated by vendors shops and good restaurants all within an easy walk of subway stops Not necessarily so the Department of Education has found The department this week begins moving several hundred of its employees from their Southwest offices to an office tower on M Street in the name of consolidating its research and improvement division Local 2607 of the American Federation of Government Employees which represents the workers has waged an unsuccessful fight against the move raising arguments about economy and productivity that are not often heard from Federal employee unions The union contends that the new location will cost 225000 a year more in rent at a time when Education Secretary TH Bell is applying austerity measures throughout his department Education employees however concede that their real concern is more selfish The move downtown they explain would disrupt car pools and cost them more money for parking and lunches Meanwhile the union wanting to find out whether politics might be involved has asked officials for a list of political contributions to both political parties by the owners of the downtown office building It may be a long shot but as Nathan Cohen the local shop steward put it These kind of things do go on in Washington Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr
"Keep Talking, Senators",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/opinion/keep-talking-senators.html,This week the Senate must choose between talking about abortions and school prayers and doing something about them We favor talk The proposal on the floor so disfigures the law the Constitution and individual liberties that still more wind from Capitol Hill is preferable by far Senator Jesse Helms wants to add two legislative subversions of Supreme Court decisions on abortion and school prayer to a pending bill to raise the national debt ceiling Under the abortion measure Congress would find that the Court erred in permitting a woman the right to terminate her pregnancy It would declare that life begins at conception even though the Court has said that enactment of a particular view about when life begins is beyond the power of a legislature The measure would also invite state legislatures to ban abortions and provide for direct appeal to the Supreme Court to give the justices quick opportunity to reverse their views since 1972 Mr Helmss proposal on abortion at least recognizes the Supreme Courts right to the final word Not so his prayer proposal It would deny the power of any Federal court to rule on a state or local law permitting or requiring voluntary prayers in public schools and buildings Such laws would again defy Supreme Court decisions Senator Helms says correctly that the Senate passed the same bill in 1979 But Congress and the nation now know much more about the dangers of such killtheumpire ideas As Senators Packwood Weicker Baucus Kennedy Moynihan and others have pointed out the issue transcends the merits of prayer and the correctness of the Supreme Court decisions It challenges the basic authority of the Federal courts to interpret the law and the Constitution If the courts can be stripped of power whenever they make decisions that are unpopular with a transient majority little is left of the Constitutions safeguards for liberty Attempts to circumvent the Supreme Courts constitutional rulings by statute are themselves arguably unconstitutional Even the Reagan Justice Department holds that cutting off all Federal court relief violates the Constitution the Administration more forthrightly than Senator Helms proposes a constitutional amendment on prayer Even if constitutional the Helms scheme is profoundly unwise If ever the antiabortion and propublic prayer forces get their act together they should pursue the harder path of a constitutional amendment Only their disarray has saved the nation from serious damage so far The Helms riders are cheap end runs around a delicately balanced system Let the Senate keep talking
FISCAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES AWAIT CONGRESS AS IT RECONVENES FOR FINAL; WEEKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/fiscal-and-social-issues-await-congress-as-it-reconvenes-for-final-weeks.html,Congress will confront four major fiscal issues and two major social issues when it reconvenes Wednesday for the final weeks of the session The waning days of the 97th Congress will focus primarily on Federal outlays and deficits on the spending priorities and fiscal restraints that have predominated since members took the oath of office 20 months ago That emphasis has rankled many members who have complained that other issues have been pushed aside In addition in a session expected to last four weeks Congress will deal in what some conservatives consider their last best hope with proposals to curtail abortions and advance school prayer The fiscal battles will again pit Congress against the White House which has won almost every fiscal fight since this Congress was sworn in They will also pit the Democraticcontrolled House against the Republicancontrolled Senate and provide an opportunity for both parties to compile campaign records intended to appeal to voters in this falls elections Republicans plan to stress their commitment to fiscal austerity which they contend has already resulted in lower interest rates and an overall improvement in the economy Democrats hope to portray themselves as the party of compassion and are pledged to seek more financing for cities minority groups and the elderly and handicapped Democratic leaders have proposed a 1 billion job package for areas of severe unemployment but this is widely regarded more as electionyear rhetoric than as a realistic prospect We just cant seem to get away from the fiscal issues said the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee Conservatives Last Hope Many Congressional conservatives will be seeking to win longstanding battles over abortion and school prayer They say they fear that the new Congress to be elected this fall could be far less conservative and even less likely to adopt such legislation Two separate antiabortion measures will be debated by the Senate which will also consider a move to reverse the Supreme Court decision banning organized school prayer The fourweek session will also be affected by the possibility of a special postelection session to deal with revisions of the Social Security system which is threatened with insolvency Although some powerful committee chairmen are seeking such a session the idea has evoked a lukewarm response from both Senator Baker and House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts Were required by law to be back the first week in December to organize our committees and get ready for the new session the Speaker said He added that House members would be on hand to consider Social Security if the need arose but neither he nor Mr Baker supports a special session except in the unlikely event that a study commission came up with a strong bipartisan recommendation for the system Should President Reagan call for a postelection session however he could influence the decision Social Security benefits could thus be trimmed without fear of voter retaliation at the polls The Presidents political power is expected to become readily apparent when Congress takes up its first issue an effort to override his veto of a 141 billion supplemental appropriation bill Congressional leaders of both parties acknowledged that such an override was highly unlikely and Congress is therefore expected to seek to fashion a spending bill that he can support Funds Needed by Sept 15 About 6 billion of the 14 billion was earmarked for pay increases Unless these funds are provided by Sept 15 as is expected most Government employees will face furloughs Although the bill was nearly 2 billion less than Mr Reagan had sought it contained 21 billion less for military spending than he wanted and 918 million in social spending for youths students and the elderly which he considered unacceptably high The bill also contained 350 million for his project to provide aid in the Caribbean The supplemental spending bill is needed to keep the Government operating through Sept 30 the end of the fiscal year A more dramatic dispute between the President and Congress is likely to arise over an omnibus spending bill called a continuing resolution needed to finance the Government beginning Oct 1 Congress has failed to complete action on any of the 13 separate appropriation bills that provide Government financing and the omnibus bill is therefore needed to authorize Federal spending Without such financing Attorney General William French Smith has ruled Government agencies have no choice but to shut down Although that threat has been heard almost annually it is not given much credibility because it has never been carried out However the White House has used it effectively in the past to pressure Congress into compromises that could otherwise have proved elusive Debate on Debt Ceiling A third fiscal debate focuses on legislation to increase the debt ceiling from just over 1000 billion to 1290 billion a measure the Administration is seeking to enable the Government to pay debts already incurred Conservatives have seized on this issue and are seeking to attach amendments on abortion and school prayer contending that they will be passed by the House only if attached to a money bill A cloture vote on an antiabortion amendment to the debt limit bill is pending in the Senate Two Senate Republican moderates Bob Packwood of Oregon and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut had filibustered against one of two antiabortion measures proposed by conservatives The bill offered by Senator Jesse A Helms Republican of North Carolina would include a Congressional finding that the Supreme Court erred in its 1973 decision legalizing abortion by not recognizing the humanity of the unborn and by not entitling fetuses to protection under the Constitution The antiabortion amendment is coupled with one that would counter the Courts decision on school prayer Another antiabortion strategy a proposed constitutional amendment sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah would give Congress and the states joint authority to restrict abortions There has been no effort to attach this measure to the debt limit bill however To further complicate the debate on the debt limit Democrats have served notice that they will withhold votes in favor of the increase unless a majority of Republicans support it Balanced Budget Amendment The legislators will also come to grips with a proposed Constitutional amendment that would require Congress to adopt a balanced budget each year unless threefifths of its members approved deficit spending The measure was approved last month by the Senate but remains bottled up in the House Judiciary Committee whose chairman Peter W Rodino Jr Democrat of New Jersey is leading the opposition to the bill A petition that would enable the bill to reach the floor has slightly fewer than the required signatures of a majority of House members and a major push is expected when Congress reconvenes To the relief of most members they will not have to come to grips with a second budget resolution this fall The chairmen of both the House and Senate Budget Committees have agreed not to press for another one and the first resolution adopted last spring will thus become binding The House may also consider the first major revision in immigration laws in 30 years The measure was approved last month by the Senate and has been approved by a House Judiciary subcommittee But the House leadership has not yet decided whether to seek to bring it to the floor In addition the House may debate a regulatory revision that would make wholesale changes in the Administrative Practices Act to make it more difficult for Federal agencies to promulgate regulations This bill was also approved by the Senate and the House Judiciary Committee and is expected to reach the House floor Several major environmental bills are also pending A reauthorization and revision of the Clean Air Act was approved by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and is now before the House Energy and Commerce Committee
PROPER HELMSMEN: THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/opinion/proper-helmsmen-the-court.html,The Senate adjourned for Labor Day in the middle of what most people believed was a filibuster against an amendment that would reverse the Supreme Courts historic 1962 decision preventing states from requiring prayer in public schools Nothing could be further from reality The amendment at issue sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina would not overturn the 1962 decision What it would do is prevent the Supreme Court and other Federal courts from considering future school prayer cases thereby threatening the Courts ability  and right  to interpret the Constitution If Congress can strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction over school prayer cases there is no provision in the Constitution immune from Congressional tampering Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona says I see no limit to the practice There is no clear and coherent standard to define why we shall control the Court in one area but not another The only criteria seems sic to be that whenever a momentary majority can be brought together in disagreement with a judicial action it is fitting to control the Federal courts Momentary majorities can exert enormous pressure on Congress as anyone who has tangled with the National Conservative Political Action Committee and the rest of the New Right knows But courtstripping bills pose a possible constitutional crisis that could prove the most serious since the Civil War according to the president of the American Bar Association Morris Harrell Attorney General William French Smith shares that concern He maintains that Congresss power over Federal court jurisdiction cannot interfere with the core functions of the Supreme Court and argues that the integrity of our system of Federal law depends upon a single court of last resort having a final say on the resolution of Federal questions Despite objections from people such as Attorney General Smith and Senator Goldwater and organizations such as the ABA Senator Helmss courtstripping proposal has gained an alarming amount of support Three years ago the Senate voted 51 to 40 for a proposal identical to this years Helms amendment that bill died in the House Senators the press and the public all thought that vote was a referendum on school prayer I hope this perception has changed The Senate may vote on the Helms amendment soon I hope a majority of Senators will reject this radical proposal Those of us who realize the implications of this measure have an obligation to prevent it from passing We will continue our filibuster until every avenue is closed The Founding Fathers provided a way to reverse unpopular Supreme Court decisions a constitutional amendment The Framers of the Constitution wisely understood that constitutional principles must not be sacrificed on the altar of political appeasement Courtstripping does an endrun around the constitutionalamendment process and thereby undermines the Constitution itself School prayer abortion and school busing are indeed controversial issues I doubt that there ever will be complete agreement on the publicpolicy questions they raise But as those who support the filibuster in the Senate understand Article V of the Constitution provides a means of resolving these disputes Lets not take the shortcut offered by Senator Helms  Max Baucus Democrat of Montana is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee
CUOMO AND CURRAN ATTACK RIVALS AS BARRAGE OF CRITICISM CONTINUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/08/nyregion/cuomo-and-curran-attack-rivals-as-barrage-of-criticism-continues.html,Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo promised yesterday that if he became governor state taxes would not go up He said taxes would rise if Mayor Koch his opponent in the Democratic primary kept his pledges on new state aid The Mayor has obviously studied at the Ronald Reagan school of economics which preaches that if you take care of the rich they will take care of the rest of us Mr Cuomo said On the Republican side Paul J Curran said his opponent Lewis E Lehrman either lied directly or played games with the facts He listed what he called five spitters and 10 curveballs by Mr Lehrman saying his opponent has done for truth in this campaign what the American consumer did for the Edsel  made it a collectors item Campaign Strategies Vary While Mr Cuomo and Mr Curran who politicians believe are behind in the Sept 23 primary were making their sharp attacks at news conferences their opponents opened the postLabor Day phase of the campaign differently Mr Lehrman spent the day making more film for his package of television commercials and his supporters filed 57246 signatures in Albany to give him an additional line on the ballot as the candidate of the Statewide Independent Party Mr Koch strolled out to the steps at City Hall to announce the endorsement of Representative Geraldine A Ferraro of Queens The Mayors aides said he would soon start a number of new TV spots with some good endorsements At his campaign headquarters at 15 West 39th Street Mr Cuomo said that Mr Koch in some of their debates had promised to raise state school aid and revenue sharing to localities He says hes for spending 1 billion we dont have  but hes against taxes Mr Cuomo said Mr Cuomo said there were many budget imponderables But he said that if he became Governor One thing I would take out of the maybe category is tax increases  I would say no  In reply the Koch campaign press secretary Martin McLaughlin said The Mayor has repeatedly stated that he would only raise taxes in the eventuality that all other avenues were closed He Added that in a Buffalo debate Mr Cuomo had also urged increased aid to localities Mr Curran at his news conference in the Roosevelt Hotel said Its time to pull together the credibility issues that have surfaced I reviewed all the items from the taxes which is a weighty one he said This was a reference to Mr Currans previous attacks on Mr Lehrman for not having paid New York State income taxes from 1969 to 1975 when Mr Lehrman listed himself as a Pennsylvania resident although his wife and children lived in New York City Mr Curran also said Mr Lehrman had shifted positions on abortion and shifted stories about his voting history and efforts to win the support of Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau County Republican Party leader who backs Mr Curran Mr Lehrmans press secretary John Buckley said So many of the items on Mr Currans latest litany are of a dishonest or disingenuous nature that one can only throw up ones hands
A TIME OF TRANSITION FOR NO. 2 COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/08/us/a-time-of-transition-for-no-2-court.html,Its sort of the last bastion of liberalism and the question is whether it will hold said Joseph L Rauh Jr a leading public interest lawyer here who fervently hopes that it will Its giving one damned good last hurrah for the maintenance of a powerful regulatory system run out of Washington complained a Reagan Administration official who sometimes would like to see it disappear in a puff of smoke Both were talking about the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Sitting in tranquil dignity in the Federal Courthouse just down the street from the Capitol the DC Circuit as lawyers call it is the nations principal judicial reviewer of Federal regulations and is widely regarded as its most powerful tribunal after the Supreme Court It is also a target of efforts by conservatives and business lobbyists in Congress who want to take away some of its powers by shifting part of its caseload to other Federal courts and of efforts by President Reagan to use his power of appointment to make the Federal judiciary more conservative Ruling on Auto Safety Known for more than three decades as a hotbed of liberal judicial activism the DC Circuit remains a favorite of environmentalists consumer activists labor unions and civil rights groups and a bete noir of conservatives and business interests Just last month for example a threejudge panel of the appeals court delighted consumer activists and enraged Administration officials by ruling that all new automobiles sold after September 1983 must be equipped with air bags or automatic seat belts The panels action together with a related decision in June overruled a centerpiece of the Administrations program of regulatory relief for business and reinstated a regulation that the Administration had rescinded because it would cost consumers and the auto industry 1 billion annually The Justice Department plans to appeal to the Supreme Court on Wednesday It has already appealed several other recent DC Circuit decisions including a ruling written by Judge J Skelly Wright this spring that barred operation of the second undamaged nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission assessed the psychological stress on people in the neighborhood Reversals by Supreme Court In still another case being appealed by the Justice Department a threejudge panel of the DC Circuit awarded more than 90000 in attorneys fees and costs to two environmental groups for bringing a lawsuit against the Government even though the Government prevailed against them on every issue in the suit The DC Circuits vast although not exclusive power to review the legality of regulatory actions stems from its jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Federal District Court here where many suits against the Government are filed and from dozens of statutes that make actions by various agencies directly appealable to it The more conservative Supreme Court has reversed a considerable number of DC Circuit decisions on politically charged issues in recent years But the appeals court has the final say on the legality of many regulations and other issues that involve billions of dollars and have a national impact because the Supreme Court has time to review only a small fraction of its decisions Conservatives and business interests seeking to cut the DC Circuits powers have waged innumerable tugs of war in Congress over the years against liberal public interest types who like to take their cases to the DC Circuit Currently Congress is considering a complex venue bill favored by the Administration and such conservative Senators as Alan K Simpson Republican of Wyoming and Paul Laxalt Republican of Nevada to cut the DC Circuits powers by shifting much of its regulatory caseload to Federal courts in the parts of the country where the regulatory actions in question would have the greatest impact Two Conservative Appointees The proposal has little chance of passing this year but it will be back after this falls elections Meanwhile the DC Circuits future as a bastion of liberalism is very much in doubt In the past year Mr Reagan has appointed to the court two politically conservative academics with impeccable scholarly credentials Robert H Bork formerly of Yale Law School and Antonin Scalia formerly of the University of Chicago Law School These appointments cut the DC Circuits liberal majority long led by Judge Wright and Judge David L Bazelon to six of the courts 11 fulltime judges One more vacancy would give the President an opportunity to tip the balance against the liberal wing which includes Chief Judge Spottswood W Robinson 2d and the four judges appointed by President Carter Judge Bazelon 73 years old who joined in the recent decision on air bags took parttime senior status two years ago and thus has no vote in cases before the full court Judges Wright and Bork represent the philosophical antipodes of the court although the shorthand labels liberal and conservative tend to obscure the fact that they agree with each another and their colleagues on many of the legal issues that come before them Appointed to the court by President Kennedy in 1962 after a pioneering role in desegregating schools as a Federal District Judge in New Orleans Judge Wright 71 has been a champion of minorities the poor and the powerless rarely hesitating to strike down actions by other branches of Government that offend his sense of justice A Household Name He has also voted for aggressive implementation of vaguely worded Federal regulatory laws designed to protect the health and safety of workers consumers and the environment as in the Three Mile Island opinion Judge Bork who became a household name by carrying out President Nixons order to dismiss Archibald Cox as Watergate special prosecutor in 1973 has long been an apostle of judicial restraint and deference to the legislative and executive branches in setting national policies Before his appointment he was a cogent critic of many of the Supreme Courts constitutional innovations of recent decades such as those reapportioning state legislatures requiring largescale busing to desegregate schools and legalizing abortion What Judges Wright Bork Bazelon Scalia and others on the DC Circuit have in common is a reputation for exceptional intellectual ability and for a scholarly approach that has produced some of the longest most elaborately reasoned most heavily footnoted judicial opinions ever written Many of those decisions are excerpted in law school textbooks Explaining why he was not overly concerned about the political conservatism of the two Reagan appointees Alan B Morrison a public interest lawyer and consumer activist who heads the Public Citizen Litigation Group remarked recently As a litigator Ill take a smart judge any time
REAGAN BACKS ANTI-ABORTION BILL AS OPPONENTS RESUME FILIBUSTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/09/us/reagan-backs-anti-abortion-bill-as-opponents-resume-filibuster.html,As Congress returned to work today after the Labor Day recess President Reagan fulfilled a campaign promise and threw his weight behind legislation now before the Senate that could sharply limit a womans right to an abortion The President has been under great pressure from conservative supporters to get involved in the abortion battle which Congressional leaders and the White House have been trying to avoid for the last 18 months To many on Capitol Hill Mr Reagans endorsement of the antiabortion legislation was primarily a political move that would have little impact on the Senate debate My personal view is that his heart is not in it said Senator Max Baucus a Montana Democrat and a leading opponent of antiabortion legislation Its a token appeasement for the right wing In two letters to Capitol Hill the President urged lawmakers to support a proposal by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would permanently ban Federal financing for all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger The Helms bill also declares that the Supreme Court made a mistake when it legalized abortion in 1973 and provides for a direct appeal to the Court if any state should pass antiabortion legislation Cloture Move Likely to Fail When the Senate resumed business today after a twoweek holiday opponents of the Helms bill resumed the filibuster that they began last month The Helms forces will try Thursday to end that delaying tactic by invoking cloture but the move requires the support of 60 Senate members and is expected to fail at least on the first try In one of his letters Mr Reagan praised Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader for his efforts to invoke cloture You are providing the Senate the President wrote to the Tennessee Republican an opportunity to stand up and be counted on what I think is one of the most important issues of our time In his second letter to nine wavering Senators Mr Reagan asserted that it is vitally important for the Congress to affirm as this amendment does the fundamental principle that all human life has intrinsic value The Helms bill has been offered as an amendment to legislation raising the ceiling on the national debt a measure that must pass by the end of the month to prevent the Federal Government from running out of borrowing authority In addition Senator Helms has proposed a second amendment to the debt limit bill one that would overturn Supreme Court decisions banning voluntary prayer in public schools Agenda of Social Issues Since January 1981 when Mr Reagan took office conservatives have been eagerly promoting an agenda of socalled social issues including legislation to ban abortion permit school prayer and outlaw school busing for racial integration Mr Reagan supported these goals in his campaign but he and Republicans leaders have repeatedly put them off with the argument that Congress had to focus on economic problems and could not afford a long and devisive debate on other matters But as part of a deal with Senator Helms to get the Voting Rights Act through the Senate Mr Baker promised conservatives a chance to attach their pet proposals to the debt ceiling bill Once the issue reached the Senate floor the President was forced to make good on his campaign statements In their continuing arguments against the Helms proposals leaders of the filibuster stressed today that their main concern was not the merits of abortion or school prayer but the independence of the judiciary The issue said Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican is who gets to interpret the Constitution the courts or the Congress Most analysts now believe that Mr Helms lacks the votes to end the filibuster But Senator Packwood filed almost 700 amendments to the debt ceiling bill today vowing to use every possible delaying tactic to bury the legislation until Congress adjourns
REAGAN NEUTRAL ON BID TO CURB COURT ON PRAYER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/09/us/reagan-neutral-on-bid-to-curb-court-on-prayer.html,The White House said today that President Reagan would not oppose a bill in Congress to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over school prayer cases despite the Justice Departments doubts that such an approach is constitutional Larry Speakes the deputy White House press secretary said the Administration would take no position on the bill which is sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican It would bar the Supreme Court from ruling on the constitutionality of school prayer The bill is an amendment to legislation raising the ceiling on the Federal debt Several Administration officials said Mr Reagans position on the Helms bill was not a change of Administration policy But one White House aide said it represented a shift in nuance aimed at pleasing disaffected conservatives upset with comments on school prayer made in May by Attorney General William French Smith Aim to Reassure Conservatives In his remarks Mr Smith said it was undesirable for Congress to make exceptions to Supreme Court jurisdiction in the core functions of the court as an independent and equal branch in our system of separation of powers In another move to reassure conservatives Mr Reagan urged lawmakers to support legislation now before the Senate that could sharply limit a womans right to an abortion Page A24 Mr Speakes in his briefing today acknowledged that the Justice Department had raised some questions about the constitutionality of the school prayer bill But he added We do not oppose the bill and said the question of constitutionality would be worked out in the courts Mr Speakess comments were seen by some in the Administration as a signal that Mr Reagan was prepared to sign the Helms legislation An aide to Mr Reagan said that embracing the reservations expressed by the Attorney General and thus infuriating conservative groups would be politically impossible The White Houses statement on school prayer was part of a series of statements issued by Mr Reagan about foreign policy and budget matters on his first full day at the White House after a vacation of more than two weeks in California Much of the Presidents attention was focused today on the budget and the economy as well as on the abortion and school prayer issues all of which are to be faced by a Congress returning from its August recess This afternoon Mr Reagan met with his senior economic advisory panel consisting largely of economists and businessmen A participant said Mr Reagan was given a preview of the budget picture for the 1984 fiscal year and listened to a discussion of the turbulent international economy Mr Reagan also appealed to Congress to sustain his veto of a supplemental appropriations bill that had provided 141 billion to operate the Government until Sept 30 The Congress must shoulder its responsibility sustain the veto and return to me a spending bill within our budget if we are to continue bringing down inflation and lowering interest rates Mr Reagan said Prediction Veto Will Hold Mr Reagan reiterated his regret at rejecting a bill that contained funds for certain Federal payrolls his aid package for the Caribbean region and emergency relief for Lebanon But he said the bill was nearly 1 billion over budget for other domestic programs He has also objected to the bills provisions cutting 21 billion in military spending from the amount he had requested White House aides and Administration allies in Congress are predicting with some confidence that Mr Reagans veto will be sustained A twothirds vote in both houses of Congress is required for a veto to be overridden Mr Reagan sent a letter to nine Senators today endorsing Mr Helmss antiabortion measure as a responsible statutory approach to one of the most sensitive problems our society faces the taking of the life of an unborn child The White House released the letters text but refused to identify the nine Senators Like the school prayer measure Mr Helmss antiabortion bill is an amendment to debtceiling legislation Senate action has been blocked by a filibuster by Senators opposed to Mr Helmss legislation and Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader is calling for debate to be cut off on the abortion issue so that other business can be taken up The effort to halt debate known as cloture requires a vote of 60 Senators In his letter to the Senators Mr Reagan asked for support for the cloture petition saying it was time to stand and be counted on this issue But he said his appeal for support of the Helms bill did not mean that he opposed a separate approach advanced by Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican for a full Constitutional amendment allowing states to outlaw abortions Mr Helmss measure contains language defining human life as beginning at conception Mr Reagan said in his letter that the Helms language would provide opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider its usurpation of the role of legislatures and State courts in this area On school prayer Mr Reagan is also faced with choosing between separate approaches aimed at legalizing something that the Supreme Court outlawed In a series of decisions more than a decade ago the court ruled that Governmentsponsored prayer in schools was unconstitutional Favors Constitutional Amendment White House officials said today that Mr Reagan while remaining neutral on Mr Helmss approach favored a Constitutional amendment permitting such prayer They said the President planned to support such an amendment Thursday in a speech on social values on a trip to Kansas Constitutional amendments require approval of twothirds of each house of Congress and subsequent approval of 38 state legislatures making them much more difficult to enact into law than an amendment to a bill such as Mr Helmss The only previously stated Administration position on permitting Governmentsponsored prayer by statute was the one enunciated by Mr Smith in May Since then Mr Reagan has faced rising criticism from conservative groups that he was not doing enough to support their views on abortion school prayer and other social issues Mr Smith never flatly declared that stripping the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over school prayer was unconstitutional But an Administration official admitted today that someone reading his statement would conclude that such an approach was in fact unconstitutional This official said it would be politically impossible for Mr Reagan to oppose Senator Helmss school prayer measure especially if it becomes tied up with the antiabortion measure and both are attached to the debtceiling legislation With all those issues that legislation would be Motherhood and Apple Pie to this Administration said an official

FOES OF ABORTION LOSE SENATE FIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/10/us/foes-of-abortion-lose-senate-fight.html,A day after President Reagan strongly endorsed antiabortion legislation now before Congress forces opposing the bill decisively won a key test vote in the Senate and said they believed the measure would not pass in this session The legislation which is aimed at reversing the Supreme Court decision nine years ago that legalized abortion has been subject to a filibuster by Senate liberals since last month Today the bills sponsors tried to cut off debate by invoking cloture but they failed badly Cloture requires 60 votes but the proposal received only 41 votes Fortyseven Senators including 18 Republicans ignored Mr Reagans appeal of Wednesday and opposed cloture The only Senator from New York New Jersey or Connecticut to vote in favor of cloture was Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York Those who voted against cloture were Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey Nicholas Brady Republican of New Jersey Christopher J Dodd Democrat of Connecticut and Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut Another cloture vote will be taken next Monday Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican who is the main sponsor of the abortion bill said he could count on at least 10 more votes and he vowed to continue the battle next week But with time running short in the Congressional session the prospects for his cause seem increasingly gloomy Termed a Reflection on Helms After the vote today John Shattuck director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union said This is really a resounding indication that the Senate doesnt like the way that Jesse Helms is doing business on this issue The Helms bill would ban all Federal financing for abortions previous legislation has banned it only on a yeartoyear basis The Helms bill would also assert that the Supreme Court erred in 1973 when it legalized abortion and would encourage further legal challenges to that decision Mr Helms has also offered an amendment reversing Supreme Court decisions banning officially sponsored prayer in public schools but that rider was not the subject of the cloture vote today Both amendments have been offered to a bill that would raise the national debt ceiling which must pass by the end of the month if the Government is not to run out of authority to borrow money The feeling on Capitol Hill today was that if the Helms camp lost one or two more cloture votes the Senate leadership would have to step in and offer a bill without the encumbering amendments The problem is that Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader has been promising conservatives for more than a year that they would have a full and fair and freestanding debate on abortion and other social issues And to maintain harmony with his own rightwing troops he cannot move too fast to end the debate Moderates Are Dismayed Republican moderates were dismayed Wednesday when Mr Reagan bowed to conservative pressure and publicly proclaimed his support of the bills to curb abortion and to legalize school prayer Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee called the Presidents statement one more nail in the coffin of the Republican Party He said Mr Reagan had been listening to advisers who are convinced that America doesnt want equal rights for women or minorities I dont think the President agrees with their philosophy but he listens to their conclusions Mr Packwood said Opponents of the Helms bills have been arguing that the real issue at stake is the integrity of the Supreme Court and that point clearly helped them win over votes today

IN THE NATION; REAGAN'S APPLE PIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/10/opinion/in-the-nation-reagan-s-apple-pie.html,The leaves are turning early this year in the White River Valley and on the slopes of the Green Mountains Brandon Gap elevation 2170 feet is already a harbinger of autumn with beginning shades of red and gold glowing richly against summers fading green Children are going back to school too in this most tranquil of states lining up cheerfully by the roadside to wait for the buses that have long been commonplace here This new growth of children the annual recycling of the generations as well as the turning of the leaves  in the beauty and timelessness of both  make fall the true season of renewal They also suggest how much nonsense the world more commonly works itself up about  the 1982 elections for example which are being waged here as everywhere else In Tuesdays primaries Vermont has a Republican candidate for the United States Senate Thomas McGregor a pharmacist who has confided to The White River Valley Herald that his decision to run was impelled by God who he said appeared to Mrs McGregor in a dream With such an endorsement as that Mr McGregor naturally opposes abortion and sex education gun control and secular humanism while favoring prayer in the schools and a strong military buildup That puts him right in the footsteps of President Reagan Mr Reagan while claiming no heavenly backing did his part for family values this week by strongly endorsing Senator Jesse Helmss antiabortion proposal and offering no opposition to the same Mr Helmss plan to bring prayer back to the public schools by emasculating the Supreme Court In both cases a President even one who shared Mr Helmss attitudes  who respected constitutional precedent orderly procedure and the equality of citizens would have insisted instead on a constitutional amendment Mr Reagan was apparently willing to put such conservative principles aside because as an unnamed White House official put it to Steve Weisman of The New York Times issues like abortion and prayer in the schools are motherhood and apple pie to this Administration Translated that means that with an election coming up the President is trying to please the radical right his base of support by showing that hes one of them  that Ronald Reagan is still a Reaganite In the one case the President of all the people urged senators to support the Helms proposal that Federal funds may never be used to pay for an abortion unless the life of the mother is at stake  not even for example in the case of a rape or incest victim or a woman too young to provide adequate care for a child This is not only senseless public policy  particularly for people like Mr Reagan and Mr Helms who bitterly resent welfare mothers Its also patently inequitable leaving women able to pay for an abortion free to have one while decreeing that those too poor to pay either have to bear unwanted children or have the job done by a coathanger artist in a back alley A constitutional amendment on the other hand would at least impose a uniform rule on rich and poor alike and would have the virtue if passed of demonstrated national approval And it would openly repeal rather than deviously undercut a constitutionally reached Supreme Court decision Mr Reagans political grab on the Helms prayer bill is even more opportunistic and less principled since his own Attorney General has already cited the plan as an undesirable attack on the Supreme Court more eminent legal scholars  for example Robert Bork Mr Reagans appointee to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals  called it unconstitutional The Helms proposal  like his antiabortion plan a rider on a debtlimit measure  would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in school prayer cases Therefore the Court could not enforce its 1963 ruling that such prayers are unconstitutional and a hodgepodge of state laws making prayers in school legal here but illegal there legal in some forms but not in others would be bound to result Even worse the Helms plan would effectively amend the Constitution by majority vote of Congress rather than by the votes of twothirds of each House and threequarters of the states Mr Reagan is supporting a constitutional amendment on the prayer issue but his statement made clear that he would sign the Helms courtstripping bill despite the Attorney Generals opinion despite its probable unconstitutionality and despite the radical precedents it would set for gutting the Supreme Courts authority and amending the Constitution So praise be for the children going back to school and the leaves turning in Brandon Gap Some things endure even if nonsense prevails
PRESIDENT CITES PROGRESS ON ECONOMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/10/us/president-cites-progress-on-economy.html,President Reagan began his fall campaign travels today with a speech that prominently touched the issues of school prayer and abortion and claimed progress in ending the nations long and terrible night of economic troubles Yes recovery has been sighted the President contended setting a theme for what will be a busy series of campaign visits in behalf of Republican candidates concerned at being judged in the November elections on the basis of the continuing recession In the last 19 months a coalition of Republicans and Democrats has begun to rein in a Government careening out of control pushing us toward economic collapse and quite probably the end of our way of life Mr Reagan declared Patriotic Themes Delivering the Alfred M Landon lecture at Kansas State University here the President condemned what he called doom criers in the nation and wielded some of his most patriotic language yet in asserting progress was being made on the economy Yes we face some awesome problems Mr Reagan said with a determined bob of his head but be proud of the red white and blue and believe in her mission Several thousand Kansans roared their approval as the band struck up Hail to the Chief and Mr Reagan arrived at Ahearn Fieldhouse arminarm with the Republicans stately patriarch Alf Landon the former Governor and Kansas Coolidge who lost to Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1936 Presidential election Mr Reagan praised Mr Landon as wise effective and revered Mr Landons daughter Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas beamed Outside the hall perhaps 100 students picketed variously protesting the Presidents policies on military spending the Middle East and nuclear disarmament Inside there was only one interruption a friendly shout of Atta boy Ron Abortion and Prayer Issues Mr Reagan spoke here on his way to visit Western Republican leaders and to raise money for candidates and to campaign tomorrow for Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is seeking reelection This is one of the races being watched as a possible measure of the electorates mood toward the Administration The Presidents sevenpage Landon lecture sketched some of his fall campaign strategy It highlighted such selective economic factors as the drop in inflation and prime interest rates and emphasized some of the issues conservative Republicans prefer to run on abortion school prayer and the proposed amendment for a balanced Federal budget Hailing God Moses and the Ten Commandments Mr Reagan declared The time has come for this Congress to give a majority of American families what they want for their children a constitutional amendment that will make it unequivocally clear that children can hold voluntary prayer in their schools He followed this with an endorsement of the antiabortion campaign currently under way in the Senate Noting that this debate focused in part on the uncertainty of when life begins the President added I just happen to believe simple morality dictates that unless and until someone can prove the unborn is not alive we must give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is No Harsh Political Labels The address was devoid of harshly partisan language Indeed Mr Reagan renounced tired old political labels Sometimes in the world of politics he said it seems that our dialogue hasnt gone much beyond Me Tarzan you Jane  Later at a state Republican fundraising event Mr Reagan chose farmyard not jungle metaphor in pleading for time and tolerance You cant go in and instantly clean out the stable and change things that have been piling up for as many years as they have he said As the audience laughed Mr Reagan added I suppose I could have reworded that In the Landon lecture Mr Reagan who recently needed the help of House Democrats in winning a tax increase portrayed a twoparty coalition as having begun to set things right The unstated corollary was that by sharing a bit of the credit the Democrats might share as well in whatever voter criticism is out here BudgetBalancing Amendment But the President also accused the House Democratic leaders of bottling up the budgetbalancing amendment a proposal that politicians in both parties privately concede is an electionyear nostrum in the face of the ballooning Federal deficit Mr Reagan denied a central criticism from this years Democratic campaigners To charge that our Administration is trying to reduce inflation on the backs of the unemployed is to stand truth on its head he said Rather he saw unemployment as the effect of longterm inflation and interest pressures and he emphasized as historically the last factor to turn around after a recession Mr Reagan threaded a series of such defensive points on specific issues through an overall exuberant theme of patriotism praise of the American people and renewed belief in our ability to perform great deeds Hailing the sight of the Kansans as a tonic to his Washingtonweary soul Mr Reagan urged the nation to reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline the world sliding to disaster no matter what we do
"CONCERNING KUDZU, POLITICS AND AN INJURED THUMB; The Talk of Atlanta",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/11/us/concerning-kudzu-politics-and-an-injured-thumb-the-talk-of-atlanta.html,Much of the summer conversation in this capital of the South can be dominated by tales of woe about kudzu and mildew Kudzu is a vine that tends to embrace everything it touches and never lets go without a fight Mildew of course stains everything from basement to roof When the summertime enemies begin to retreat for the winter the conversation shifts to other matters This year there are more topics than usual Politically Georgia is bracing for the first governorship race in more than a decade in which the contenders appear to have little concern for the thinking of the liberals and moderates of the New South In November voters will choose between two conservatives Joe Frank Harris the Democrat and Bob Bell the Republican Mr Harris a longtime State Representative surprised party members when he won second place in the primary forcing a runoff Aug 31 with the frontrunner Bo Ginn a fiveterm Congressman And the more Mr Harris stressed such issues as school prayer and abortion the more Mr Ginn fell behind losing the runoff Mr Bell a conservative who beat a stauncher conservative Ben Blackburn in the Republican primary has not yet let on to much of his thinking save for a tough position on crime If Mr Harriss victory was a surprise so was the decision by State Representative Julian Bond not to run for Congress Mr Bond a civil rights worker in the 1960s had all but declared himself a candidate for the seat in the redrawn and substantially black Fifth Congressional District which he helped create by wrestling with state lawmakers In retreating this year he acknowledged the difficulty of putting together a financial war chest in a matter of weeks and of staging an effective campaign against the incumbent Wyche Fowler Jr a white liberal Democrat whose opponent in the coming primary is not considered formidable There is talk of a deal between Mr Bond and Mr Fowler but if one exists no one who knows is talking Atlantans are also trying to sort out their loyalties in the sports world Is it more important to worry about how Herschel Walkers injured thumb is doing and thus gain insight into the prospects this football season for the University of Georgias Bulldogs Or should the promising prospects of the Atlanta Braves to win the National League pennant be paid more attention than has been the case in recent days At times it appears that the Braves dont have a chance against the thumb Mr Walker Georgias star running back injured the thumb in practice last month causing a near nervous breakdown in much of this college footballcrazed state It happened about the time the Braves were in a slump Since then the thumb has dominated sports news while the Braves have had a tough time recapturing attention even though they once again lead the Western Division In Athens this week the University of Georgia had no problem packing its stadium with 82000 people for its victorious opening game against Clemson And Mr Walker kept everyone in suspense until he showed up and played part of the game But at the Fulton County Stadium where the Braves played host to the world champion Los Angeles Dodgers this week in a battle for first place the stands were half filled Some Atlantans feel the city needs all the victories it can get Tough economic realities are beginning to set in and the old technique of depicting endless prosperity and opportunity is beginning to falter The GeorgiaPacific Corporation the giant maufacturer of forest products is literally raising the horizons of the skyline with its move back to Georgia from Oregon and its occupation of a new 52story office building in downtown But in its shadow small businesses are closing by the dozens the National Bank of Georgia is moving to the suburbs and offices stand empty throughout the city and suburbs Many realty agents are offering free space to tenants and one company is offering its sales agents a Mercedes Benz for the most space leased General Motors stunned the city a few days ago by mothballing its Lakewood plant idling 1700 workers and slow airline traffic at the new Hartsfield terminal has prompted several businesses there to close Remember Underground Atlanta the celebrated strip at an old downtown railroad site It was the center of nightlife in the 1960s but it has been closed for several months much to the embarrassment of downtown business barons And a recent study commissioned by civic leaders said the principal complaint of visitors was that they had no place to hold a party here A group calling itself InTown Inc has come up with a temporary solution It is staging a party tonight and Saturday downtown underground It is in the new subway station at Peachtree Center one of two stations that Marta the regional transit authority will open on Saturday Marta is racing against a Washington cutoff of mass transit funds trying to finish an ambitious rapid transit system that is to sweep from the airport on the south to Doraville on the north So far despite the ambitious construction program Marta appears to be losing the battle The Peachtree Center party with live music a scavenger hunt dancers and exhibits at the public library is not just marking the opening of a subway station said Pam Rosen a publicist for the event The 15aperson event she said is a cause for celebration It will bring people downtown she went on And such events are expected to slow down if only for a few hours the lateafternoon race out of downtown that puts nighttime central Atlanta at one with many Northern cities that it emulates

DEFIANT REAGAN PROMISES TO GIVE MORE PRACTICE ON VETOES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/11/us/defiant-reagan-promises-to-give-more-practice-on-vetoes.html,President Reagan responded to his defeat on a budget veto today by warning members of Congress that they would have a lot more chances because Im going to do a lot more vetoing Mr Reagan conceded his disappointment at the reversal after 20 months of victories in Congress but he denied that he was losing his touch No I dont think so he said I wasnt aiming for a scoreless game Well see the next time out The Presidents vow of further vetoes drew applause from a large friendly crowd gathered at a Republican picnic here in this flat rural community near the Wasatch Mountains The crowd uttered a collective Oooh at his announcement that he had fallen one vote short in the Senate But I want to tell you something Mr Reagan said with a tight nod of avowal They better practice at that because theyre going to get a chance to do that every time they send an appropriation down that is over the budget Ill veto it Cheers for the President The crowd drenched after hours of waiting at the rainsoaked picnic grounds cheered the Presidents declaration as he stood on a farm wagon decorated with bales of hay and a red saddle Waving and smiling Mr Reagan seemed to find comfort for his defeat in the hundreds of families who gathered from distant parts of this state which in 1980 gave Mr Reagan the largest margin of victory of any state 72 percent The President tried to work the bad news from Washington into a quip after local sheriffs swore him in as an honorary deputy Maybe I can stop some of the highway robbery going on in Washington he declared The news of the vote was relayed to the President not long after he finished a lastditch round of personal pleas by telephone to get senators to stand by him on the veto In the middle of a trip here to campaign for Congressional candidates he talked to 10 senators Thursday night and reached at least seven more this morning before they headed for the chamber and the vote that overrode his veto of a 141 billion supplemental spending bill The trip demonstrated the difficulty of trying to juggle electionyear campaigning and budgetary skirmishing as the traveling White House worked feverishly to shore up its Senate majority while proceeding through the rainy gloomy day in Utah The politician who was to have gone arm in arm with Mr Reagan to the picnic here Senator Orrin G Hatch instead hurried back to Washington at the Presidents request for the Senate vote Mr Hatch departed Thursday night stopping first to inform reporters that he would gladly vote with the President even though he had originally voted in favor of the bill that Mr Reagan vetoed The Senator sitting patiently by a potted palm in the lobby of the Presidential partys hotel as a local television crew interviewed him insisted that the public would not be confused by all the swiveling plans and votes A Much Bigger Issue My vote is to support the President Mr Hatch declared The issue he is fighting for is a much bigger issue than the supplemental The issue is Are we going to get the Congress to live within its means Even so Mr Hatch made a point of emphasizing that he was in favor of one politically sensitive program in the supplemental spending bill Federal aid for jobs for the elderly Addressing the crowd here Mr Reagan did not linger much on the veto defeat Instead he went through his list of campaign issues including school prayer abortion aid to private schools and what he says are signs that the recession is coming to an end But the veto did seem to influence the tone of his standard speech in that he revived some of the language of his 1980 Presidential campaign accusing the Democrats of decades of inflationary policies In particular he denied charges that he was unfriendly to poor people What do they think their inflation has done to the poor over 30 years he asked Attacks Government Bureaucracy Earlier in the day Mr Reagan visited the Mormon cannery here a churchrun factory that cans free food for poor people who agree to do voluntary work He commented favorably on the cannery which was founded in 1936 in part as a repudiation of Government welfare programs instituted by Franklin D Roosevelt Hailing the effort Mr Reagan said the factory was being operated with virtually no bureaucracy as compared to Governments attempt to do this As the traveling White House retreated through the gray day to Washington Hooper again cheered Mr Reagan was originally expected to visit the area last Tuesday and while local politicians were notified of the change in plans the people were not So scores of families arrived here in their Sunday best three days early according to Jewel Widison a retired teacher who writes a column Just In Hooper for The Hooper Community News Miss Widison who doubled as a columnist and musician today in serenading Mr Reagan as a member of the Hooper Hometown Players indicated that the Presidents visit was one of the busiest events here since the local dance hall burned down in 1952
BENEATH THE VETO UPSET WERE DEEPER DISCONTENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/12/weekinreview/beneath-the-veto-upset-were-deeper-discontents.html,WASHINGTON TONY Coelho might have been the only gloomy Democrat in Washington last week The California Representative is head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and as the House was voting Thursday on whether to sustain President Reagans veto of a 141 billion spending bill Mr Coelho had his computers and copying machines humming He could not wait to start attacking the Republicans who supported the President voting against funds to help the elderly and the handicapped To the surprise of many insiders the House voted to override the veto 301 to 117 The 81 Republicans who opposed the President included most of those facing tough races this fall The same day the Senate ignored a personal appeal from Mr Reagan refusing to halt a filibuster against legislation that could severely restrict a womans right to abortion On Friday the Senate rounded off the Reagan Presidencys roughest week on Capitol Hill by overriding the spendingbill veto too Only two Republican Senators facing reelection backed the President It is too early to say that the Congressional coalition that gave Mr Reagan a long string of victories during his first 18 months has finally crumbled Public opinion polls show many agree with his goals of smaller government and lower taxes and as Senator Bob Dole warned the Senate Mr Reagans campaign swing through the West last week demonstrated his strong personal appeal But the weeks events certainly indicated that Mr Reagan had lost some of his clout Republican legislators were obviously not deserting him in droves because they were eager to wrap themselves in the Reagan economic record or to push for a program that is causing domestic hardships while sharply increasing military spending In an important sense both wounds the President suffered last week were selfinflicted In both cases Mr Reagan apparently decided to propitiate his more extreme supporters those Republicans who believe as Senator Bob Packwood put it last week that the best way to build a political party is to purify it by driving out evil spirits In the process the White House ignored the basic truth about American politics that the Democrats brushed aside when they nominated Senator George McGovern for the Presidency in 1972 Effective coalitions are almost always built in the middle of the political spectrum and fringe groups seldom win elections The President acted as if he believed his own press clippings that he was a legislative Superman who could leap tall opponents in a single bound But he discovered that his mandate was not inexhaustible During the fight over his tax increase last month Mr Reagan succeeded precisely because he ignored rightwing pressures and took an ideologically unpalatable but pragmatic course designed to raise revenues and reduce the Federal deficit As a result he was able to win the support of Democrats who provided his margin of victory A Backfire on Purity But that angered his conservative supporters who demanded a return to purity and apparently Mr Reagan felt compelled to refurbish his image The White House had been sidetracking the social issue agenda for 18 months while Mr Reagan focused on the economy The decision to shift gears appalled Republican moderates For the President to use up chits on these issues said Senator Packwood an Oregon Republican when hes got so many other pressing issues is discouraging The right wing is pushing so hard out of desperation They know that the 1980 election was probably their highwater mark and they want to take advantage of their current strength But their positions particularly on abortion do not represent a consensus The economic issue is more subtle a closer call for many lawmakers In his direct lobbying sessions with swing senators Mr Reagan argued strenuously that if his veto was not upheld he would lose face and his ability to pursue his program The argument made sense to Senator Dole who asserted that the real question was not whether the bill busted the budget but whether a defeat would bust the President That of course may not be known even through the showdowns that emerge in the next few weeks over 1983 appropriations for which no bills have yet been passed Another question is whether the President will be able to turn his defeat to political advantage by stepping up his argue that his opponents are really the same old Washington big spenders But last week on the 1982 budget measure as in the case of the social issues Mr Reagan had chosen to fight on the wrong battleground Senator John H Chafee of Rhode Island reported that in the Republican cloakroom there was a feeling that he was illadvised that he shouldnt have gotten out on a limb on this one For one thing Congress clearly felt that it had been pushed around too long by Mr Reagan and by his budget director David A Stockman The anger of Republicans and Democrats at the veto of a hardwrought Congressional compromise should not be underestimated More seriously even Reagan loyalists feared that the President did not understand the limits of his powers or his policies They might have written him a check in the last election but it was not a blank check Finally there is a sharp feeling particularly among Frost Belt legislators that the White House underestimates the human suffering and political danger its policies have caused The concern was embodied in a story that Senator Alfonse DAmato who broke with the President on the override vote told Mr Reagan about Louis Zaccaria an 85yearold man who spoke to the Senator at a town meeting in Rochester early in the week Mr Zaccaria urged Mr DAmato to oppose the veto on the simple ground that too much money was going for defense and not enough to the legitimate needs of the elderly and the poor He was a believer Mr DAmato said of Mr Zaccaria He wasnt a rabblerouser He was an honest patriot who appreciates the country The Republicans who defied Mr Reagan last week were afraid that the President has forgotten Louis Zaccaria and did not understand his impatience
RECESSION MAKES TEXAS CAMPAIGN JUST LIKE POLITICS EVERYWHERE ELSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/us/recession-makes-texas-campaign-just-like-politics-everywhere-else.html,No longer insulated by oil money and growth Texas politics sounds less exotic this fall Just like campaigns everywhere else it is focused on the recession To Republicans the glass is half full for unemployment at 67 percent is lower than in any other large state Gov William P Clements Jr insists that Texas is proving itself recessionresistant and that the recession hit Texas least and the recession is leaving Texas quickest To Democrats the glass is half empty for the 67 percent unemployment rate is higher than anyone here remembers except for those who experienced the Depression Attorney General Mark White the Democratic candidate for Governor sees political opportunity in the approach of Governor Clements And state Democrats in their party platform say that approach embodies callousness shortsightedness and morally bankrupt leadership Good Medicine or Bad Half full or half empty is a political argument heard in most of the country Republicans argue that the Administration is offering tough but necessary medicine and that the recession is one unhappy byproduct Democrats say it is just bad medicine as former Vice President Walter F Mondale charged here Saturday at the Democrats convention But in Texas politics the argument is new This recession unlike recent ones has dented the economy of the third most populous state and broadened the political argument from traditional concerns such as oil and immigrants How the issue will affect the election results is not clear V Lance Tarrance Jr the Governors polltaker thinks Texans are still confident I honestly dont believe the economy thus far has had any material impact on this campaign he said People generally dont hold a governor responsible for economic ills that are national in origin But Ernest Angelo of Midland a Republican national committeeman warns The potential is there for it to make a difference Its fair game Mr White thinks he can make this recession stick to Mr Clements an avid supporter of President Reagan who raised 35 million for the Governor at a single event this summer The Democratic candidate charges that Mr Clements thinks 500000 Texans being out of work isnt all that significant Some Familiar Elements Although the national economy is a new element in the state campaign some familiar elements remain At the Republicans state convention in Austin this weekend attacks on liberals and organized labor were continual and the main internal dispute was over opposition to abortion with advocates of absolute prohibition losing And for some Democrats calling the Republicans ideologues is still irresistible Jim Hightower the partys nominee for Commissioner of Agriculture said at the convention Friday Its going to be more fun running against these little rightwing Republicans than choking chickens The recession has already had one political result Along with the sober realization after the 1978 and 1980 elections that Texas Republicans were a lasting political force the recession has served to unite Democrats here One Democratic candidate after another hit at the same theme Friday night Ann Richards the candidate for state treasurer who with Mr Hightower holds down the liberal end of the slate said Weve been shoveling our way through a smokescreen to discover that our Republican friends are passing out BandAids to put on a slit throat Yellow Dog Ate Popcorn United States Representative Jim Mattox the Democratic candidate for Attorney General said Mr Reagan and Mr Clements followed the old Republican policy that if you got a little inflation the way to solve that is you put all the working folks out of work He campaigned with a yellow dog by his side to symbolize the hope of more straightticket Democratic voting this fall In Texas such voters are called yellowdog Democrats because they are said to be willing to vote for any Democratic candidate at all even a yellow dog The dog ate popcorn as Mr Mattox spoke This Democratic unity also appears as an opportunity to Republicans With a huge advantage in campaign funds they seek to portray all the Democratic candidates including Mr White and Senator Lloyd Bentsen as liberals That array of liberal Democrats are going to strangle the goose that laid the golden egg if elected Senator John Tower said in Austin Friday Labor Endorsement Assailed The Democratic ticket has been endorsed with enthusiasm more than any other in history by the bosses of organized labor said Mr Angelo Governor Clements while calling his challenger some incompetent lawyer whose name I cant seem to remember concentrated on a defense of the states economy Texas will lead the national economic recovery he predicted In fact were already doing soUnemployment declined in Texas the last two months In fact in the month of August six out of 10 jobs created in America were created right here in Texas
Washington Watch; Capital Gains Setback Seen,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/washington-watch-capital-gains-setback-seen.html,WASHINGTON WALL STREETS last hope for 1982 legislation to shorten the holding period for longterm capital gains to six months from one year may fall victim to Senator Jesse Helmss antiabortion and school prayer bills The North Carolina Republican is attempting to attach both to the resolution to raise the national debt ceiling Senator Bob Dole Republican of Kansas has promised to use that resolution as a vehicle to reduce the capital gains holding period With either Helms measure the debt resolution would bog down in the House and the Treasury needs passage by Sept30 so that it can keep borrowing to finance the budget deficit To prevent a fiscal crisis the Administration and the Senate leadership are talking about a recommittal motion on the Senate floor that would strip all riders from the debt ceiling legislation Wall Street had expected approval of the sixmonth holding period in the August tax bill But Mr Dole surrendered that item in conference with the House when Representative Dan Rostenkowski the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee would not accept it even after Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan  who promised the sixmonth amendment to his old friends in Wall Street telephoned the conferees to plead for it Maybe next year Aides say Mr Regan feels committed and will resume the fight in 1983 if necessary DomesticContent Auto Bill Even though Representative Richard Ottinger Democrat of Westchester has softened his domesticcontent auto bill it still faces an uncertain future in the House  despite some help from friends in the leadership The Committee on Energy and Commerce failed to complete work on the bill last week but will resume consideration Wednesday Meanwhile House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts is reportedly urging Representative Rostenkowski to expedite work on the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee so that it can reach the floor soon Opponents of the bill see Ways and Means which gets custody of the bill after Energy and Commerce as the only hope to avoid passage The amended bill would require that domestic content  such as the work of American laborers and parts fashioned here  be based on the size of an auto makers annual sales and would become more restrictive annually between now and 1986 At full force in 1986 it would require that the content be only 10 percent for companies with sales of 100000 units or less and 90 percent for those that sell more than 900000 units Although the committees members on both sides of the party line want to be free traders it is hard in these preelection days to vote against a measure that the United Automobile Workers union says will save jobs At one point during a markup that went on intermittently all day last Thursday Representative Phil Gramm the economist and Democrat from Texas donned his professorial cap and lectured the members on the dangers of an international trade war if Congress enacts such protective legislation Trade protectionism has never worked for any former world trade leader he said What we need are more open markets not protection if we enact this bill we will destroy American industrial leadership A succession of members from both parties took issue however saying the bill was needed to put pressure on Europe and Japan Representative Philip R Sharp Democrat of Indiana near the middle of Americas growing auto dust bowl said there may be dangers but this bill may also be the weapon we need to open those markets Both the frustration and the likelihood that the House panel will pass the bill were reflected in a single vote By 26 to 13 the panel rejected an amendment that would allow President Reagan an opponent of the bill to suspend its provisions if they are later found to violate terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Bribery Charge Hearing John M Fedders chief of the Securities and Exchange Commissions enforcement division was the star witness at a closeddoor House hearing last week to discuss charges that a former client was involved in a possible scheme to bribe a state public official The hearings held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which is led by Representative John D Dingell Democrat of Michigan were called to examine Mr Fedders role as counsel for a company that reportedly made a 96000 bribe to a public official A Federal grand jury in Brooklyn is investigating the case but the identity of the company has by court order been kept secret The National Law Journal a New Yorkbased periodical has reported that the company is the Southland Corporation which owns the 7Eleven convenience stores So far there have not been any suggestions that Mr Fedders or his former law firm Washingtonbased Arnold  Porter were involved in the coverup or the illegal payments But because the matter is shrouded in such secrecy just what role he played in the case is as intriguing as it is unclear Mr Fedders refuses to discuss the matter Were not discussing anything at this point including what the subcommittee will do said Michael Barrett staff director of the subcommittee But we will say that Mr Fedders did assert the attorneyclient privilege on many of the questions asked
SENATE PRIMARY IN MINNESOTA DRAWS THE WELL-KNOWN AND WELL-FINANCED,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/us/senate-primary-in-minnesota-draws-the-well-known-and-well-financed.html,The most hotly contested race in the Minnesota primary Tuesday the fight for the Senate seat held by David Durenberger has drawn candidates ranging from a former Presidential candidate to a businessman whose campaign spending has already doubled the state record Voters will also choose nominees for Governor Congress and half a dozen state posts Candidates in the gubernatorial race include Harold Stassen 75 years old who has been elected Governor three times and who ran for President six times In the Senate race Mr Durenberger a Republican elected in 1978 to fill the unexpired term of the late Senator Hubert H Humphrey is seeking his first full sixyear term He has only marginal opposition within his party In the Democratic race the most noteworthy candidates are Eugene L McCarthy who unsuccessfully sought the Presidency in 1968 and Mark Dayton a Democrat who is associated with the Daytons Department Store and Rockefeller fortunes Mr McCarthys candidacy has failed to gain momentum and Mr Dayton has emerged as the frontrunner Spending Has Become Issue Mr Daytons spending has become a campaign issue So far he has expended 5 million and records filed by his campaign committee show he has provided all but about 175000 of his war chest Much of that money has been used for campaign consultants and television commercials aimed at increasing his name recognition By contrast Mr Durenberger has raised about 22 million and Mr McCarthy has raised about 26255 On other issues Mr Dayton has said he favors cutting imports of steel and natural iron ore by 50 percent for two to three years to help Minnesotas depressed steel taconite automobile and housing industries Mr McCarthy says such a move would subvert the nations trade agreements and would be tantamount to an act of war against Japan Instead he recommends a defense tax on imports to make American products more competitive Mr Durenberger has focused on a resolution of national purposes similar to President Reagans new federalism plan that he proposes to introduce next year It calls for shifting responsibility for education corrections job training transportation public health environmental protection and social services to state and local governments but continuing to give the Federal Government responsibility for protecting the financial security of the poor 6 in Gubernatorial Race The Governorship went up for grabs when Albert H Quie a Republican who began his term when the state had a multimilliondollar budget surplus announced that he would not seek reelection Minnesota now faces a record deficit The primary to succeed Governor Quie has drawn three Independent Republicans as the Republicans are officially known and three candidates of the DemocraticFarmerLabor Party The latter are Warren Spannaus the states Attorney General who received the partys endorsement former Governor Rudy Perpich and Ellsworth Peterson an aircraft mechanic The Republican contenders besides Mr Stassen are Lou Wangberg who began his campaign as the obscure Lieutenant Governor and has since gained his partys endorsement and Wheelock Whitney a businessman in health services The latter two are the frontrunners Mr Whitney has recommended a nogrowth state budget which Mr Wangberg has asserted would bring vital state services to a standstill In turn Mr Wangberg has proposed a limited growth budget and property tax freeze that Mr Whitney has described as too vague to be meaningful Mr Stassen has proposed replacing the worker compensation system with a nonprofit program run by the state rather than private insurers at what he says would be a 50 percent savings to employers Stands on Guns and Abortions On the Democratic side Mr Spannaus and Mr Perpich have campaigned as advocates of pistol control but differ on a Constitutional amendment restricting abortions with Mr Spannaus opposed and Mr Perpich in favor Mr Peterson has focused on reducing the state deficit projected to run 476 million for 198385 The states farm vote is expected to play a significant role in a number of contests In troubled economic times when the farm economy is depressed the DemocraticFarmerLabor Party has historically fared best The farm vote will be particularly significant in the Congressional contest in the agricultural Second District in southwestern Minnesota James Nichols is the leading DemocraticFarmerLabor candidate and Vin Weber is the Republican incumbent Mr Weber 30 may be hurt because he is not a farmer and as a Republican is associated by some with policies of the Reagan Administration that are unpopular among farmers Mr Nichols 36 a former teacher grows grain and raises beef cattle on 520 acres near the South Dakota border He faces an uphill fight because of a poorly financed campaign Another Congressional contest is in the new Sixth District Although each has opposition from within his party Arlen Erdahl an Independent Republican who currently represents the First District and Gerry Sikorski a DemocraticFarmerLabor candidate are expected to face each other in the November general elections
G.O.P. SENATE HOPEFULS IN A RACE FOR RECOGNITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/nyregion/gop-senate-hopefuls-in-a-race-for-recognition.html,With march music thundering from a tape recorder in the background Whitney North Seymour Jr solemnly shook hands with hundreds of commuters the other day as they bounded onto trains at the CrotonHarmon station in Westchester County But despite a flagbedecked van cheery red campaign balloons and a sign that said Meet Your Next US Senator many hurtled by without stopping And most of those who stopped did not know that Mr Seymour was one of three Republicans competing for the right to challenge the Democratic nominee in November It is a scene that the candidates  Assemblywoman Florence M Sullivan of Brooklyn Muriel Siebert a former State Banking Superintendent and Mr Seymour a former United States Attorney  say is repeated across the state as they seek to overcome their lack of voter recognition Difficulties of the Campaign As the campaign approaches the final days the candidates are lamenting the difficulty of getting their views  or even their names  across to the halfmillion or so registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary Sept 23 The name rang a bell but I didnt know if he was running for US Senate or the State Senate said Bill Coleman a producer of television commercials from Yorktown who was waiting on the station platform Im not from here Im from up in Putnam County said a man in pin stripes after receiving a crisp handshake and a tired Hi how are you from the candidate In her campaign advertisements Miss Siebert portrays herself as a woman who means business and has succeeded in a tough mans world Mr Seymour argues that as a twofisted trial lawyer and former State Senator he has broader experience than his opponents Miss Sullivan who will appear on the November ballot on the Conservative and Right to Life lines even if she does not win the primary portrays herself as a mother teacher prosecutor and legislator who is a conservative Reagan Republican But despite a summer of travel across the state visits to newspaper editorial boards tours of county fairs and news conferences called at the least opportunity surveys of voters show that the candidates remain virtually unknown The campaign has been overshadowed by the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor and by the probability that the GOP Senate nominee will face a formidable Democratic opponent in November Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who defeated his Republican opponent six years ago by 12 percentage points Mr Moynihan faces a challenge in the Democratic primary from Melvin Klenetsky a former leader of the US Labor Party but is expected to win easily All the people in the primary are the underdog Miss Siebert said of the GOP race because we havent come face to face yet with Mr Moynihan A large part of the problem is money Despite the Republican Partys reputation as a magnet for large contributors the candidates all complain that many traditional donors are staying away at least until the primary is over Short Arms and Deep Pockets They have short arms and deep pockets Mrs Sullivan said as she sat in a coffee shop on 86th Street in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn after campaigning on the street Everybody is having a hard time raising money Asked about fundraising Mr Seymour shook his tanned and balding head from side to side Its murder murder he said Youve got to have a lot of friends or former friends The wise guys are not out there And Miss Siebert who has given or lent her campaign 250000 is counting on a series of lastminute fundraising events Typically she said donors who had promised 1000 were sending checks for 350 instead Miss Siebert and Mr Seymour who have raised about 100000 so far from other people are planning mailings and modest television campaigns in the final days of the campaign Mrs Sullivan has raised less than half that amount and is hoping to raise enough for a mailing to the 563253 Republicans who voted in the partys 1980 Senate primary There are 24 million registered Republicans in the state Agreement on Most Issues The candidates agree on many issues especially their dissatisfaction with Mr Moynihan Each argues that the economy is the biggest issue of the day and that the Federal deficit must be reduced Each supports some form of the death penalty and says the criminaljustice system must be strengthened Mrs Sullivan is a 53yearold widow with three children who returned to college in her 30s and taught in a Roman Catholic high school She then went to law school was an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn and has been elected twice to the Legislature She hopes to win the primary by portraying her opponents as liberals who will split the same segment of the Republican vote She is the only candidate to oppose abortion on demand cuts in defense spending and recent tax increases enacted in Washington Her aides have closely studied the 1980 Republican Senate primary in which Alfonse M DAmato defeated Senator Jacob K Javits and Mrs Sullivan hopes to win over many of those who voted for Mr DAmato Mr Seymour who prefers to be called Mike is 59 years old and a longtime member of New York Citys political social and legal establishment In addition to his service as a United States Attorney and State Senator he has been president of the State Bar Association and is a partner in the law firm of Simpson Thacher  Bartlett He is the officially designated candidate of the states Republican Party and has been endorsed by nine of his former colleagues in the State Senate Mr Seymour says that during his summer campaign travels around the state he covered 10000 miles and shook 125000 hands But much of his campaigning was overshadowed by a stop at the Altamont Fair in Albany County where Mr Seymour was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for distributing campaign literature in the fairgrounds Mr Seymour said that at a hearing after the primary he would argue that the restriction on campaigning was unconstitutional Miss Siebert 53 was the first woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange the first to become a partner in a stock exchange firm and the first to be chairman of her own firm Called One Dimensional One of Miss Sieberts commercials shows her getting into a limousine and saying she will fight to make the government balance its books She has been accused by her opponents of being one dimensional The US economy is a lot more complicated than a bank Mr Seymour says  and she readily agrees Sure Im onedimensional she said But isnt the biggest problem in the country jobs unemployment interest rates the deficit of the country If thats onedimensional so be it Miss Siebert has also come under attack for a proposal to collect taxes from the underground economy  offthe books transactions in cash Mrs Sullivan has interpreted this to mean taxing illegal drug transactions Mr Seymour has criticized her for insisting that others pay their fair share while her 1981 tax returns show 18 tax shelters It impairs her credibility he said Miss Siebert says her tax returns were audited several times and the shelters were found legal and ethical She is concerned that voters will confuse her with Mrs Sullivan because their names are similar but she believes that she has an edge because both of her opponents are lawyers Thats the problem with Washington There are too many attorneys she said If I need an attorney I can hire one

REAGAN HARKS BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/us/reagan-harks-back-to-the-campaign.html,By tradition the political season starts the week after Labor Day so it was fitting that President Reagan chose this time to return to the homey issues and upbeat style of his 1980 campaign At that time Mr Reagan was the goodnews Presidential candidate He assured voters that there were simple commonsense solutions to problems that according to bureaucrats social scientists environmentalists and traditional economists were so complex as to be insoluble In the social arena for example Mr Reagan called for returning prayer to the schoolroom and passing stronger laws against abortion busing and violent crime Almost exactly two years ago in language heavy with patriotic and religious references he spoke of such steps as part of a Government based on the values of family work neighborhood peace and freedom Postelection analyses showed that Mr Reagans emphasis on this community of values was an important part of the glue that held together his disparate coalition It included Protestant fundamentalists ethnic Catholics private school parents antiabortion activists and a mixed constituency of working and middleclass voters who had little in common politically except their agreement with Mr Reagan that the nation was threatened by a decline in moral and spiritual values Our TimeTested Values As President Mr Reagan muted his patrioticreligious appeals But his speech at Kansas State University last Thursday suggests that when Mr Reagan takes to the road in behalf of his partys Congressional candidates in the next couple of months audiences will once again see the Reagan of 1980 a stump speaker who is a blunt advocate of New Right stands on social issues We must restore to their place of honor the bedrock values handed down by families to serve as societys compass Mr Reagan said in Manhattan Kan Our timetested values have never failed us when weve had the courage to live up to them White House political strategists have said that between now and the election Mr Reagan plans a number of steps to reestablish his ties to the socialissue constituency This is billed as an attempt to offset conservative dismay at Mr Reagans advocacy of last months 983 billion tax increase but it is more than that It also signals a belated understanding among senior Reagan advisers of the true nature of the Reagan constituency For almost 20 months now the White House has behaved as if the Reagan coalition was one held together by economic philosophy The record suggests otherwise however The fascination with Mr Reagans adoption modification and nearrenunciation of supplyside economics is not shared by his national constituency Instead a Republican strategist observed Reagan supporters are interested in a broad range of consensus issues These include cutting taxes and spending to be sure but they also include school prayer busing and law and order The Issue of Choice The dominance of the economic issue was dictated by events to some extent But it was also the issue of choice among top Reagan aides for reasons of political philosophy and social class Senior White House advisers have never made a secret of their belief that the social issues were peripheral Although Mr Reagan campaigned as a nonEstablishment Republican most of these advisers either have Establishment roots or are Californians of a certain sophistication Socially they never felt comfortable with the teetotaling preachers of the religious right or the ideologues of the New Right Morever many top White House aides perhaps most of them have reservations about Mr Reagans stand on abortion the most divisive of the social issues This of course has led to distrust of the Reagan White House on the right It also leaves the President open to the charge from the right that he has turned back to the social issues in a desperate effort to divert attention from the economy But on the abortion issue at least Mr Reagan can argue that he is placing conviction ahead of the poll figures They show that his opposition to freedom of choice is not popular among traditional whitecollar Republicans who are after all an important element of his constituency too If you go too far in that direction you break up other elements of your coalition a Republican strategist said of the abortion issue The prayer stuff he quipped is heaven sent Its a consensus thing Change on School Prayer Mr Reagans renewed advocacy of school prayer at the opening of the Congressional campaign illustrates another aspect of his behavior as candidate In 1980 Mr Reagan never had time for complicating details He dismissed environmental arguments for example in advancing his view that the energy crisis could be solved simply by drilling more oil wells In similar fashion Mr Reagan brushed aside opposing arguments as he kicked off the political season by withdrawing Administration opposition to Senator Jesse Helmss bill to bar the Supreme Court from ruling on the constitutionality of school prayer In this case of course the opposing arguments came from Mr Reagans own Department of Justice which has consistently warned the White House that such an approach would in itself violate the Constitution Mr Reagan erased any doubt that he plans a socialissue offensive when he embraced the Helms measure on the same day that he urged Republican Senators to vote for legislation limiting the right to abortion These two political moves furnished a reminder of another Presidential talent that has not been much on view since the 1980 campaign Mr Reagan has a talent for cloaking these divisive issues in patriotic terms that link them to the mythic American past Thus the Presidents new stump speeches echo those of 1980 in equating opposition to school prayer with attempting to expel God the very source of our knowledge from our childrens classrooms Candidate Reagan became President Reagan largely because of his skill at stump oratory By following the aggressive pattern he set last week he can provide a clear test of whether White House aides are right when they say that the Republicans greatest resource is Mr Reagans ability to dictate the mood and issues of the Congressional campaigns
SENATE ABORTION FOES LOSE AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/14/us/senate-abortion-foes-lose-again.html,The Senate despite President Reagans urging fell 15 votes short today in its second effort to end a liberal filibuster that has been blocking action on antiabortion legislation The vote was 45 to 35 to end the debate but 60 votes were needed for the move to carry Conservative supporters of the abortion legislation picked up a handful of votes since last Thursday when the first effort to limit the twoweek filibuster failed on a 47to41 vote The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee who noted before the vote that a number of senators had not yet returned from the Labor Day recess called for a third limitation vote this Wednesday But even Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina leader of the antiabortion forces conceded that he was not certain he would gain the total of 60 votes needed to win on Wednesday Senator Baker also said that on Tuesday he would seek to bring up a proposed federalism constitutional amendment by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah which would allow Congress and the states to restrict or ban abortion But Senator Baker acknowledged it was highly unlikely that he would get the unanimous consent required for him to do so President Reagan had pledged his full effort to winning passage of antiabortion legislation and urged members in telephone calls and letters last week to vote to crack the filibuster Before todays session Senator Baker speaking of the antiabortion legislation told reporters My commitment is to a full and thorough debate That means well go the last mile to give proponents every opportunity However he said that he would have to take another look at the situation if the third cloture attempt failed saying Weve got to pass a debt limit bill
REAGAN MODIFIES TAX CREDIT PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/15/us/reagan-modifies-tax-credit-plan.html,President Reagan bearing down on social issues in advance of the November elections today indicated approval of Capitol Hill compromises aimed at bringing tuition tax credits out of committee for debate The President seeking progress on at least some of the bills on social issues that are favored by his conservative constituency met with a group of religious news editors at the White House and urged passage of tuition tax credits for students in private schools with added safeguards to prevent the use of credits for racially segregated schools In discussing the safeguards worked out on Capitol Hill the President told the editors I have to believe that obviously such schools would have to meet the standards of integration and be open to all Stalemate on Abortion Measure At the same time Mr Reagan took note of the failure to overcome a Senate filibuster against proposed restrictions on abortions He said that if the standoff in the Senate continued the issue might have to be put aside A greater attempt at unity by the antiabortion groups would have helped their campaign Mr Reagan asserted adding Ive been a little critical sometimes to myself not openly about some of the human life groups because first of all they have not rallied behind a single measure One of the points the President made on abortion was challenged soon afterward That was his assertion that there was a record of premature births at the threemonth stage in which the infants survived to be normal human beings I think the fact that children have been prematurely born even down to the threemonth stage and have lived to the record shows to grow up and be normal human beings  that ought to be enough for all of us Mr Reagan told the editors In less than an hour specialists on the abortion issue were rebutting this citing a brief in a case now before the Supreme Court in which the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists asserts there is no scientific or medical evidence that a fetus is viable at 22 weeks or less A White House spokesman later acknowledged that Mr Reagan had misspoken in saying three months Little Hope of Approval Privately White House specialists indicated little hope of final Congressional approval of the tuition credit and antiabortion measures But publicly with the Congressional elections less than two months off it was clearly important to Mr Reagan to emphasize his longstanding identification with the issues both in his remarks to the religious news editors and in a meeting at the White House with the chief Senate sponsors of the tuition credit bill Later White House officials indicated support of a number of compromises designed to move the tuition credit bill through the Senate Finance Committee to floor debate including tighter standards to prevent racial discrimination and to prosecute abuses The tuition bill originated by the Reagan Administration would let individual taxpayers take a credit against their income taxes of 50 percent of the cost of tuition for each child in private elementary and secondary schools The benefits would be available to families with adjusted gross income up to 50000 a year with smaller credits for income up to 75000 The proposal would cost 395 billion in lost revenue over five years according to estimates Critics have attacked the proposal as an unconstitutional support of religion by the Government  White House Concedes Error WASHINGTON Sept 14 AP After Mr Reagan asserted today that babies born after three months gestation have lived to the record shows to grow up and be normal an official spokesman acknowledged that Mr Reagan had misspoken Pete Roussel deputy White House press secretary said at first that he did not know where Mr Reagans information about a surviving 3monthold fetus had come from Mr Roussel later said that Mr Reagan had meant to say 4 12 months not three Mr Roussel said that according to the National Right to Life Committee a baby born 18 weeks after conception in 1972 at Cincinnati University Hospital survived
2 HOUSE LEADERS URGE BILL TO ENCOURAGE BALANCED BUDGET NEXT YEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/15/us/2-house-leaders-urge-bill-to-encourage-balanced-budget-next-year.html,The chairman of the House Budget Committee and the House majority whip today proposed legislation that would require the President and Congressional budget panels to submit balanced budgets Under the proposal however both the President and the committees could also submit unbalanced budgets if either decided that national security or economic necessity required deficit spending Congress would then choose between a balanced or unbalanced budget The move was seen as an effort to ward off a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget The amendment has been approved by the Senate but is bottled up in the House Judiciary Committee Asked whether the proposed bill was a response to the budgetbalancing budget amendment Representative James R Jones an Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee replied I dont think you can overlook the balanced budget movement But he said in an interview that a statutory approach to a balanced budget would have more immediacy than the constitutional approach and added One of the purposes is to get a statute in place that can be implemented next year Mr Jones and Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the House majority whip sent a letter to colleagues in which they said A statutory approach has the advantage of beginning to work upon passage not at some distant time in the future A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget would have to be ratified by threefourths of the states a process that often takes years The proposed legislation which has been circulating in Congressional offices since last month would limit spending to 20 percent of the gross national product and provide for only one budget resolution annually The measure would also require the chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees to agree with the director of the Office of Management and Budget on a common set of economic assumptions including predictions of the inflation unemployment and interest rates and would establish priorities that the Budget Committees must follow in balancing the budget Budget Deficit Underestimated This year the President submitted a budget for the fiscal year 1983 that had a projected deficit of 915 billion which Congressional Budget Committees believed was grossly underestimated Congress spent several months trying to keep the deficit below 100 billion and last spring adopted a budget with a projected deficit of 1045 billion The Congressional Budget Office however estimated the deficit at 140 billion Congress adopted the Budget Act in 1974 in an effort to regain fiscal controls that it had yielded to the White House The measure required Congress to set spending ceilings and revenue floors as well as spending priorities Battles over those priorities have dominated the 97th Congress with President Reagan and Republicans in Congress successfully shifting those priorities to provide a greater proportion of funds for the military and a smaller proportion for social programs Senator Pete V Domenici the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said he was unfamiliar with the proposal but doubted its workability He added however that anything we can do to get the process started is all right with me referring to the need for a balanced budget Little Support in the House Nor did the proposal evoke a groundswell of support in the House Representative Jack Brooks a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Government Operations Committee told the House Budget Committee today that he opposed both a constitutional amendment and a statutory requiredment involving a balanced budget Most of the people who want a constitutional amendment dont want a statute he said and most people who dont want a constitutional amendment dont want a statute either In a related development Howard H Baker Jr of Tennesee the Senate majority leader served notice to his Republican colleagues that he would not permit the debt limit bill to be delayed beyond this week because of a filibuster against an amendment involving abortion and school prayer Senator Baker told the Republicans that if the filibuster survived another effort Thursday to invoke cloture he would move to recommit the debt limit bill and have it reported out without any amendments The House has approved the debt limit extension in its Budget Resolution The measure sought by the White House would increase the debt limit to 1290 billion
HOUSE APPROVES $47 BILLION FOR HOUSING AND URBAN AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/16/us/house-approves-47-billion-for-housing-and-urban-aid.html,The House today approved a bill providing 47 billion for housing and urban development in the 1983 fiscal year The vote was 343 to 38 The White House supported the bill even though it includes 352 million more than President Reagan requested The bill now goes to the Senate Representative Edward P Boland the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the housing subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee said in the House It is true that we are over the Presidents budget but that is because in some areas his request was so low it was impossible to support Edwin L Dale a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said We are measuring all the appropriations bills not against the Presidents budget as in the past but under the appropriate ceiling in the budget resolution That is the compromise that the President endorsed Housing appropriations are expected to match the figure in the budget ceiling after another vote on subsidies New White House Practice Mr Dales endorsement nevertheless constituted a departure from past practices in which the White House used the Presidents own budget proposal as the yardstick of whether a bill was a budget buster Congress had grown increasingly angry over the ensuing Presidential vetoes Mr Dale emphasized however that the new policy was not related to the overriding by Congress of a 141 billion supplemental spending bill last week He said the policy was formulated last month although todays bill was the first time that it was applied House and Senate leaders met today to discuss whether it will be necessary to call Congress back into a special session in November or December Such a session is sought by the chairmen of the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate but not by Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachussetts or Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader Stopgap Spending Bill at Issue The issue is a stopgap spending bill to keep the Government operating beyond Oct 1 the start of the 1983 fiscal year The appropriations chairmen seek a short stopgap bill called a continuing resolution to enable their committees to report out the 13 individual appropriations bills needed Representative Jamie L Whitten Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee seeks a bill that would expire Nov 15 while Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Senate committee seeks one expiring Dec 15 Mr ONeill and Mr Baker want bills that would expire next year after the 98th Congress takes office Military spending is an issue in the negotiations The appropriations chairmen want their military spending subcommittees to be able to whittle down the Presidents request for military spending They would use the threat of a longer stopgap bill under which military spending would continue at the lower levels of the 1982 fiscal year Should Congress be brought back for a special session dealing with the appropriations bill it could also take action on Social Security abortion school prayer and many other pending issues The appropriations bill adopted today does not contain housing subsidies because Mr Boland said Congress had not yet approved authorizing legislation that sets housing policy This legislation was pending because the Administration had not yet decided what type of housing legislation it wanted he added But in remarks on the House floor Mr Boland said It is my intention to recommend no more than 96 billion for fiscal 1983 for subsidized housing This would bring the total funds for the measure up to 566 billion which would be exactly the budget ceiling figure Other Funds in Bill The measure also provides 34 billion for community planning and development 37 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency 729 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency 68 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Agency and 46 billion for the Treasury Department Democratic leaders in Congress meanwhile held a news conference to discuss their legislative proposal that would provide 1 billion to finance 200000 jobs for rebuilding and repairing the countrys bridges roads and water systems The House will take up the bill Thursday We can no longer accept in good conscience the argument that Congress should sit and do nothing while the jobless rate continues to climb Speaker ONeill said in a letter to members of Congress We need to act and act now to end the vicious cycle that allows a growing fear of unemployment to discourage consumers and investors alike  Emissions Penalties Opposed WASHINGTON Sept 15 AP  The House voted today to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from penalizing states that do not impose exhaust emission tests and maintenance programs on their motorists Critics of the auto emission control program said motorists in more than half the states would face hundreds of millions of dollars in increased costs if the Environmental Protection Agency is permitted to require the exhaust programs But Representative Bill Green Republican of Manhattan called the vote a major weakening of the Clean Air Act The ban adopted on a vote of 200 to 184 was added to a 47 billion appropriations bill providing money for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal agencies including the EPA But the House also voted to block any effort by the agency in the next year to weaken air quality standards for carbon monoxide a major pollutant from vehicles and to increase 1983 environmental protection funds by 77 million more than President Reagan recommended

SENATE KILLS PLAN TO CURB ABORTION BY A VOTE OF 47-46,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/16/us/senate-kills-plan-to-curb-abortion-by-a-vote-of-47-46.html,The Senate today voted to kill a proposal to restrict severely a womans right to obtain an abortion The vote was 47 to 46 with Senator Jim Sasser Democrat of Tennessee providing the deciding vote after the issue seemed stalemated The vote which came a few days after President Reagan threw his support behind the legislation means that the attempt to reverse the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973 is almost certainly doomed for this session of Congress However it is likely that Congress will continue to restrict the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions through Medicaid and other Government programs The proposal would have permanently banned the use of Federal funds for abortions and would have encouraged legal efforts to reverse Supreme Court decisions permitting abortion in the first three months of pregnancy The measure drafted by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina was offered as a rider to a bill raising the national debt limit Money Bills to Come First In another setback for the President Senate Republican leaders said today that they would not push vigorously for other legislation recently promoted by Mr Reagan including tuition tax credits and a package of crime control bills After meeting the President this morning Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader said that his must list for the rest of the Congressional session contained only three items a bill raising the national debt limit appropriations bills to provide funds for Government functions and a continuing resolution to finance operations not covered by specific appropriations bills While it is possible that other legislation will reach the Senate floor for debate any important bills not on Mr Bakers list face serious obstacles in becoming law before Congress adjourns for the election campaign early next month Reagan Has a Longer List The White House issued a list of Mr Reagans legislative priorities today that included a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget the legalization of organized school prayer tuition tax credits regulatory reform job training anticrime bills money for the Presidents Caribbean Basin Initiative and restrictions on abortion Congressional leaders believe the list was developed largely for political purposes as a gesture to Mr Reagans conservative supporters who have been pushing for much of the legislation on this agenda since his inauguration Senator Baker dismissed it by saying The President like most senators always asks for more than theyre going to get An aide to the Senate leader added The White House laundry list is much longer than ours Opposition on Capitol Hill For most of his Presidency Mr Reagan has concentrated on economic issues and pushed such social issues as abortion and school prayer into the background With conservative criticism of his record rising and with Congressional elections approaching the President recently revived his lobbying efforts through campaign speeches radio addresses and press briefings But all of his proposals have significant opposition on Capitol Hill and there is wide agreement in Congress that Mr Reagans efforts came too late to make much difference Opponents of Senator Helmss antiabortion motion have been staging a filibuster against it since last month Today the Helms forces failed for the third time to stop the delaying tactics and invoke cloture That decision requires 60 votes the cloture move today received 50 votes while 44 senators voted against it After the failure to invoke cloture Senator SI Hayakawa Republican of California moved to table the Helms amendment a device that in effect defeats a bill It was Senator Hayakawas motion that prevailed after Senator Sasser broke a 46to46 tie Baker Plays a Key Role Senator Baker who opposes abortion also played a key role when he withheld his vote at the last moment thus allowing the tabling motion to win The remaining legislative assault on abortion was also ended today when Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah agreed to delay until next year a floor debate on a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow states to pass legislation restricting abortion Mr Hatch who faces a tough reelection fight this fall said he wanted to have the debate on his amendment without the time and political pressures that are now buffeting Capitol Hill Still pending before the Senate is another Helms amendment to the debt ceiling bill that would allow organized school prayer by prohibiting the Supreme Court from ruling on the issue Senate leaders hope to dispose of the amendment Thursday and pass a bill that involves only the debt ceiling The school prayer issue has more support than the antiabortion move however and strategy was still being discussed as the Senate finished talking tonight Responding to Constituents In analyzing the vote today Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who was one of the leaders of the filibuster against the Helms amendment said the lawmakers were responding to their constituents By any measure of public opinion people are 2 to 1 in favor of a prochoice position on abortion Senator Packwood said adding that for the first time prochoice groups did a firstrate job of lobbying Borrowing tactics used by conservative activists for years these groups generated considerable mail and telephone calls to Congressional offices and neutralized some of the political influence exercised by abortion opponents Senators for the first time have really thought about this issue said Joanne Howes legislative representative for Planned Parenthood And they decided that abortion is not where the Federal Government belonged
SCHOOL PRAYER BILL BRINGS NEW FILIBUSTER IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/us/school-prayer-bill-brings-new-filibuster-in-senate.html,In a day filled with electionyear maneuvering Senate liberals opened a new filibuster today this time against a bill that would permit officially sponsored prayer in public schools The delaying tactics began after behindthescenes negotiations failed to dispose of the proposal which has been offered by Senator Jesse Helms as an amendment to legislation raising the national debt ceiling The sticking point is that sponsors of the prayer bill with White House backing are demanding a recorded vote on their plan The measure has little chance of becoming law this year but a public vote would give conservatives potent ammunition to use against lawmakers who oppose the bill For precisely that reason opponents of the prayer bill would like to avoid a vote on the issue Why should we give Jesse Helms a vote to target people with  asked David Landau a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union See a Diversionary Tactic In addition Capitol Hill analysts point out that by promoting school prayer and other social issues President Reagan and his allies are diverting attention from the slumping economy their biggest liability in the November elections Another issue now being pressed by the Reagan Administration is tuition tax credits and today the Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill that would give 300 worth of credits by 1985 for payment of private school tuition for each student Before approving the bill by a vote of 11 to 7 the committee added language that would ban the use of credits for tuition to schools that discriminate Like the school prayer bill a measure on tuition tax credits is not likely to pass Congress this year But it is a popular issue with some important voting groups particularly Roman Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants who send their children to private schools The school prayer bill now being filibustered would eliminate Supreme Court jurisdiction over the issue As a result states and localities would be free to enact school prayer programs without fear that they would be overturned by the courts In a series of cases starting in 1962 the courts have ruled that any form of organized prayer violates the constitutional separation of church and state Legality Worries Smith Attorney General William French Smith has also indicated that Senator Helmss bill might be unconstitutional and it has drawn strong criticism from organized bar and civil liberties organizations Because the bill raises so many legal questions the White House would prefer to see Congress take up a constitutional amendment that flatly legalizes organized prayer But the Administrations main concern now an aide to the Senate leadership said is that lawmakers be forced to commit themselves publicly on the issue Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican who is leading the filibuster against the Helms bill said he would accept a deal that gave the White House and its friends a recorded vote and a symbolic victory But he wanted assurances that the prayer amendment would then be wiped out immediately by a procedural vote and that the issue would not come up again in this session When Senate leaders could not give him that assurance today the filibuster proceeded A vote to invoke cloture to cut off the debate will be taken on Monday Negotiations to resolve the stalemate were complicated by word that Congress will probably be called back for a lame duck session after the November elections Easing the time pressure on the lawmakers took some of the air out the sails of those talks the Senate aide said The prayer issue blossomed only one day after the Senate decided by a single vote to kill another Helms proposal that would have restricted a womans right to an abortion

"ONCE AGAIN, CONGRESS IS PLAYING POLITICS AS USUAL",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/us/once-again-congress-is-playing-politics-as-usual.html,As sure as the leaves turn and wives lose their husbands to the television set for weekend football electionyear politics takes over the legislative process in this season and partisan posturing assumes as much importance as the substance of policy Given these natural seasonal rhythms few politicians have raised any eyebrows over the fact that President Reagan has stepped up his courting of disgruntled conservatives with some ostentatious legislative flourishes Lately he has made a show of pushing on tuition tax credits an antiabortion measure and the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget as well as offering a new anticrime proposal even though Republican leaders in Congress see little real prospect that these measures will pass before the legislature stops work to allow fulltime campaigning in October House Democratic leaders have their eye on making points with the electorate too Eager to diminish the news space devoted to budget cutting a process that usually enhances Republican imagery they have maneuvered to keep the focus on issues such as military spending and unemployment that Democrats feel they can better exploit Jobs Bill Assailed There were for example howls of dismay from Republicans in todays debate over the 1 billion Democratic jobs bill that this was an illconceived poorly drafted partisan electionyear gimmick A billiondollar ballot box bailout bill said Representative John J Rhodes Republican of Arizona Representative Bob Michel the House Republican leader suggested that Democratic leaders had been goaded by editorials and news columns criticizing them for not producing clearcut alternatives to the Reagan Administrations economic program with an election so near Six seven weeks until the elections and some of the pundits were saying Where is that vigorous liberal Democratic Party   Mr Michel taunted Theyve shamed the Democratic leadership into coming up with a lastminute program to throw in the hopper and save them for the election But still House Republicans dared not take the political risk of merely voting against the Democratic bill in the face of 98 percent unemployment So they hurriedly produced a 15 billion jobs bill of their own even though they know that President Reagan philosophically opposes bills that create temporary public jobs Everything Is Political With rising rhetoric Democratic leaders mocked the Republicans for copying their jobs bill while preaching patience with the Reagan economic program Charges of manipulation and shallow cynicism by the Republican minority is just boilerplate Congressional language for a proposal made by your opponent huffed Tom Foley the House Democratic whip Everything Congress does is political he added defensively Weve been working on this jobs bill for months It wasnt deliberately held back to come out now It took us time to get our own people lined up for it But obviously it touched a raw nerve because this is the most sensitive issue for Republicans Their only answer to the unemployed is Wait And so their reaction is to lash out at Democrats Even the technical rules of debate can raise hackles these days Republican leaders contend that the House Democratic leaders put them in a parliamentary box by sending the jobs bill to the House floor governed by a debate rule that permitted only one Republican amendment or substitute Building a Record With an opportunity for multiple amendments Mr Michel and his allies say they could have modified and improved the Democratic bill made it a bipartisan measure and thus neutralized it politically But with the limited rule they say they knew in advance the Republican version would be defeated and the Democratic version passed in a virtually straight partyline vote Its a classic case of the Democrats building themselves a bit of a political record on unemployment said a senior Republican staff aide I think were making some points acknowledged a Democratic legislative strategist close to the House leadership The struggle is over what gets the top news play We have to get out there and show the people that we care about jobs and interest rates I think we can get some mileage Its a struggle Were still in the status of Afghan rebels But weve just taken a convoy or two The partisan sniping has got to the point where House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr added to his personal criticism of Mr Reagan in the legislative debate over the Presidents veto of the supplemental appropriation bill Man With a Stone Heart At that time he called Mr Reagan a man with a stone heart Pressed to defend that during an interview on the NBC Today show this morning Mr ONeill said Not only has he got a stone heart but he has ice water in his veins Vice President Bush has given a rebuttal interview to be aired on the program Friday morning Privately veteran politicians on both sides lament that the obvious electioneering is such an obstacle to getting much serious work done Some make tongueincheek attacks on their opponents for the manauevering and chuckle at similar ploys by their own side Of course we never engage in that skulduggery joked Richard Cheney a Repblican House member from Wyoming after he had criticized the Democratic jobs bill in an interview today More seriously he added Now it is clearly campaign time and the troops are energized and for the next seven weeks we arent going to get much done The only two things that have to be done before the election is raising the debt ceiling and passing a continuing resolution and then well probably be back for a lame duck session President Reagan proposed just such a session today because so few appropriations bills for 1983 are expected to be passed before Congress breaks Oct 8 for the election campaign Already Democrats are assessing that move in political terms The President is making the Democrats look responsible for an inefficient legislative process said a senior House Democratic aide It fits into the Republican agenda of keeping the public focus on spending
"ABORTION FOES, HAILING REAGAN EFFORTS, PLAN TO RENEW STALLED DRIVE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/us/abortion-foes-hailing-reagan-efforts-plan-to-renew-stalled-drive.html,The disparate parts of the antiabortion lobby insisted today that despite a Senate defeat Wednesday President Reagans personal intervention had forced greater unity on them for a stronger attempt next year A few days before the 47to46 vote to kill the legislative proposal the President endorsed the proposal to severely restrict the ability of women to obtain abortions I had thought there was footdragging over at the White House on this said Peter B Gemma executive director of the National ProLife Political Action Committee But the White House staff came through even if it was the 11th hour and it was Reagan himself who pushed them all and even got George Bush of all people involved Vice President Bush who previously drew complaints from the antiabortion lobby drew high marks and was even promised a bouquet of red roses the movements kudos for his busy lastminute lobbying to break the filibuster that blocked the antiabortion efforts No Complaints From Lobby There had been signs early in the week that the White House might prefer to deal with the Senate fight over abortion with less than the enthusiasm afforded some of the showdown votes over the budget But there was no such complaint today from various members of the antiabortion lobby who have been disputing whether to proceed along the path of a constitutional amendment or of budgetary and legislative restrictions The interest of the White House in the Senate fight had been rated by one involved worker as routine showcasing in which Mr Reagan would speak up once again with no expectation of Senate approval for an issue that is important to his conservative constituency But Mr Reagan showed up at a meeting Tuesday between White House strategists and antiabortion leaders and he stayed for a halfhour taking a surprisingly attentive and reassuring role in subsequent lobbying according to participants This issue doesnt burn in the hearts of most people around here a White House staff member conceded noting that some workers might be preoccupied with the endless budget skirmishes and forget that the abortion issue helped put Mr Reagan in the White House We dont wake up palpitating about it But that doesnt matter What matters is not to forget the President cares and will be out campaigning on this issue While the antiabortion lobby was being outmaneuevered by opponents in the Senate officials at the White House were paying the closest attention on another level that of political opinion polls reflecting Mr Reagans renewed emphasis on this topic and other social issues in advance of the Congressional election campaign this fall Encouraged by Poll Results As the President spoke out publicly for tighter abortion controls at a meeting of religious news editors at the White House Richard Wirthlin Mr Reagans polltaker privately submitted his latest readings They were favorable according to an official who noted that the crucial facet at this level was not hard legislative progress but fresh fine tuning of the familiar Reagan social issues The data were encouraging regardless of the Senate vote according to the official They suggested that Mr Reagan was angled well at the crosscurrent of the issue in which a majority opposed to Federal spending for abortions can roughly neutralize a majority favoring a womans freedom of choice on the question Other socialissue readings are even more promising and White House officials in particular would like to see a proposal for voluntary school prayer brought to floor debate as soon as possible Before the Senate vote Mr Reagan had been surprisingly critical of the antiabortion lobby for its failure to get behind a single measure There is no problem with the Presidents personal commitment on this said Paul M Weyrich president of Coalition for America a conservative lobby group Noting that Mr Reagan had called an unsuccessful unity meeting of the antiabortion groups last winter at the White House Mr Weyrich estimated that progress toward unity had been made as an aftereffect of the Senate fight and that Mr Reagan had played a key role in prodding it We had hoped for action to match his words said Dr Jack Willke the president of the National Right to Life Committee They had the option to sit on their hands at the White House and they didnt Opponents of the antiabortion lobby contend its assertions of new unity and vows for a tougher fight next year are merely anticlimactic hopes with the White House mainly interested in controlling the issues boiling point But participants in the lobby said in particular that they believed Mr Reagans assistant for legislative affairs Kenneth M Duberstein when he promised to wage a stronger campaign next year
REAGAN AND BLACKS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/us/reagan-and-blacks-news-analysis.html,By denouncing Great Society programs of the Johnson Administration in a speech to a black audience President Reagan provided fresh ammunition for critics who say he is trying to reverse the racial progress of the last 20 years The Presidents speech Wednesday night to a convention of the National Black Republican Council has also fueled anew the partisan debate over Mr Reagans personal sensitivity to blacks and his understanding of black history That debate gained force today because of the intensely negative Democratic reaction to the Presidents speech and because the speech coincided with a series of meetings in Washington this week by black groups that are sharply divided on the question of Mr Reagans racial attitudes Robert Neuman a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee predicted that the Presidents speech would drive his poll standing with blacks still lower and would provide an opportunity for effective attack on Mr Reagan Were going to capitalize on that he said Were galvanizing reaction GOP Cleavage Disclosed Glossed over in the exchange of accusations was the fact that Mr Reagans appearance at the black Republicans convention disclosed a cleavage between the White House political strategy for the fall elections and the Republican Partys official position on black recruitment Officially the Republican National Committee is committed to using the Black Republican Council which has 10000 members to recruit more black party members But White House strategists believe there is little Mr Reagan can do to win more black voters for the party between now and the elections in November These strategists acknowledge that Mr Reagans main reason for appearing before black audiences is not to gain black supporters but to reassure moderate whites who might reject his leadership if he appeared to be prejudiced against blacks Mr Reagans senior black adviser Melvin J Bradley acknowledged that White House polls show Mr Reagans approval rating among blacks was in the teens Moreover another adviser added the negative feelings that led to this low approval rating were growing stronger because of Mr Reagans budget cuts and his policy of having the Justice Department and other agencies abandon some of the established legal remedies for discrimination The intensity with which blacks reject Reagans program is much higher now than it was earlier because they feel that they have carried more than their fair burden this adviser said Backfire Held Possible Democratic spokesmen predicted today that Mr Reagans attempt to use a black forum to improve his standing with white moderates might backfire by prompting a heavy black turnout in the fall elections While that is open to argument it was clear that the Presidents speech prompted an immediate toughening of campaign talk from both sides For example Representative Mickey Leland of Texas chairman of the black caucus of the Democratic National Committee said Black people in this country believe whether he denies the allegation or not that he is racist Everytime he makes these statements it helps our cause On the other side Vice President Bush speaking to the black Republicans convention today warned that such attacks on Mr Reagan were the beginning of a low road campaign by the Democrats this fall Mr Bushs remark to the black audience were in response to House Speaker Thomas J ONeill Jrs remark today that Mr Reagan has ice water for blood when it comes to poor people The racial issue was brought into sharp focus by a series of events that started with the meeting in midweek of the black Republicans and the convening on Friday of the annual conference of the Black Congessional Caucus In addition the Washington Council of Lawyers issued a 138page report accusing Mr Reagan of crippling civil rights enforcement at the Justice Department At about the same time Mr Reagans black appointee to the chairmanship of United States Commission on Civil Rights Clarence M Pendleton called on the President to allay black fears by convening a minority summit conference at Camp David Md Reminder From Conservatives The suggestion by Mr Pendleton who is a Republican opposed to the civil rights enforcement policies of the past was part of a polite effort by black conservatives to remind Mr Reagan that he has cut himself off from the nations black leadership groups The Congressional Black Caucus for example has not been invited to the White House since Feb 19 1981 Members of the Black Leadership Forum which represents a number of civil rights groups have complained that they have not received a response to requests for a meeting this year The White House brushed aside Mr Pendletons suggestion of a summit meeting More quietly it has ignored appeals from black Republicans to appoint a black who would occupy a White House office and have the title of Deputy Counselor to the President Timothy L Jenkins an organizer of the black Republican convention said that despite these things Mr Reagan still had some black support But hes got to do something with it said Mr Jenkins a Washington executive It wont be there forever Its halfway through his Administration and hes got to act Mr Jenkins added that Mr Reagan cant keep talking about cutting school lunch programs abortion and tax breaks to private schools and not recognize that our interests are not served by these things In his speech Mr Reagan who has approved financial aid for black colleges and medical schools nonetheless rejected any general appeals to blacks through Government programs designed to subsidize the disadvantaged Criticizing the Democrats rhetoric of compassion he asserted that Republicans must attract blacks with the promise of economic selfhelp Hardened Attitude Perceived The dispute over Government versus freemarket solutions to black problems has been one main point of debate this week The other has been the quality of Mr Reagans caring for blacks Representative Mervin M Dymally Democrat of California said in an interview Wednesday that Mr Reagan had undergone a hardening of attitude since he was Governor of California He was not a footinconcrete ideologue as he appears to be now said Representative Dymally who was a California legislator when Mr Reagan approved a number of programs to help blacks Now he added Mr Reagan does not understand black history or the symbolic importance of Government programs that he cuts for budgetary reasons There is his failure Mr Dymally concluded He thinks blacks have the same opportunity to start at the drugstore and end up as president of the corporation The black allies and critics of Mr Reagan are also sniping at one another Walter E Fauntroy a Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia said here that black Republicans were allowing themselves to be used by the White House to justify what everyone knows is an obvious attempt to erode the laws the programs and institutions that black people have fought for in the last 30 years LeGree Daniels chairman of the National Black Republican Council countered that her group was a truth squad refuting distortions spread by those with a vested interest in social welfare programs

PRESIDENT VISITS JERSEY TO; HELP REP. FENWICK,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/18/nyregion/president-visits-jersey-to-help-rep-fenwick.html,President Reagan came to New Jersey today to give his support to a fellow Republican Representative Millicent Fenwick in her race for the Senate against the Democrat Frank Lautenberg From a posh fundraising event under a green and white tent on the lawn of a bucolic inn to a dusty fairground where thousands of ItalianAmericans celebrated the feast of San Gennaro Mr Reagan pressed the causes of his party stopping from time to time to greet people who had waited for hours to see him In between he paused to be with a group of newly naturalized American citizens and then to meet with Republican Party leaders from the Northeast Its great to get out of the White House and have some fun once in a while Mr Reagan said He arrived at Mercer County Airport just before 230 PM accompanied on Air Force One by Mrs Fenwick Representatives James A Courter of Hackettstown and Christopher H Smith Jr of Trenton and Senator Nicholas Brady all Republicans He traveled by helicopter to the Ryland Inn a 200yearold hostelry in the rural village of Whitehouse in Hunterdon County There at a 500aperson buffet that raised 100000 for the Fenwick campaign he called the Congresswoman from Bernardsville a woman of character independence and wisdom He noted that they had differed on some issues but he added I know when we do disagree I know we can sit down together Then alluding to one of Mrs Fenwicks wellknown trappings he said Shes even suggested we can smoke the pipe of peace together The President traveled in a motorcade to the nearby village of Whitehouse Station to help officiate at a ceremony where 77 newly naturalized citizens from 39 countries took the oath of citizenship The ceremony was held at the PolishAmerican Hall and Mr Reagan used the occasion to sound again his criticism of the Polish Government We cannot help but think of the iron hand of repression still firmly gripping a people who have struggled and sacrificed for liberty throughtout their history he said When leaving a campaign stop in Flemington President Reagan was asked to respond to a statement by the Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly F Dobrynin who said that the reported takeover of the Soviet Embassy in Beirut was an act of aggression Mr Reagan replied You know those Russians you cant believe anything they say Just before 4 PM his motorcade returned to the Ryland Inn for a meeting with 12 Republican Party state chairmen members of the Northeastern States Chairmens Association Along the route which took him through the rolling hills of the New Jersey countryside and through the narrow streets of a small town he was cheered by lines of people waving flags and confronted by protesters calling for a freeze on nuclear weapons After his meeting with party leaders a conference that underscored the political nature of his trip he flew by helicopter to the Flemington fairground Mrs Fenwick introduced him to the crowd saying I think you know the President and I are not always in perfect accord but we know this country needs a change of direction For his part the President echoed a theme that Mrs Fenwick has made the cornerstone of her campaign  jobs Were going to knock that unemployment rate down just like were knocking down interest rates and inflation he said Practicing some local politics Mr Reagan announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had approved financing for a complex for elderly citizens in Ewing Township He glanced at Mrs Fenwick and added If you dont elect her Senator we will take it away He left the festival just after 530 PM for the return trip to Washington Mrs Fenwick and her aides say that they did not request the Presidential visit and that the campaign appearance had been made at the suggestion of the White House In an interview before the trip Mrs Fenwick said she welcomed the Presidents support and his efforts to help her raise campaign funds But she added that she was not close to the President and that the White House had never asked her to lobby for legislation it considered important I dont know that the President is coming in to support me as a loyal Republican she said I did override his veto and I do oppose him on other measures I dont know how he views me Republicans close to the White House say that while Mrs Fenwick may oppose some of the Administrations measures in the Senate her candidacy is part of a national fight to preserve the partys slender majority there and that that alone is reason enough for the President to campaign for her Mrs Fenwick has voted for Mr Reagans economic programs but she has also said I am not a convert to supplyside economics She is against further cuts in social programs and in general opposes the Presidents views on such matters as the equal rights amendment gun control and abortion State Republican leaders dismiss the differences between their partys nominee and the President Im not looking for orthodoxy and I dont think the people are said Philip D Kaltenbacher the Republican state chairman  Aides to the Congresswoman say their campaign strategy is to persuade the electorate that Mrs Fenwick follows her own counsel not the party line For his part Mr Lautenberg the Democratic candidate who has been campaigning against the Administrations policies said the trip clearly says that Mrs Fenwick is in step with the President and Ill be reminding the voters that she was happy to see him
VOTERS IGNORING 2d-HIGHEST POST IN STATE PRIMARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/18/nyregion/voters-ignoring-2d-highest-post-in-state-primary.html,It is called the secondhighest office in the state But as the candidates for Lieutenant Governor  Alfred B DelBello the Westchester County Executive and Carl McCall a former State Senator and member of the United States delegation to the United Nations  took their campaigns for the Democratic nomination on the road they found that most people did not even know what the Lieutenant Governor does or that there was a primary contest The secondhighest office doesnt always get the attention it deserves Mr McCall said recently while campaigning in Manhattan and Brooklyn Some of my friends suggest that this is how I am dealing with my midlife crisis Mr DelBello says the question most frequently asked is What does a lieutenant governor do No matter how hard you campaign he said while driving between two elderly citizen centers in the Bronx You dont get a sense of building on what you put in McCall Explains Break With Eve Both candidates have been on the defensive in the last few days Wednesday night during a debate before the Jewish Community Council of New York Mr McCall announced that he had broken with Arthur O Eve of Buffalo the deputy majority leader of the Assembly after Mr Eve said Mayor Koch is to the blacks as Hitler is to the Jews Mr Eve who was Mr McCalls field coordinator dropped out of the campaign and Mr McCall said he was outraged at the remark Such absurd linkage shows appalling insensitivity and lack of knowledge of the greatest tragedy of the 20th century he said Throughout my public life I have sought to bring people together and promote greater understanding between the black and Jewish communities Also last week Mr DelBello was faced with a request by his oppponent to seek the release of testimony in grand jury investigations going back to 1973 Mr DelBello said that the issues  including a private business deal by a law client campaign contributions and an investigation of a deputy police commissioner  had been fully aired in the past and had been raised out of desperation by Mr McCall He said he would consider requesting the release of the material after the primary The Lieutenant Governor like the Vice President of the United States has few formal duties He presides over the Senate voting only to break a tie serves on a dozen or so committees councils and trusteeships and takes over for the Governor in the case of illness or death GOPs Candidate Unopposed But in one of the unusual twists of New York State government each partys candidates for Lieutenant Governor and Governor run together on a ticket in the general election but compete separately in party primaries In the Republican Party the Assembly minority leader James L Emery is unopposed as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor and will run on a ticket with the winner of the gubernatorial primary When they are not attacking each other or Republicans in Washington both candidates vow to make the office more important than it has been in the past The Lieutenant Governor can work as a partner with the Governor in dealing with the severe problems of unemployment Mr McCall tells audience after audience I will use that platform to continue to speak out and challenge this Administration in Washington Mr DelBello who is favored by Mayor Koch a candidate for Governor speaks of a partnership with the Governor He also proposes to coordinate the states economic development activity and argues that his experience of managing and running local government is needed because the job of the Governor is too big Polls Say DelBello Leading So far most polls show that Mr DelBello has a significant lead but with more than half of the voters still undecided And both candidates have been frustrated by their inability to make their case to the voters Mr DelBello who is 48 years old has been County Executive since 1974 and is a former Councilman and Mayor in Yonkers So far he said he has not found any increase in awareness among voters but he has raised nearly 300000 and hopes that a lastminute television campaign will make a difference He emphasizes his links to Mr Koch but doubts that most voters will make a connection Mr McCall is 46 and lives on the West Side of Manhattan He is a graduate of Dartmouth College ordained by the United Church of Christ and was elected to three terms in the State Legislature He served as a United Nations member under Donald F McHenry and most recently was a senior vice president of WNET the public television station He has raised about 150000 so far and hopes to put together a lastminute television campaign and a large Election Day operation to bring out voters especially in minority communities in the state During the summer Mr McCall said his supporters helped register 125000 new voters Both candidates have made proposals on crime and economic development and both favor abortion rights and Medicaid financing of abortions Mr DelBello favors the death penalty while Mr McCall is opposed Mr McCall like Mr DelBello makes a favorable impression at his campaign appearances But his campaign has been marred by a shortage of funds and occasional disorganization On a campaign tour last week a campaign driver quit in the middle of the day leaving the candidate stranded in Manhattan
RACE IN THE SIXTH DISTRICT IS A BATTLE OF CONTRASTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/19/nyregion/race-in-the-sixth-district-is-a-battle-of-contrasts.html,NEW BRITAIN ON the night of the Sixth Congressional District primary an enthusiastic crowd of supporters of Nancy L Johnson candidate for the Republican nomination applauded each time a campaign worker entered the results from another town on the tally sheets on the wall But while the audience applauded Mrs Johnsons growing lead over the other Republican candidate Nicholas Shaus of Farmington a bigger response came when the campaign aide Pat Sullivan interrupted his work to announce the result on the Democratic side where William E Curry Jr of Farmington a colleague of Mrs Johnson in the State Senate was fighting a primary battle with Brendan Kennedy president of the New Britain board of aldermen and Gardner Wright Jr a State Representative from Bristol The candidate that Nancy Johnson has wanted to run against from day one Bill Curry is going to be her opponent said Mr Sullivan setting off a cheer Mrs Johnson a Republican moderate and Mr Curry the most liberal of the three candidates in the Democratic primary both won substantial victories and each professes to welcome the other to the race because of the contrast that the choice will offer the voters However because of the obvious economic distress of the district comprising 45 municipalities in the northwest corner of the state the most populous of which are ailing industrial centers such as New Britain Torrington and Winsted  both are putting economic revival as their primary goal with some differences in emphasis and in how each would go about the task after the voting on Nov 2 The seat being contested is now held by Toby Moffett Democrat of Litchfield who is running for United States Senate It is the only open House seat in the state without an incumbent who is seeing reelection As such it is generating much attention outside the district By the end of June Mrs Johnson had raised more than 172000 more than any other nonincumbent in Connecticut And even before the primary she had brought a prominent United States Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas to speak on her behalf Mr Curry meanwhile has had the benefit of the endorsement of Ralph Nader the consumer activist and has won endorsements from statewide labor and environmental organizations He also has the backing of the National Organization for Women Mr Curry entered the State Senate in 1979 representing the Ninth Senatorial District most of which lies in the First Congressional District However Farmington where he lives is in the Sixth A Hartford native and graduate of Georgetown University in Washington DC and the University of Connecticut Law School he served as an aide to Representative Moffett before entering the State Senate He is single and 30 years old He says his major difference with Mrs Johnson revolves around the economic policies of President Reagan all the principal components of which she has whole heartedly endorsed he said He noted the tremendous economic dislocation which has been inflicted upon this country and the tremendous anguish which thousands of workers and their families across this district are suffering as a result of Mr Reagans policies Mrs Johnson 47 years old and a resident of New Britain is now completing her third twoyear term in the State Senate representing New Britain the largest city in the Sixth District Her election in that city was a feat for a Republican the city has approximately 25000 Democrats versus just 7600 Republicans and 4100 unaffiliated voters A graduate of Radcliffe College in Cambridge Mass Mrs Johnson studied history at the University of Chicago and art history at the Courtault Institute of the University of London Married to Dr Theodore Johnson she is the mother of three daughters Mrs Johnsons background before seeking public office includes volunteer work with the United Way and the local public library This is an extremely important pivotal moment in US history she said with tremendous implications for the future of the nation the strength of our economy whether were able to adopt policies that foster real growth This will require a democracy learning to discipline itself in a way that enables it to adhere to sound longrun policies she said policies that may not be desirable in the twoyear election cycle Mrs Johnsons philosophy is similar to Ronald Reagans whose campaign she headed in the 1980 presidential primary in Connecticut She said that making better use of tax dollars and delegating more responsibility to state and local governments would be needed Nowhere in Bills record is there any concern with cost she said Mr Curry disagrees vigorously that his opponent has the same goals The assertion of Senator Johnson was that decentralizing government control and seeking further cuts in spending would in fact be the central issue of the debate he said Those are basically code words for the new federalism That he said was a scam to balance the Federal budget on the backs of people who pay the sales and property taxes in this country It will have a negative impact on this country it will encourage artificial migration of people from states who cannot or will not support essential social services to states like Connecticut he said Mr Curry also says that he is frugal with the publics money demonstrating this by having supported four consecutive Ella GrassoBill ONeill budgets All of us in this State Capitol have overseen an attrition of the workforce a tightening of the belt he said To demonstrate prudence in spending he called for a campaign spending limit of 106000 between the primary and the general election Mrs Johnson countered that such a limit would not take into account money spent on Mr Currys behalf by organizations supporting him Both candidates lay claim to the title of friend of small business Federal regulatory policies and investment policies are skewed toward the largest multinational corporations and away from small businesses said Mr Curry Mrs Johnson however cites a 100 percent rating of her voting record in the State Senate by the National Federation of Independent Businesses over the last four years far higher than her opponents rating Mr Curry according to the federation voted with the small business groups position once in the last year and against it three times by voting against changes in depreciation taxes against establishing a oneweek waiting period for collecting unemployment insurance and for an increase in unemployment compensation Mr Curry would like to lower interest rates for some industries including many small businesses by making special credit available to them Mrs Johnson favors legislation that will increase savings so that more will be available for investment and cut the Federal deficit which she said competes with businesses for investment money The two candidates agree on three of the strongest issues Both say that they are prochoice on the abortion question both oppose a constitutional amendment to allow school prayer and both oppose tuition taxcredits

given moment in Massachusetts politics there is the continual romantic seep of history so that the sharp smell of ringside is mingled with more nostalgic scents Consider this moment After the ferocity

honorable and interested in governing as opposed to just politics Both are different in outlook manner and philosophy from Governor King a conservatve lawandorder Irish Democrat who culivated the

intense darkbrowed compact son of Greek immigrants a resident of the suburban town of Brookline and a man who has tried hard in this campaign to shed the reputation for humorlessness and arrogance which he acquired as Governor Mr Sears the direct descendant of John Winthrop the first governor of the colony is a tall genial man of wry humor and sometimes distant manner Pinkfaced silver on top the lone inhabitant of a narrow townhouse on a cobbled street on Beacon Hill he has the reputation in Republican circles of being a bit of a character I may be the last practicing Yankee thats the comedy and tragedy of the rap he said as he sat with two aides planning for the campaign to come midst the litter of books and papers in his living room The rap he said came from a local political reporter who wondered in print what appeal a Puritan would have for the voters in 1982 Mr Sears who enjoys an exchange wrote the paper a letter defending the rosier qualities of the 17th century which he sees as social order individual responsibility the able management of resources the shepherding of ones life and flock Mr Sears for instance said he would seek to energize the private sector to create jobs and to handle social needs In the case of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority which increasingly loses money and riders too he would attempt to sell off the peripheral rail and bus lines to private enterprise Thats sheer fantasy Mr Dukakis says No ones going to pick them up Theyre losers Instead he would attempt to make government grow in service adding equipment and additional routes to bring the buses closer to the commuters and thus increasing ridership The Yankee heritage to which Mr Sears harks is a tradition of helmsmanship which has extended down into this century through such prominent Yankee political names as Bradford Saltonstall Cabot Lodge Herter and Sargent But Massachusetts politics has been crossbred by its own rich variety as Jonathan Moore a liberal Republican and director of the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard points out Not all Yankees were conservative or Republicans either Endicott Peabody the Yankee Governor from 1962 to 1964 was a Democrat John N Volpe the Republican who succeeded him was an ethnic Italian who went on to beat an Irish Democrat the next time around Mr Volpes successor Francis W Sargent was rather liberal for a Yankee and yet was a Republican who beat Kevin White the Irish Mayor of Boston Mr Sargent the last Yankee governor was himself beaten in 1974 by Mr Dukakis the GreekAmerican liberal Democrat who lost in turn in the primary of 1978 to Edward J King a conservative Irish Democrat Mr King went on to become Governor by defeating Francis W Hatch Jr the last Yankee Republican contender for the office But Governor King smudged by an administration wreathed in corruption last week lost the primary to Mr Dukakis who now faces Mr Sears a former state representative Boston City Councilman and Sargent appointee  and the only visibly remaining Yankee from the old tradition still involved in state politics That is the patchwork weave of Massachusetts politics On the face of it Mr Sears a lesser presence in the state and also the nominee of the lesser party is at a disadvantage There are 110000 fewer registered Republicans in Massachusetts now than there were 10 years ago  the legacy of Watergate There are three and a third times as many Democrats as Republicans But Governor King has not yet endorsed Mr Dukakis who refused to endorse Mr King when Mr King beat him four years ago It will be hard for Mr Dukakis to attract the range of votes in Mr Kings conservative coalition The powerful banking and insurance industries for instance remember how hard Governor Dukakiss banking and insurance commissioners were on them On the other hand says Robert C Wood the political scientist and author who has at times been professor at Harvard at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology president of the University of Massachusetts and superintendent of the Boston school system it will be hard for Mr Sears to embrace some of Mr Kings rightwing social issues such as opposing abortion Yankees he notes come from a tradition of social tolerance The Dukakis camp having spent 22 million defeating Governor King now waits and hopes for Mr Kings enorsement and plans to raise about another million to campaign against Mr Sears The Sears camp which spent 200000 winning the Republican nomination plans to raise 750000 to 1 million If as generally anticipated Mr Dukakis wins the governorship the way will not be easy The autocratic leadership of the Legislature is still the supreme power in the state Mr Wood says There are very few friends of Mike Dukakis in high places either in the government scene or the private sector Mr Wood says Hes coming in with considerable wariness
JUNIOR KNOWS BEST: TV'S VIEW OF CHILDREN TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/19/arts/junior-knows-best-tv-s-view-of-children-today.html,Edward Stratton 3d is 35 wealthy dimwitted naive and hopelessly immature He spends his days playing video games in his private arcade and riding around his mansion atop an oversized toy train Ricky his 12yearold son is a bright and sophisticated computer whiz as responsible as dad is feckless When Ricky tries to engage his father in a serious discussion Edward flops to his knees to demonstrate his favorite game Swamp Wars Asked by Ricky if the computer controlling their household gadgets has a random access memory Edward is the picture of slackjawed bewilderment Ricky and Edward belong to Silver Spoons a new situation comedy starting Saturday on NBC that presents a striking example of televisions view of contemporary childhood On television today the children are usually the grownups and the adults often seem more like children Of 23 new series tumbling into prime time this fall nine revolve around children or incorporate juvenile roles into their weekly plots Most of these youthful characters conform to the image of what sociologists call the adultified child epitomized by Gary Colemans wisecracking Arnold on NBCs Diffrent Strokes Such characters transcend the winsome precocity of the Shirley Temple variety the children in prime time tend to be miniature adults possessing the tastes mores sensibility knowledge and even cynicism that until recent years were the exclusive province of maturity Their portrayal is probably exaggerated and to some eyes it may represent mere innocent fun But the televised view of children may also have more troubling implications Television not only reflects currents of popular culture it also has the power to impose values Just as the images of the Nelson children on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet in the 1950s and 60s represented one vision of childhood so todays portrayals set up a new televised ideal that filters into the way we regard children  not to mention adults In todays ideal children are freighted with the same range of problems and preoccupations as their elders Role models have been torn down and authority has become ambiguous in a world where everyone despite age is on an equal footing What is being offered on television as a model and legitimate notion of childhood is an adult trapped in a childs body says Rose Goldsen professor of sociology at Cornell University The most obvious melding of juvenile and adult behavior can be caught in the television childs articulate expression of pop psychology and social trends In NBCs new series Family Ties daughter Jennifer who is 9 explains her frequent summons to the telephone by saying Its probably Chrissie again Shes going through a personal crisis adding Weve begun a dialogue On Square Pegs a new high school comedy on CBS the lunchroom percolates with trendy remarks like I think its so unfair that guys dont get cellulite Beyond a shared perspective and language many of todays video children seem superior to their often witless elders An NBC publicity release makes the case for Silver Spoons crystal clear Ricky helps Edward to be an adult and Edward teaches his son the pleasures of childhood Ricky also has considerable guile which he demonstrates when he deftly shifts to traditional little boy chatter I bet you make a billion zillion dollars to disarm the accountant he knows has stolen money from his father In Star of the Family a new comedy on ABC a talented 16yearold girl tries to make a career as a singer despite the clumsy efforts of her father a fireman to shelter her from the horrors of show business She is tolerant of his foolishness up to a point but then according to ABC her own life and goals take over and she becomes impatient with his rigid oldfashioned ways Family Ties makes the same points by positing two parents who are liberals from the Sixties generation against their three conservative children The father is palpably uneasy in his role He reacts emotionally to problems and confides his insecurities to his son Alex In a twist on the old Father Knows Best routine it is Alex who initiates a hearttoheart talk after his father has embarrassed him I know there are other fathers who are more in control more reserved more adult says the father but none who love their sons more than I love you Alex the paragon of reason and forgiveness then delivers the sort of homily once reserved for Robert Young urging his father to understand that they are two different people Do you think this will happen again asks Alex Were both getting older replies his father One of us is bound to grow up sooner or later Even in televisions escapist fantasies children seem to have the upper hand NBCs new series Voyagers features a doltish adventurer named Phineas Bogg who travels through time with a bright 11yearold boy As Bogg lurches in and out of scrapes mumbling oaths like bats breath the boy draws on his natural cunning and knowledge of history to extricate them both Such blurring of the traditional lines between adults and children is quite deliberate Paul Junger Witt one of the writers of ABCs new family comedy series It Takes Two says There is an enormous disservice to children who are impressionable to see a father who has all the answers When people had a steady diet of Father Knows Best and Leave it to Beaver says Mr Witt I wonder how many people came away from those shows thinking their parents had failed them The Cleavers on Beaver always managed to connect The father in his show says Mr Witt is bright sophisticated and worldly yet very often he wont have a satisfactory answer He can be wrong He can be a source of the problem The duality of father and friend can become confusing and painful We want to play with that Along with a new measure of authority televisions children are now enmeshed in every conceivable adult problem  from sex alcohol and drugs to concerns about the environment and nuclear war Films made for television have been especially graphic with portrayals of teenage prostitution Off the Minnesota Strip child pornography Fallen Angel and drug abuse Angel Dusted among the most popular in recent years This season will bring several more including Children of the Night about teenage prostitutes on ABC and Where are my Children on CBS about black market sales of children for adoption Children on weekly series also have their share of adultstyle complications NBCs Fame this fall will treat the subject of teenage suicide in one episode In It Takes Two the son Tony will become romantically involved with a woman 15 years his senior and the daughter Lisa will suffer depression about the possibility of a nuclear holocaust In an episode several weeks ago Patti the 7yearold daughter on NBCs Love Sidney was arrested for participating in a nonukes rally Sexuality is a favorite topic in series as well forming a thread of oneline innuendoes on such childcentered shows as NBCs Facts of Life and ABCs Joanie Loves Chachi Sometimes the treatment of sex can be frightening as in an episode of Little House on the Prairie last year when a young girl was raped and later died More often the messages about sex are ludicrous In one recent episode of Gimme a Break on NBC a young girls pregnancy culminated in a frantic scene at the home of her best friend while the girl writhed in labor a minister hastily performed her marriage to the babys father Few if any of these subjects were imaginable 15 or 20 years ago when the favorite primetime children were the Nelson boys and Beaver Cleaver Those characters were often mischievous even clever pranksters capable of outwitting their elders but never totally outclassing them The trick was to be cute says Miss Goldsen These depictions however unrealistic contained a conception of childhood writes Neil Postman professor of media ecology at New York University in his new book The Disappearance of Childhood These children dressed differently from adults They talked differently and saw problems from a different perspective How then to account for the dramatic shift from difference to similarity One important reason of course can be traced to the social upheavals of the 1960s that spawned feminism permissive sexuality a climbing divorce rate and a general questioning of authority in the government schools and the family These trends inevitably trickled down into high school and junior high schools But television may have played a role in their spread Television captured the Zeitgeist in the early 1970s and refracted our national preoccupations into situation comedies All in the Family Maude and a welter of topical films on previously taboo topics from rape to homosexuality The scope of news coverage broadened as well especially in the sensationalistic reports of local newscasts in the early evening Mr Postman and some other sociologists argue that because television began flooding the living room with this information previously known only by adults the notion of childhood itself began to disappear In the Middle Ages there were no children because there existed no means for adults to know exclusive information he writes In the age of Gutenberg such a means developed In the age of television it is dissolved While the printed word enabled adults to mete out secrets carefully to children over time the images of television can be taken in as readily by children as adults We are left with children who rely not on authoritative adults but on news from nowhere writes Mr Postman We are left with children who are given answers to questions they never asked We are left in short without children And in Mr Postmans opinion the blurring of the differences between adults and children exacerbated by the dispersal of adult secrets on television led inevitably to a change in the portrayal of children on television But to what degree does the current televised view reflect the real world of children As with past depictions there are a fair share of caricatures But Hollywood scriptwriters also make a conscious effort to fleck their work with realistic impressions The problems of the kids on our show are real problems says Mr Witt of It Takes Two They are not merely comedic conventions or springboards for story problems They are people We hope that people in their age groups respond to them as people who are serious about themselves By the same token William Blinn the executive producer of Fame about students at New Yorks School for the Performing Arts says his show is a conscious effort to reflect reality Part of that reality he says is the adult idea of the work ethic and buckling down to do it You cant do a show about preparing for a career in something as tough as the performing arts without touching on that Whether real or not these portrayals may indeed be affecting reality A number of research studies have shown that children can be influenced by television in varying ways George Comstock SI Newhouse professor of public communication at Syracuse University has written that some studies have found that adolescents derive ideas about how to act in social situations from television He cites the very real possibility that television entertainment may also make its contribution to the way young people come to think judge and act on questions of broad social and political significance Mr Postman believes that in the portrayal of children specifically there is a feedback effect Television senses what is happening in our culture that gives us a new set of models but then we see the models and believe that we ought to be that way Todays style of television children has so far proved popular enough to warrant this falls spate of new shows According to David W Duclon executive producer of Silver Spoons Ricky played by Ricky Schroder received one of the most positive responses from a sample audience test in NBCs history It is unlikely even if programs fail that Ricky and others like him will be supplanted by a return of innocent and protected children Most people no longer understand and want the traditional idealized model of the child because that model cannot be supported by their experience or imagination says Mr Postman Characters like the ones epitomized by Shirley Temple bobbing with little girl curls and singing childrens songs would probably work today only as parody or nostalgia Nor are the Hollywood scriptwriters likely to turn back the clock Mr Blinn believes that part of his job is to make sure kids have all the knowledge they can handle And Mr Duclon says I think television has served a very useful function in helping kids to realize that the world is complicated The age of innocence is gone But this loss of childhood innocence may be creating some unanticipated and possibly unpleasant side effects Statistics in recent years have shown alarming rises in juvenile crime teenage pregnancy and drug and alcohol abuse You change the balance and the whole social system has to readjust itself says Miss Goldsen Children can get abortions without parental consent They can divorce their parents in certain states There is a whole movement for childrens rights and there are legal cases providing the way in which juvenile delinquency is being assimilated into criminal behavior Moreover the values implicit in childhood may disintegrate as well If one wants to make an argument that we have made progress as civilized creatures since the Renaissance we would have to give the biggest chapter to the invention called childhood says Mr Postman Because around it form so many humane attitudes and institutions things like enthusiasm idealism education Mr Postman acknowledges that television has helped open new vistas to children and has made them more aware of their society than any previous generation But that is the whole point he contends The special age group we created and which brought to us some humane values will become obsolete and then everyone will become precocious

TV VIEW; FROM TRASH TO M*A*S*H,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/19/arts/tv-view-from-trash-to-m-a-s-h.html,Pity the situation comedy It may be popular just about monopolizing the Top 10 ratings positions year after year but it is also scorned When a movie reviewer or theater critic aspires to the heights of damnation we are likely to read that the production under consideration had the depth and complexity of a sitcom That dear friends is about as withering as your average analyst can get nowadays And needless to say the sitcom deserves a good deal of the bad press it has been getting The backbone of the form is rigid formula something that can serve as a convenient weekly container for carefully contrived plotlines In any given episode the characters are sketched in lightly as the story bounces along breezily sometimes mindlessly to a foregone conclusion Everything has a tidy beginning middle and end much to the delight of those who still appreciate the Aristotelian verities but naggingly irritating to those modernists who are partial to murkier reflections of reality Adding to the sitcoms sorry reputation is the indisputable fact that season after season more than 90 percent of the new entries on the schedule are conspicuous failures A sappy movie or an embarrassing play will drop out of circulation quietly having been seen by a relative handful of dazed customers But a new sitcom no matter how terrible is seen by millions of people leaving most of them with the unfortunate but understandable conviction that the TV form belongs at the bottom of the entertainment totem pole The situation comedy however need not hang its head in total shame The form has had its share of outstanding achievements going back to the early madcap farces of I Love Lucy I recently found myself watching one of those shows in the Dominican Republic and they are still funny even in Spanish What is truly striking about the sitcom is the enormous width of its content boundaries A giant leap forward was taken in the early 1970s with Norman Lears All in the Family and MTMs The Mary Tyler Moore Show Mr Lear demonstrated that the form could deal effectively and even powerfully with subjects such as unemployment or abortion The MTM show turned into a firstrate ensemble effort supplemented with clever scripts that were the equivalent of superb oneact stage comedies In one of the more impressive transformations of the decade one of the Mary Tyler Moore Show spinoffs was Lou Grant which with Ed Asner in the title role became a weekly series tackling unusually serious issues Clearly the situation comedy is capable of quality But as with anything else concerning the entertainment arts achieving it isnt easy The TV record books are stuffed with the titles of failed sitcoms Then there are all those projects that never made it past the pilot stage A good many of these onetimeonly efforts are slipped almost surreptitiously into the summer schedule to relieve the reruns glut A few weeks ago for instance CBS offered One More Try which featured Lucie Arnaz and Laurence Luckinbill who are married in real life as a couple deciding to marry despite each having been divorced in previous unhappy experiences Miss Arnaz daughter of the Lucy in I Love Lucy and Mr Luckinbill whose acting credits are extensive are appealing performers They were determined to show how a certain kind of contemporary marriage in some ways similar to their own might work warts and all They tried hard The show just sat there and expired The setting was an apartment on Manhattans West Side not too far from his job at the American Museum of Natural History Problems were quickly apparent when one of the first characters on the scene turned out to be the buildings irascible elevator man He had what was supposed to be a funny Jewish accent The rest of the episode focused on the resistance of Mr Luckinbills two young sons to his plans for marriage Miss Arnaz I think they take things too seriously Concerned father You really have a sarcastic sense of humor A rather tedious scene had the two lovers illustrating the degree of their anger with each other by breaking dishes on the kitchen floor The argument was resolved at a local luncheonette where Mr Luckinbill announced to the unimpressed bystanders I believe love can conquer anything Later when the Wedding March was being played back in the apartment he couldnt resist saying Theyre playing our song a questionably cute reference to the Neil Simon play in which Miss Arnaz and Mr Luckinbill have toured extensively The shows theme song written and sung by Miss Arnaz chirped valiantly on about taming two egos being amigos but One More Try was beyond the help of even artificial respiration Admittedly it is unfair not to say risky to try to predict the future of a situation comedy on the basis of its first episode Some in the mode of One More Try seem quite obviously doomed Others tend to be borderline cases Perhaps the trickiest specimens are those that begin with a splashy bang The first episode is terrific and gets rave reviews The promise of a bright new series is never realized however as subsequent episodes falter on hackneyed scripts or unimaginative direction Two passing examples in this category were ABCs The Associates with Wilfrid HydeWhite as the crusty head of a distinguished law firm and CBSs The Two of Us with Mimi Kennedy and Peter Cook as a divorced career woman and her snobbish British butler Then there is the series that begins unimpressively and gradually as the cast begins to work like a repertory company and as the scripts become more assured turns into a project of surprising substance The prime example here is CBSs MASH which in the beginning suffered unfavorable comparisons with the Robert Altman film on which it was based The show began to discover a distinctive personality only during its second season and despite some major cast changes has gained in strength over the years further stretching the boundaries of the sitcom form the continuing inclusion of a laugh track however discreet keeps it in this category The producers insist that this will be the final season for MASH The challenge now is for television to come up with a series that might be its equal For despite its enormous casualty rate the situation comedy remains a vehicle of imposing variety and potential

The Issue Is Court-Stripping,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/20/opinion/the-issue-is-court-stripping.html,Last week a weary Senate finally tabled an antiabortion rider to the vital debt ceiling bill Today it decides whether to cut off debate on another legislative parasite on the same bill a school prayer rider This time the issue is far more than a politically sensitive social issue It is the structure of constitutional government If a filibuster by a number of committed Senators is the only way to make that point clear to their colleagues then the filibuster should continue Senator Jesse Helms who sponsored the rider believes the Supreme Court was wrong two decades ago in ruling that officially sponsored prayer violates the First Amendment But his rider would strip all the Federal courts including the Supreme Court of the power to rule at all in prayer controversies Passage of such a measure would provoke a constitutional crisis It would challenge the role of the Federal judiciary as interpreter of the Constitution  indeed as a coequal branch of the Government The proper way to overcome a Supreme Court constitutional ruling is by amending the Constitution That is the basis of Attorney General Smiths objection to legislative shortcuts President Reagan showed similar awareness when he called for a vote this year on the school prayer constitutional amendment he has proposed For good reason amending the Constitution is far more deliberate than passing a law It requires a twothirds vote of Congress and ratification by three fourths of the states The success of Mr Helmss measure would mean that a simple majority in Congress could render the Constitution unenforceable in Federal courts  and subject to varying interpretations in state courts Let the debate continue until the entire Senate understands and knows that the voters understand that the issue is not prayer but courtstripping
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/20/us/briefing-162720.html,Compromise on Arms Aides A fter weeks of secret political negotiations both sides have accepted a compromise that has ended a threat by Senator Jesse Helms to stage a Senate filibuster against the nominations of two officials of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Eugene V Rostow the agency director had stoutly defended the nominations of Robert Grey and Norman Terrell to the posts respectively of deputy director and assistant director In the end however the White House decided it did not want another political battle with conservatives and Mr Rostow was forced to accept the Senators offer to go along with Mr Greys nomination in return for the withdrawal of Mr Terrells As consolation prizes Mr Rostow will have Mr Grey a longtime personal friend at his side Senator Helms has added another political scalp to his collection and Mr Terrell the acting assistant director of the agencys bureau of nuclear and weapons control will be given what one senior Administration official described as an excellent job in another agency Mr Helms a North Carolina Republican had been holding up the appointments in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee while he tried to persuade the White House that the two officials both holdovers from the Carter Administration do not deserve the trust of the American people He judged them ideologically tainted and suggested that they had been involved in what Mr Helms viewed as an agency coverup of Soviet violations of arms control agreements It was not clear why Mr Helms finally decided that Mr Grey was politically acceptable but that Mr Terrell was not Abortion Rights Handbook A candidate who has difficulty articulating support for abortion rights under campaign pressure has just been given a powerful assist An independent political committee called Voters for Choice has produced a 150page handbook on the subject that anticipates almost any situation Suppose for example your opponent charges that the Bible regards abortion as a crime The handbook provides a citation from Exodus indicating that it was a civil offense unless the mother was harmed Or suppose you are asked if you support abortion on demand The handbook offers this answer No I believe that abortion is a matter of personal choice I dont believe that anyone demands an abortion A woman reaches the decision under difficult circumstances and with much anguish Voters for Choice is sending the publication as a campaign contribution to all Congressional candidates identified as sharing its position Others may buy copies for 35 Status Shirts I f you see an otherwise seedy Washingtonian around town sporting a new tennis shirt with a neat White House Press label dont automatically give him security clearance He may only be a friend of Joe Canzeri When Mr Canzeri was a deputy assistant to President Reagan he had some shirts made up with the rampant alligator emblem encircled by white capital letters identifying the wearer as a White House correspondent He distributed them to reporters covering the President on a California vacation but still had a supply when he resigned last February Now a private consultant here Mr Canzeri slipped a few of his shirts to friends and Georgetown neighbors Candidate for Energy T he leading candidate to succeed James B Edwards as Secretary of Energy is the Under Secretary of the Interior Donald T Hodel according to Reagan Administration sources Before joining the Interior Department early last year Mr Hodel served on the legal staff of the GeorgiaPacific Corporation as administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration and as a private consultant on energy Secretary Edwards is resigning later this year to become president of the Medical University of South Carolina Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr
POWER BALANCE IN FAVOR OF ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/20/us/power-balance-in-favor-of-abortion.html,Twenty months ago when the current Congress came to town the legions of the New Right were vowing to reverse the Supreme Court decision of 1973 that legalized abortion Supporters of that decision had suffered stunning defeats in the 1980 elections and the antiabortion movement was being hailed as a potent force in American politics They certainly had us all on the run in January of 1981 said William W Hamilton Jr director of the Washington office of Planned Parenthood a leading advocate of abortion rights But last week the Senate voted to kill a proposal by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would have seriously restricted freedom of choice on abortion At a news conference on Friday Mr Hamilton said of Mr Helms For all his huffing and puffing we now see that the emperor has no clothes For the last decade abortion has been a wrenching and polarizing subject the sort of issue that sends partisans on both sides into the streets convinced of their rectitude and righteousness And the battle is hardly over since abortion foes have promised to continue their fight when Congress reconvenes next year But no matter how future frays are resolved it is clear that the balance of power on the abortion issue has shifted significantly The forces favoring abortion rights are no longer on the run they have taken the high ground and they control the battlefield A Personal Issue The most important reason for their success is that in virtually every public opinion poll voters have backed their position by a 2 to 1 margin So the Senators were reflecting the views of their constituents when they buried the Helms proposal During the 1980 campaign abortion was debated in abstract terms President Reagan and other conservatives capitalized on the widespread feeling that abortion along with crime drugs and pornography symbolized a certain moral collapse in the country But when Senator Helms advanced specific legislation it was widely perceived not as a conservative measure but a radical one People see abortion as a personal issue and not one on which government should be legislating said Jo Blum a lobbyist for the Alan Guttmacher Institute an arm of Planned Parenthood Moreover the political climate since the 1980 elections has changed markedly Many Democrats who were attracted to the Republicans on the basis of social issues such as abortion now fear for their jobs Economic issues dominate the public agenda and as one aide to the Republican leadership put it Abortion is something most Senators wish would go away Question of Legal Procedure When we finally brought it up the aide explained we discovered very quickly that even those who feel strongly about abortion didnt feel the time was right Its hard to say to your constituents we let interest rates go up while we debated abortion The antiabortion forces were also vulnerable because Senator Helmss bill tried in effect to alter the Constitution through a simple statute rather than by a formal amendment To lawyers and judges across the country this approach violated the most basic notions of proper legal procedure as a result the legal establishment joined the fray on the side of those favoring abortion rights The Helms approach also caused a split among those opposed to abortion A rival faction led by Senator Orrin G Hatch and the Roman Catholic bishops favored a Constitutional amendment and the two sides dissipated a lot of energy battling for power and prominence With the antiabortion forces thus weakened the abortion rights camp decided to change political tactics On the Senate floor a band of liberal and moderate lawmakers who had shunned the filibuster weapon in the past decided to use it A Matter of Good Politics We showed that we would do anything that we would use any procedural device to block legislation said David Landau of the American Civil Liberties Union Even so they faced a major political problem No matter what the polls showed many lawmakers believed that opponents of abortion would cast votes and give money based on that issue alone Voters favoring the right to abortion according to the conventional wisdom cared about many issues and were less motivated by a candidates position on abortion We had to be able to prove that in 1982 the prochoice position was good politics said Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League In order to do that the coalition of abortion rights groups borrowed tactics long used by those on the right and generated a grass roots letterwriting campaign to members of Congress They also started political action committees and raised campaign cash to take one example the National Abortion Rights Action League has already contributed 300000 to candidates around the country Presidents Visible Role The result was that more Senators than ever before were willing to risk the wrath of those opposed to abortion Maybe the singleissue groups are losing some of their sting said one Senate Republican aide Senators are now willing to stand up to them and say We shouldnt be doing this You wouldnt find that before President Reagan and his advisers apparently made a different calculation and decided that for the President to take a visible antiabortion stand was good politics this fall But Senator Bob Packwood who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee called the Presidents campaign strategy another nail in the coffin of the Republican Party Moreover Senator Packwood noted Mr Reagan has less clout on the abortion issue than on economics Voters feel the matter so personally and lawmakers face it so often that their positions are welldefined and not so subject to Presidential persuasion But because abortion is an issue that all sides feel so keenly about it will certainly be back next year As Patricia A Gavett executive director of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights put it We are not about to assume that the issue has been settled for we know it has not been
"WITH ELECTION DAY LOOMING, 'JITTERS' FILL THE HALLS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/21/us/with-election-day-looming-jitters-fill-the-halls.html,Everybodys got the jitters You can feel it in the air Lets face it nothing of substance is going to happen around here until after the election No one knows whos going to be here next year and whos going to leave The rumors are feeding on themselves Its like Dodge City Everyones looking over his shoulder A discernible mood of uneasiness has pervaded the White House recently reflected by these and other random comments from aides to President Reagan It is due in part to the fact that there is more to focus on than the economic issues that held the Administration together for 20 months Mr Reagan has been seeing foreign visitors conferring on national security matters and demanding action from Congress on a variety of issues But the primary concern of his staff nowadays is on the election campaign Senior aides admit that several crucial policy questions have been put on hold James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff was said to have directed staff members not to talk or even speculate with reporters about how Mr Reagan might handle some of the tough issues facing him after the election No Talk of Social Security Take Social Security for instance Mr Reagan is all but certain to embrace proposals for at least some new trims in benefits once his bipartisan panel studying the subject comes up with its recommendations after the election In the meantime one adviser said the staff has been ordered not to talk about the subject A couple of weeks ago the President met with the panel of businessmen and outside economists serving on his economic policy advisory board Those at the meeting said that some of the participants discussed the idea of raising taxes further next year to help close the Federal deficit It was not a popular idea with the President one official recalled with considerable understatement He indicated that taxes and further budget cuts were being studied by the Office of Management and Budget but that senior White House aides were deliberately keeping themselves in the dark about such things in the political season Another top Reagan aide shuddered about the issues piling up for postelection consideration He forecast blood on the floor for instance when the ongoing internal battles over military spending are replayed later this year when Mr Reagan puts his budget submission together for next January Tension in the Air Shoving so many issues aside has left time for the White House to focus instead on the social issues aimed at galvanizing support for Republicans in November These incude abortion school prayer tuition tax credits and other matters that have been peripheral until now A senior Presidential adviser said that some of the tension in the air seemed to flow from everybodys heightened sensitivity to the issues as the November election approached with its potential of inflicting a damaging blow to Mr Reagans base of support on Capitol Hill But another ingredient seems to be the obvious discomfort over the social issues with certain officials who dont identify themselves personally with the religious right of the Republican Party These officials speak firmly of how important the social issues are for Mr Reagan There is no evidence that anyone is making less than an allout effort on them On the other hand no one is arguing that the future of the country lies in the balance More than a trace of ambivalence on the abortion issue in particular exists in the west wing of the White House It is no secret that the wives of some of the Presidents men as well as some of the younger female aides personally favor the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion Like a PingPong Ball A diffuseness in the White House legislative operation was apparent last week with the publication of Mr Reagans list of eight separate measures constituting his agenda of legislative priorities in the next few weeks Their sheer range and number seems to be taxing the resources of the staff in new ways Sometimes I feel like a PingPong ball running around asking about whats the status of this and the status of that said one Presidential aide He sounded as if he yearned for the days when Mr Reagan could concentrate on simple broad themes in dealing with Congress Perhaps inevitably much of the staff time these days is spent speculating on whether Mr Reagan will make any major personnel changes next year David R Gergen assistant to the President for communications fueled the talk when he told reporters recently that fresh blood might do the White House some good next year However he said he didnt think there would be a purge either at the White House or in the Cabinet Like a Poison His comment did not go unnoticed by some conservatives at the White House who privately feel Mr Baker hurt the President by getting him to support taxincrease legislation last month It was like a poison that entered into the body of Ronald Reagan said one of them I can understand the reasons for it but its just hard for someone like me to take One senior official said he was personally convinced that all four of Mr Reagans top aides would remain next year Mr Baker Edwin Meese 3d Michael K Deaver and William P Clark Of these only Mr Deaver has said that he plans to leave although most people feel that he could be persuaded to stay But there has always been talk that either Mr Baker or Mr Meese the White House counselor could be moved over to the Justice Department if for example Attorney General William French Smith leaves People are praying for the long life and good health of the Attorney General said a Reagan aide As long as hes in place theres a plug in the bathtub If he goes nobody knows whatll happen around here
POLL HINTS DEMOCRATS COULD MAKE KEY GAINS IN THE HOUSE ELECTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/22/us/poll-hints-democrats-could-make-key-gains-in-the-house-elections.html,With six weeks until the elections economic concerns rather than social issues dominate voting intentions and Democrats are preferred over Republicans in Congressional races by a wide margin the latest New York Times CBS News Poll shows The Democratic edge appears big enough if it lasts until Nov 2 to end President Reagans working control of the House of Representatives The Republican campaign treasury the quality of individual campaigns foreign crises or a run of good economic news could alter the picture reflected last week in the poll of 1305 registered voters But the survey showed that 54 percent of those surveyed backed or leaned toward Democrats in the Congressional elections and 38 percent sided with Republicans GOP Vulnerable on Economy Critical views of Mr Reagan and his party on the economy dominated the polls findings Among registered voters 61 percent said they would trust Congress more on handling the economy than they would Mr Reagan Twentynine percent preferred Mr Reagan Twothirds of the public continues to feel that prices are going up as fast as or faster than they were a year ago despite Republican arguments that the rate of inflation has been cut Mr Reagans party continues to be regarded as much less effective than the Democrats in coping with unemployment providing a fair budget or making the right decisions on Social Security Converting national vote totals into aggregates for the 435 House races cannot be done precisely but such a margin would probably mean a Democratic gain of nearly 40 seats party leaders said The House now has 241 Democrats and 192 Republicans with two Democratic seats vacant but the Reagan Administration has won many key rollcalls by fewer than two dozen votes with near unanimous support from Republicans critical to those victories Republicans appeared to be in particular trouble where they count most on winning in districts in which Republican incumbents are running Among respondents to the poll in Republican districts Democrats were preferred 47 percent to 43 percent In 1980 Republicans who won contested races averaged 65 percent of the votes in their districts Democrats held a lead of 60 percent to 32 percent in Democratic districts a ratio like their average share of 67 percent in the districts their party won in 1980 In the 58 open districts those with no incumbent candidate the responses divided almost equally 47 percent Republican and 45 percent Democratic The Republican districts while more approving of Mr Reagans Presidency than is the rest of the nation still had more Democrats than Republicans The poll suggested that Democrats in those districts who defected to Mr Reagans party in the 1980 recession were coming back to their party perhaps because of this years recession Nevertheless Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee said he was not disturbed He said the advantages of campaign money and incumbency which have enabled all Republican Congressional incumbents except one to avoid defeat in primaries this year could be used by those Republican members to overcome abstract preferences for Democrats He said Republican gains had to come in the open seats and thus the finding that the parties were even in that area was overwhelmingly good news Democrats Encouraged Patrick H Caddell a top Democratic polltaker disagreed saying many Republican seats were loosely held You lose elections when the election is fought on your own base said the man who was President Carters polltaker in 1980 and in a lot of those bluecollar Democratic seats they won in 1980 the Republican base is very small On many major national issues the poll indicated little change in public opinion over the summer with 42 percent of all 1664 respondents registered and unregistered saying they approved Mr Reagans handling of his job In the May TimesCBS News Poll 43 percent approved The Presidents standing among women improved as the fear of Mr Reagan as a leader who might involve the country in a war subsided while his standing among men worsened On the question of their Congressional vote women preferred Democrats over Republicans 55 percent to 36 percent and men backed them but more narrowly 53 percent to 40 percent When opinions on those issues were correlated with voting preferences it was clear that economic issues were pivotal Other concerns from a proposed nuclear freeze to official sanctioning of school prayer to banning abortion had no significant relation to national partisan preferences SingleIssue Attitudes Mr Reagan has been hammering hard recently on abortion and prayer as advisers explain that he is seeking to solidify the support of restive conservatives The poll suggested that his concern might be exaggerated When asked Whether or not you agree with him do you think Ronald Reagan has kept his promise to govern as a conservative 59 percent of selfstyled conservatives said yes Fiftyfive percent of the public as a whole did so too The poll also indicated a major change in the focus of one element of the electorate the singleissue voter In recent years voters willing to desert party loyalties over one issue frequently abortion have assumed an increasing weight in the nations politics In the latest poll fully 48 percent of the registered respondents answered yes when asked Is there any one issue that is so important that you would change your vote because you disagreed with a candidates position on that single issue Just as in a 1978 poll by CBS News 7 percent of the respondents singled out abortion But the nature of the group had changed significantly In 1978 the group citing this issue was opposed to abortion by a margin of more than 4 to 1 This years group by a ratio of 3 to 2 favored choice on the abortion question The registered voters polled opposed by more than 2 to 1 the concept of a constitutional amendment which would make abortion illegal nationwide This finding indicated that the abortion issue was not likely to be the same kind of political explosive this year that it was in 1978 Gauging the Abortion Issue Attitudes on abortion were reflected in two ways In addition to the rejection of a nationwide ban 68 percent to 28 percent the public appeared to be evenly divided with 47 percent favoring and 46 percent opposing an amendment which would give individual states the right to outlaw abortions statewide Such a proposal has been discussed in Congress but it has been opposed by ardent foes of abortion as well as supporters of abortion choice On some issues public opinion did seem to run with Mr Reagan Sixtysix percent of the registered voters said they would favor an amendment to the Constitution that would permit organized prayer in public schools Twentynine percent were opposed Fiftyseven percent of registered voters as against 53 percent in May said they believed the Presidents economic program eventually will help the economy Thirty percent as against 29 percent in June said it would eventually hurt Mr Reagans efforts to bring peace to the Middle East before his decision Monday to send marines back to Lebanon may have helped both his and his partys standing on the issue of war Thirtyfive percent of all 1664 people interviewed said they feared he will get us into a war In May 41 percent voiced that fear but the question then used the word might not will But it did not appear from other questions that the wording change had made any difference Fears on the Economy But economics dominated the responses Fifty percent of the registered respondents said Democrats would do better at preparing a fair budget and of that group more than 5 to 1 said they would favor Democrats in their Congressional voting Thirtytwo percent said the Republicans would do better on a fair budget and in that group Republican candidates were preferred 4 to 1 Fiftyseven percent said they disapproved of Mr Reagans handling of the economy That contingent split 4 to 1 for Democrats The 37 percent who said they approved divided about 3 to 1 for the Republicans These correlations helped point up Republican problems in retaining Republicanheld seats In the 161 Republican districts Mr Reagans rating on the economy was close to that of his national standing with 37 percent approving and 54 percent disapproving The latest New York Times CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from Sept 13 to Sept 18 with 1664 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii Of this total 1305 said they were registered voters The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen in such a way as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The results have been weighted to take account of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory it can be said that in 95 cases out of 100 the results based on the entire sample differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger depending on the number of sample cases in the subgroup The theoretical errors do not take into account a margin of additional error resulting from the various practical difficulties in taking any survey of public opinion Assisting The Times in its 1982 survey coverage is Dr Irving Crespi of Irving Crespi  Associates a survey consulting firm
SCHOOL PRAYER ADVOCATES LOSE THIRD VOTE IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/23/us/school-prayer-advocates-lose-third-vote-in-senate.html,Tensions generated by a 20month struggle between liberals and conservatives flared on the Senate floor today as the lawmakers refused for the third straight day to cut off a filibuster against a bill that would permit officially endorsed prayer in public schools The vote was 54 to 46 six votes short of the 60 needed to limit debate However the political appeal of the school prayer issue was demonstrated when the Senate also refused 53 to 47 to kill the bill which has been offered as a rider to legislation raising the national debt ceiling That second vote left the Senate in legislative gridlock as Senator Howard H Baker Jr put it but the majority leader vowed to resolve the impasse quickly probably on Thursday As proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina the legislation now being filibustered would legalize sanctioned prayer by removing the issue from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts Even many supporters of the bill admit it is doomed for this session of Congress Political Motive Is Seen Many Senators believe that Mr Helms with the encouragement of the White House has pushed the issue this far for political reasons They both resent and fear the prospect of Mr Helms and his conservative allies using their votes against sanctioned school prayer in future campaigns This anger against Mr Helms boiled over when Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas took the floor and declared in public what many colleagues have been saying in private It is my belief this is all political the Arkansan said It has been since the first cloture vote I understand his presses are running Mr Bumpers said of Mr Helms His letters are going out What political advantage can there possibly be in getting people on the record 10 times instead of nine Equally angry Mr Helms retorted I have sat silent for all sorts of abuse against those who favor prayer in schools The Senator insisted that the American people want prayer in schools and that his purpose was to get it for them Defeat of Abortion Bill Since the start of the current Congress Mr Helms has been pushing for a debate on social issues primarily abortion and school prayer His bill to ban abortions was defeated last week and now that his school prayer initiative also seems dead many analysts are saying that Mr Helms has lost some of his political power both inside and outside the Senate Senator John P East Mr Helmss fellow Republican from North Carolina acknowledged those comments today but said that such conclusions were wrong Out in the land the people are with him Mr East said of Mr Helms Much of the criticism has focused on the bills proposal to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction on prayer issues Most Senators said Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana know that it is unsound and perhaps unconstitutional The problem is that in their homestates this is not perceived as a courtstripping bill its perceived as a school prayer bill DAmato Supports Cloture Todays vote by 54 senators to end the filibuster was one more than on Tuesday The lone switcher was Senator John C Stennis Democrat of Mississippi As in previous votes the only Senator from the New York metropolitan area to support cloture was Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York On the tabling motion Mr DAmato was again the only local lawmaker to side with Mr Helms On Thursday Senate leaders are expected to move that the debt ceiling bill be returned to committee and reported back with no amendments That maneuver would effectively end all debate and allow the Senate to pass a simple extension of the debt ceiling which has already passed the House Without it the Government could run out of borrowing authority at the end of the month
STATE SEEKING ABORTION FOR A RETARDED WOMAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/23/nyregion/state-seeking-abortion-for-a-retarded-woman.html,In a highly unusual case lawyers from the New York State Attorney Generals office won a court order last night in an effort to reverse a court decision that denies an abortion for a retarded 25yearold woman with the mental age of a 1 12yearold child Upon discovering the womans pregnancy last month the state with the consent of her parents decided she should not have the baby and asked the court to approve an abortion on the grounds that the pregnancy was a threat to her life Judge William J Deeley refused approval in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Sept 9 on the grounds that her pregnancy did not pose a threat to her life Richard Rifkind a deputy first assistant attorney general said last night that the state lawyers were seeking a court order to have the case reheard today in State Supreme Court and to have an abortion approved New Grounds for Abortion He said they would present new grounds for the abortion based on the fact that the woman is incompetent and that the state and her parents are issuing their consent for an abortion Mr Rifkin said that Justice Arthur Blyn signed an order at 1030 last night scheduling a hearing on the issue in State Supreme Court in brooklyn As a consequence the issue of the womans abortion is to come up before Judge Deeley this afternoon Its a very complex legal issue Mr Rifkind said I dont think it has ever come up before The woman has an IQ of 12 and has an acute form of tuberous sclerosis a syndrome that caused her retardation She is said to be between 20 and 22 weeks pregnant and Dr William Rashbaum the physician to whom the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities referred the woman for an abortion said that any delay beyond today would have tragic consequences His patient is referred to in court papers only as Barbara because the state never identifies its mentally disabled patients A law clerk said that Judge Deeley was on a prison inspection tour yesterday and could not be reached for comment on whether he would grant a rehearing He is hearing criminal cases even though he is on the Court of Claims According to state officials the judges ruling was based only on the narrow threat to life issue presented by state lawyers The same lawyers acknowledged that they might have had a better chance of success if they had sought an abortion on the ground of consent To do this they would have to introduce the consent of the state and of Barbaras parents in her behalf According to Dr Sidney Austein chief of medical services at the states Brooklyn Developmental Center where Barbara is a patient we have never seen a case like hers before He said the center did not know the circumstances under which she became pregnant Dr Rashbaum said he could perform a relatively uncomplicated abortion procedure if it was done immediately while his patient was still in her second trimester of pregnancy  the fourth through the sixth month of pregnancy  one that would induce the process of labor in his patient Dr Rashbaum who is cochairman of the New York Chapter of Physicians for Abortion Rights also said that the chances were likely that Barbara would deliver a defective child if her pregnancy was not terminated He said there was a 50 percent chance of defect because of her genetically transmitted condition and because the drug she was regularly receiving to prevent convulsions was known to cause severe birth defects Dr Rashbaum said he examined the woman for the first time on Tuesday I cannot understand why the state took so long in getting her to me he said Barbara is a patient in a group home for the retarded maintained by the Brooklyn Developmental Center in the boroughs Sunset Park section Because she is classified as incompetent court approval is required for any elective surgery to be performed on her According to officials Barbara can walk by herself but has difficulty feeding herself and remaining continent Delay in Seeking Approval Both the center and Barbaras parents consented to an abortion five weeks before Sept 9 But no official could explain last night why the decision to seek one was delayed until that date or why another attempt to gain approval for an abortion was delayed even further Dr Austein said he was the only witness at the Sept 9 proceeding He said he had testified that the woman was profoundly retarded and suffered from epileptic seizures and that an extended pregnancy could create grave problems For example he said if the drug to prevent her seizures was withdrawn in the interests of protecting the fetus there would be no way to control her convulsions But he said he had evidently failed to offer enough evidence to prove that the pregancy represented a threat to her life According to Mr Rifkind state law requires that an abortion can be performed with the consent of the mother only within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy After that he said an abortion can only be performed if the life of the mother is threatened
"ABORTION FOR WOMAN, 25, WITH I.Q. OF 12 ALLOWED",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/nyregion/abortion-for-woman-25-with-iq-of-12-allowed.html,An acting justice in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn yesterday authorized an abortion to be performed on profoundly retarded 25yearold woman after accepting the consent of her parents as a substitute for the consent of their daughter The ruling by Judge William J Deeley came two weeks after he had denied an abortion for the woman on the ground that the state had woefully failed to prove that her pregnancy was a threat to her life Judge Deeley authorized the abortion to proceed and the woman was admitted to a hospital last night with the abortion scheduled for tomorrow Believed to Be First of Kind I dont want my daughter to suffer anymore than she has the womans father said after the court ruled on his consent I think Ive done the best thing I could do for her Lawyers involved in the case in the small crowded courtroom said they believed the ruling was the first in New York in which parental consent for an abortion was substituted for the consent a person judged legally not competent to make the decision The woman referred to only as Barbara because the court requested that her identity not be made public suffers from tuberous sclerosis a genetic syndrome that causes mental deficiency and epileptic seizures Witnesses said she had the mental age of 1 year and 11 months and an IQ of 12 The woman has been institutionalized for 22 years and officials in charge of her care at the states Brooklyn Developmental Center said they did not know under what circumstances she became pregnant 22 weeks ago Basis of Original Argument Five weeks ago they referred her to Dr William Rashbaum for an abortion and applied to State Supreme Court in Brooklyn for permission State law requires court approval for any major surgical procedure on incompetent patients Since the officials did not have any consent from the woman the centers medical director argued in court on Sept 9 that the pregnancy was lifethreatening But Judge Deeley denied approval and said the state had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its argument At the time the parents had already given their consent But the issue before the judge was confined to whether the pregnancy was lifethreatening  the issue of consent never came up In petitioning the court for a new hearing lawyers from the State Attorney Generals office adopted a new legal strategy arguing that the woman was constitutionally entitled to an abortion even though she was incompetent to give her consent for one Requirements for Abortion According to New York law the only legal requirements for an abortion in the first trimester  the first 12 weeks of pregnancy  are that the woman consent to it and that it be performed by a licensed physician In the second trimester from 12 to 24 weeks the same conditions apply only the abortion must be performed in a hospital After 24 weeks an abortion can be performed only if a pregnancy is deemed to be lifethreatening Sall J Sidoti an assistant state attorney general appearing in behalf of the developmental center argued that since the woman was still within the second trimester the only issue for second trimester the only issue for the court to decide is one of consent He said that since the woman was incapable of giving it then her parents were the only ones who could Her Father Is Called to Stand With that Mr Sidoti called to the stand the womans father and asked him if he believed his daughter should have an abortion Yes I do the father replied My daughter doesnt understand whats happening to herself  Im afraid shell hurt herself punch herself I cant see making her suffer anymore At first Mr Sidoti was reluctant to call the womans mother to stand because she was close to tears But Judge Deeley reassured her and asked her if she agreed with her husband Yes she answered Are you certain the judge said Oh yes she said While abortion is covered by the criminal statutes Mr Sidoti said that the office of the Brooklyn District Attorney was submitting a statement to the judge authorizing Mr Sidoti to plead for the abortion Although the deciding issue was one of consent Judge Deeley allowed witnesses to describe the condition of the pregnant woman Linda Jones a psychologist at the center said that the woman was very very frightened and that going through with the pregnancy would be emotionally traumatic for her Shell be in labor and she wont understand what the pain is all about she said Sees It as Extremely Cruel Dr Rashbaum who was the next witness said that to allow the pregnancy to continue would be extremely curel He also said that her condition and the fact that she was taking an anitconvulsant drug raised the strong possibility of a defective child At that Mr Sidoti interrupted and said that the condition of the fetus was not an issue But Judge Deeley stopped him and said Lets let it all hang out Dennis Feld a lawyer appearing as a guardian for the woman in behalf of the Mental Health Information Service an arm of the court opposed the states argument for parental consent He argued that only the court could give consent for an abortion and he asked the court to deny the states petition At that point Mr Sidoti recalled Dr Rashbaum to the stand and asked him why an immediate decision was necessary Dr Rashbaum said that if an abortion were not started immediately the woman would have to be subjected to medically accepted procedures for thirdtrimester abortions which involve inducing labor Subjecting this little frightened child to such a traumatic experience would be more than unfair he said
SCHOOL PRAYER MEASURE DIES IN 51-48 SENATE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/us/school-prayer-measure-dies-in-51-48-senate-vote.html,The conservative campaign to promote its agenda of social issues collapsed today as the Senate voted to shelve a proposal that would permit officially sanctioned school prayer For almost two years the Senate leadership has been promising conservatives a fulldress debate on their agenda which includes the banning of abortions and school busing for racial integration as well as school prayer But those bills were never able to overcome the filibuster tactics of Congressional liberals who have mastered the legislative arts of delay and obstruction and today the Senate ended debate on the topics for this session At some point this has to end Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader told the Senate And this is that point Helms Makes One More Effort Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican who has spearheaded the social issues campaign made one last attempt to end the weeklong liberal filibuster and attach his school prayer rider to a bill raising the national debt ceiling He lost 51 to 48 with Senator Baker casting a key vote against him On a subsequent procedural move the prayer measure was officially killed by a vote of 79 to 16 Then the Senate passed a debt ceiling bill which enabled the Federal Government to continue borrowing money by 50 to 41 Senator Dan Quayle an Indiana Republican also abandoned Senator Helms on the critical vote and later explained Its time we got on with other things Enough is enough Not a single item on the social issue agenda became law in this Congress and legislators today offered many explanations from the overriding importance of economic concerns to the adroit strategies of Congressional liberals But the main reason appears to have been that the basically moderate nature of the American political character reasserted itself while the Helms proposals were seen as radical and disruptive Centrists Still in Contol The centrists are still in control on these issues said Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland Later Senator Helms conceded defeat and said it would be an exercise in futility to push his bills any more this year But he promised to renew his fight when the new Congress convened in January and to put to liberals to a stiffer test This year he said they got away with a Cadillac filibuster against his bills but next year he said they would have to stay up all night to stop him In the current session Senator Baker repeatedly urged Senator Helms to hold off the social issues while Congress dealt with pressing economic concerns Today the North Carolina Republican said his accommodation had been a tactical mistake and he vowed to push his program earlier in the next Congress Mr Helms also had a harsh word for the Reagan White House which focused mainly on economic matters in the last 20 months and only recently took up the cause of the social issues I dont know one single vote the White House obtained for us in any of the social issue fights Senator Helms said He Says He Needs More Votes He acknowledged that the conservative cause needed more horses in Congress to prevail next year He also made clear that he and his allies would use the recent votes on social issues to attack liberals in the fall campaign in an attempt to bolster conservative ranks Liberal opponents of the social issues are also preparing for another battle next year It would be foolish to believe weve seen the end of the social issues said John Shattuck Washington director of the American Civil Liberties Union But weve weathered a very powerful storm here Weve shown that there is a Bill of Rights lobby out there and that we could win when the chips are down The first social issue to reach the floor was a proposal to ban most school busing for racial integration It passed the Senate after a 10month fight but was buried by the House Judiciary Committee A measure that would have overturned Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion was buried by the Senate last week The bill that died today would have removed school prayer from the jurisdiction of Federal courts which have repeatedly ruled that sanctioned prayer violates the barrier between church and state enshrined in the Constitution Tenacity of the Liberals One reason for the demise of this legislation was the tenacity of Senate liberals led by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut who outmanuvered the conservatives at almost every turn Moreover a wide range of organizations from the American Bar Association to abortion rights activists organized grass roots lobbying efforts against the social agenda and neutralized some of the political and financial power of the right By the end of the debate Senator Helmss reputation had suffered significantly and Senator Quayle said It might be more of a liability to be with Senator Helms than against him The liberal cause was strengthened by the decision of the conservatives to avoid constitutional amendments and press their cause through legislation seeking to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction in controversial matters This approach angered even some conservative legislators who agreed with Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware when he observed today In the crunch the Constitution always wins Roots of Election Discussed After the 1980 elections conservatives asserted that they had taken control of Congress and had a mandate to enact their social issue program but that claim was not upheld Senator Helms acknowledged today that he could count only 35 good solid conservatives in the Senate and even some of those said that the North Carolinian had misread the election results of 1980 I think Ronald Reagan was elected because of the disastrous economic conditions he inherited from Jimmy Carter said Senator Quayle not on the social issues Moreover with the continuing slump in the economy many felt that their constituents cared more about jobs and interest rates than school busing and abortion Some Republicans facing reelection campaigns this fall privately urged the leadership to end the social issue debate because they felt it was costing them support with the voters back home
"REAGAN IN CAMPAIGN SHIFT, PLANS LESS EMPHASIS ON THE SOCIAL ISSUES",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/us/reagan-in-campaign-shift-plans-less-emphasis-on-the-social-issues.html,President Reagans advisers in a shift of election strategy say they have come to recognize that abortion and other social issues do not have a nationwide impact on voters and therefore should be stressed only to selected audiences The shift in strategy came to light as the conservative campaign to promote an agenda of social issues in Congress collapsed today when the Senate voted to shelve legislation that would have allowed officially sanctioned prayer in public schools Page A19 In interviews the Presidential advisers said they recognized the validity of various national polls such as the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll showing that social issues would have little effect on an electorate increasingly concerned about the recession In addition some Presidential aides said Mr Reagan might have stirred resentment among some voters by being seen as trying to divert attention from the economy by stressing such issues as abortion school prayer crime and tuition tax credits There is only one issue to talk about out there and thats the economy a Reagan aide said Social policy and foreign policy dont make a blip and the President will be talking about them less We have got to talk about creating jobs especially if we go above 10 percent unemployment next month The defeat of the school prayer measure followed a similar Senate action last week killing an antiabortion bill In both cases a filibuster by Senate liberals proved successful in blocking the measures The school prayer measure proposed by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina was offered as a rider to a bill raising the ceiling on the national debt It was defeated 51 to 48 with the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee casting a key vote against the measure The defeats were regarded as significant in that the White House had hoped to obtain approval by the Republicancontrolled Senate on these and other measures knowing that the Democraticcontrolled House of Representatives would be disinclined to move on them The President wants to make the point before appropriate audiences that the Democratic House of Representative has bottled up a number of his initiatives a White House official said Then he can ask voters to give him a Republican House on Election Day To this official and others Mr Reagans plan to emphasize social issues will thus be geared not to nationwide audiences but to specific groups that can be galvanized to help Republican candidates in certain districts These include Roman Catholic voters in urban centers and religious fundamentalists in the border states and the Deep South according to White House aides They said emphasis on the issues was also important to instill enthusiasm among the troops who may work for Republican candidates because of their specific concerns Because of the importance of these groups White House aides discounted any suggestion that Mr Reagan would drop his reference to social issues altogether But they said the emphasis would be given to selected audiences Several White House aides acknowledged for example that the abortion issue seemed to be hurting the President among voters as much as it was helping him The New York Times CBS News Poll seemed to confirm this in that it found a considerable number of voters who favored abortion rights Evidence of House Resistance Two other issues that Mr Reagan has pushed in the Senate are tax credits for families sending children to private or parochial schools and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget The tax credits bill has cleared the Senate Finance Committee and the budgetbalancing amendment has been passed by the Senate Again White House aides said these issues were being aimed as evidence that the House was bottling up the Reagan initiatives On economic matters the Presidents legislative strategy is not terribly different according to White House aides Today for example Mr Reagan appealed to Congress to enact a new jobtraining bill for unemployed Americans The bill includes money for training but Democrats oppose the measure because it has no money to provide jobs themselves The bill has been in a HouseSenate conference committee for months as Democrats and Republicans debate their differences

CHALLENGE TO HELMS BUILDS IN CAROLINA,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/us/challenge-to-helms-builds-in-carolina.html,Losing the legislative battle for school prayer may have damaged Jesse Helmss standing as a national conservative leader but an even more serious problem awaits the Republican Senator in his home state The stakes here are longterm political survival for Senator Helms and for Gov James B Hunt Jr the 45yearold Democrat who yearns to supplant Mr Helms as the North Carolinian of consequence on the national political scene Using the political tools of his office Governor Hunt has organized the state Democratic party and a network of state employees and appointees into an antiHelms machine Its immediate goal is to protect the states seven Democrats in the House of Representatives from the ultraconservative Republican challengers who were recruited and in large measure financed by Mr Helmss political action committee the National Congressional Club But the Hunt forces say bluntly that the Congressional battle is a warmup for a 1984 Senate race between Mr Hunt and Mr Helms Already it is an intensely personal struggle as was illustrated when Mr Hunt showed a visitor a letter inviting the Governor to address 700 teachers from fundamentalist church schools Spiciest Politics in Region These are Jesses people  do you think Ill go Mr Hunt asked Quickly he provided a combative answer to his question Damn right I will I wont get them but Ill neutralize them North Carolina having contended for years that it has the Southeasts most decorous and progressive politics now has among the spiciest politics in the region and is more important as a trendsetter of the New Right than for the New South All factions agree that responsibility for this shift must go to Mr Helms He is the conservative movement in North Carolina said Thomas F Ellis the Raleigh lawyer who is Mr Helmss chief political aide We rise and fall on what he does and how he is perceived Mr Ellis added that the North Carolina public was not yet as aware as the states political insiders of the nature of the HelmsHunt struggle in this years Congressional elections In seeking to defeat Mr Helmss candidates this year and Mr Helms himself in 1984 the Democrats hope to kill the Republican threat to their control of the state end Mr Helmss national political career and provide a model for the defeat of New Right candidates in other states The outcome of this struggle depends largely on how well Mr Ellis uses the resources of what his critics call the National Congressional Club conglomerate This Raleighbased organization started out as a political action committee that raised 77 million for Mr Helmss 1976 election campaign Club Recruits Likely Candidates Now when it comes to Republican Party matters in North Carolina the club is the tail that wags the dog Through it Mr Ellis and others recruit Congressional candidates willing to run under the Helms banner as was Senator John P East then a political unknown in 1980 Legally the club can give each candidate only 10000 But it introduces them to wealthy supporters and provides national mailing lists of proven conservative contributors Enriched by outofstate money the candidates can then contract with the club at bargain prices for advertising polling and fundraising services Mr Ellis said these hightechnology campaigns were the only way Republicans could fight Mr Hunts deeprooted Democratic political machine Were a minority just like blacks he said Weve got to get in there and help one another or were going to get wiped out As Congressional candidates this year the club has favored political novices with celebrity appeal Jack Marin a former college and professional basketball star is opposing IT Valentine Jr a Democrat for an open seat Eugene McDaniel a retired Navy pilot who spent six years in a Vietnamese prison camp is running against Representative Charles O Whitley a Democratic incumbent William W Cobey Jr a former athletic director at the University of North Carolina is challenging a fiveterm Democratic incumbent Ike Andrews Anne Bagnel of WinstonSalem a Republican state senator who has opposed the proposed equal rights amendment is also getting club support for her Congressional race against the incumbent Stephen L Neal Republicans Hope for Fifth Seat The Republicans who hold four of the states 11 Congressional seats rate the Fourth District where Mr Cobey faces Mr Andrews as their best chance to gain a fifth Mr Cobeys is a classic Congressional Club campaign in its reliance on technology An aide said Mr Cobey makes only three or four speeches a week Meanwhile television advertisements crafted by the Congressional Clubs advertising subsidiary hammer at Ike Andrews and his liberal buddies in Congress and mass mailings remind voters that Mr Cobey is a Christian while Mr Andrews has wine bars at his receptions This assault from the Helms camp initially paralyzed Mr Andrews according to Democratic officials Then Mr Hunt stepped in gave Mr Andrews a sharptongued pep talk and installed some Hunt supporters in his campaign Using the muscle of his office Mr Hunt also set up a statewide organization Unity Campaign 82 to work for and prod his partys candidates National Democratic officials credit him with inspiring Mr Andrews and some other Democrats to fight the Helms organization instead of surrendering in the face of its superior technology and spirited attacks depicting Democrats as soft on social issues such as school prayer and abortion Caught Up in Ideology Mr Hunt wants Democrats to counterattack by suggesting that the Helms candidates are so caught up in ideology that they cannot deliver on practical issues such as preserving the tobacco crop subsidies that undergird the North Carolina economy To illustrate this approach the state Democratic party lampooned Mr Helms and Mr East as the tobacco tax twins when they supported higher cigarette taxes in the initial Senate vote on an Administration revenue bill As Mr Hunt dashes from one ailing campaign to the next he has the aspect of an overworked country doctor Sometimes his medicine is hyperbole as when he called Mr Whitley a lowkey Congressman from Mount Olive one of the most important respected Congressmen in this nation At other times Mr Hunt uses a dose of Democratic populism Noting that several Congressional Club candidates went to Houston seeking contributions Mr Hunt crowed But were not willing to go to Texas and get down on our knees before the big oil millionaires and ask for that kind of money Such talk may stir the Democratic campaign but not even Mr Hunts strongest supporters believe it will render Mr Helms a weakling by 1984 However Mr Hunt does seem to have inspired a sense of mission among them Its going to be beautiful even if we lose Phil Baddour Sr an antiHelms councilman in Goldsboro said of the 1984 race If youre going to fight you might as well fight the top dog
MRS.

SENATE MAKEUP ON SOCIAL ISSUES: 'CONSERVATIVE IT AIN'T'; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/25/us/senate-makeup-on-social-issues-conservative-it-ain-t-news-analysis.html,It was the end of a long and losing day and Jesse Helms was sipping coffee and talking about the Senate which had just handed him a string of defeats on his proposals to legalize school prayer and ban abortions Conservative it aint Republican it is said the North Carolina Republican the leader of the conservative cause on Capitol Hill Ive never said I had the votes to pass anything The failure of Mr Helms to enact any of his agenda of legislation on social issues in the current Congress tells something about a Senate that swung over to Republican control in 1980 for the first time in almost two decades After the election President Reagan proclaimed his conservative mandate and the vast changes that were coming in political life but it is now clear this assertion was probably overstated and certainly premature The long struggle over the social issues which first came to the Senate floor almost a year and a half ago also provided an illustration of the Senates singular institutional role Its practice of allowing unlimited debate means that the legislative branch moves very slowly most of the time and while this pace frustrates each of the lawmakers at one time or another it is also their greatest source of security Protection Against Whims Senator Patrick J Leahy a Vermont Democrat said of the filibuster rules They protect you against the whims of a temporary majority If its a true and lasting majority their program will eventually go through Moreover Senator Helmss opponents were bolstered by the growing sophistication of liberal lobbying groups which generated considerable grassroots sentiment against the social issue agenda and raised money to support candidates who voted with them The New Right is still pouring vast sums into political races around the country but the risk of opposing the New Right has been reduced That is exemplified by Senator Quentin N Burdick a North Dakota Democrat who is the target of a wellfinanced rightwing campaign this fall Mr Burdick consistently voted against Senator Helms on the social issues and he later said many candidates were now less fearful of the fallout from such votes than they were a year or two ago There are about a dozen moderate Republicans in the Senate and they stayed loyal to the President and the Republican leadership through the middle of this year But since the Republicans hold only a fourseat margin now the moderates have always had the potential of controlling the balance of power A few started showing some independence this year on economic issues but when the focus shifted to the social issues they defected from the party line in large numbers Senators Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut and Bob Packwood of Oregon led the filibusters on school prayer and abortion and they had strong support from such other Republicans as John H Chafee of Rhode Island and Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland On the key vote on Thursday 24 Republicans brushed aside President Reagans support for school prayer and voted to kill the Helms proposal Early Assessment Inaccurate Of the 18 Republicans elected to the Senate as freshmen in 1980 conventional wisdom held that about 15 were conservatives but as time passes that assessment is proving to be inaccurate The way the press read the elections of 1980 was wrong said Senator Slade Gorton a Washington Republican who is considered one of leading members of that group Most of us are economic conservatives but there arent more than four or five who could be characterized as members of the New Right On Thursday five Senators who had generally supported Senator Helms turned against him and gave his opponents their margin of victory Two were freshmen Republicans Dan Quayle of Indiana and Mark Andrews of North Dakota and Senator Quayle said later that in his view the Republican mandate of 1980 did not include the social issue agenda The media tended to overemphasize the importance of the social issues the Indiana Republican said And you can see this year that they have been unsuccessful I dont think there is a consensus on the issues they want added Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware The 1980 elections had nothing to do with them Opponents Publicized Issue This absence of a consensus gave liberals the chance to use the filibuster which has long been used mainly by conservatives to thwart civil rights legislation Not only did these delaying tactics hold up the social issues they also gave lobbying groups enough time to start publicizing the nature of these bills In particular these lobbyists stressed that the Helms approach relied on limiting the jurisdiction of the Federal courts and such a radical change was clearly outside the centrist consensus that dominates Congress on most issues As Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana put it A lot of Senators dont want to make an end run around the Constitution The filibusters against civil rights legislation succeeded until the demonstrations of the early 1960s galvinized public opinion and created the consensus necessary to overcome the conservative tactics Mr Helmss goal is to create that same sort of consensus behind his social issues and elect more horses to Congress who agree with him
REAGAN TERMS WOES DEMOCRATIC 'LEGACY',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/25/us/reagan-terms-woes-democratic-legacy.html,President Reagan delivering a spirited defense of his economic policies accused the Democrats today of mistaking compassion for practical solutions and insisted that voters still endorsed the sea change in American politics that he said his program had wrought Addressing a group of trade magazine editors at the White House Mr Reagan focused on the economic issue and described the current recession as a legacy of the years of spend and spend and tax and tax and even more Americans out of work Maybe its time to ask Speaker ONeill and the liberal leadership of his party if they really want a return to the policies that gave us a trilliondollar debt Mr Reagan declared referring to Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts the House Speaker in attacking the Democratic opposition in the Congressional elections this November Counterattack by Speaker Mr ONeill later counterattacked contending that Mr Reagans basic policy was to stand pat with an economic program that has already thrown millions out of work and threatens the jobs of millions more Both the President and the Speaker addressed the issue of rising unemployment and accused each other of using rival employment and jobtraining bills as ploys in the November elections In an aside Mr Reagan rejected reports that some of his political aides had decided to put aside such social issues as abortion and school prayer because of the increasing intensity of the economic issue in the minds of voters Denying that these were all somehow just a political gimmick Mr Reagan vowed to maintain his office as the nations bully pulpit Were not going to give up on those social issues that have to do with the morals of this country and the great standards that made this country great he said Even so the thrust of his remarks was directed at the economic issue and the Democrats and he credited his Administration with muting the voices of those who routinely called for Federal intervention wageandprice controls and billions for makework jobs Theres been a sea change in American politics Mr Reagan declared Even in Washington here where people seem to be realizing that you cant drink yourself sober or spend yourself rich that you cant prime the pump without pumping the prime To a considerable extent the separate remarks of the President and Speaker reflected the intensifying competition between the two parties as they stake out the unemployment issue for the fall Mr ONeill contended that the President was a latecomer to the issue He said that just as a proposal of Federal job aid for the elderly slipped by the President when he vetoed a recent budget bill so White House aides now feared that the jobs issue in the form of a public works bill approved by the Democraticcontrolled House would slip by to passage in the Republicancontrolled Senate Mr Reagan however dismissed that proposal for 200000 jobs as a temporary public makework program and praised instead a less expensive jobtraining proposal that is now at the conference stage in Congress He said the less costly measure would train a million people a year for jobs in the private sector Blames Democratic Solutions You might have noticed the rhetoric from our liberal critics already has reached a crescendo Mr Reagan said The trouble is that they call their compassion a solution The Democrats compassionate solution of a public jobs bill he said was a perfect example of why the nation is suffering from such deeprooted problems But the Democrats accused Mr Reagan of playing politics by emphasizing a bill that dealt solely with job training and does not create a single job for the unemployed President Reagan is trying to turn a retraining bill into a jobs bill Mr ONeill said Mr Reagan for his part asked Which is it going to be Tip Temporary or permanent Two hundred thousand or one million Makework or training for lasting jobs A political solution of spend and spend borrow and borrow or real economic opportunity for people looking to us for effective help and leadership Earlier the White House denied a report today in The New York Times that Mr Reagans advisers had shifted their political strategy away from the social issues and more toward the economic issue reflecting voters concerns in opinion polls Absolutely not said Larry Speakes the White House spokesman The commitment is strong But other Reagan advisers insisted that this was the case particularly with the Congressional defeat for now of several conservative proposals on social issues and with the departure soon of members of Congress to electioneer in their home districts The White House advisers asking not to be identified said today that the denial was issued to avoid any suggestion that Mr Reagan would drop discussion of social issues altogether They said Mr Reagan would continue to cite his stands on those issues before certain audiences but they repeated that he would be doing less of that once Congress left town in a week The aides also acknowledged that the whole matter of social issues was extremely sensitive and that Mr Reagan wanted to reassure supporters of his commitment after the appearance of The Times article
REAGAN REBUKES THOSE WHO SAY JOBLESSNESS AIDED INFLATION POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/us/reagan-rebukes-those-who-say-joblessness-aided-inflation-policy.html,President Reagan differing sharply with his nominee for chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers said today that it was the most cynical form of demagoguery to suggest that recent progress on inflation had contributed to unemployment In his weekly radio address Mr Reagan accused Democrats in Congress of exploiting helpless people for their own political gain by charging that our Administration fights inflation by putting people out of work Mr Reagan acknowledged that recent progress on inflation isnt easy for people to see because prices were continuing to rise But it hasnt gone up as much as it did in each of those last few years Mr Reagan said referring to inflation He then reminded listeners that inflation had been the No 1 issue of the 1980 Presidential campaign Denied Reliance on Unemployment The President used angry tones however in accusing Democrats of saying that his antiinflation policies had contributed to joblessness He made no reference to a similar statement by Martin S Feldstein his selection as chairman of the economic advisory panel On Wednesday Mr Feldstein a former professor of economics at Harvard University was critical of Administration promises made in 1981 that inflation could be reduced painlessly In a Senate hearing on his confirmation for the economic post Mr Feldstein said Extremists among both the supplysiders and monetarists who predicted that inflation would be reduced without raising unemployment have been decisively proven wrong The supplysiders Mr Feldstein referred to were those who said last year that a threeyear tax cut would produce economic growth without inflation Monetarists was a reference to those favoring a policy of high interest rates to curb inflation Peyser Answers for Democrats In a radio response made on behalf of the Democrats Representative Peter A Peyser of the Bronx and Westchester picked up the same theme He said it was unbelievable that President Reagan can brag about the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression The President asked us to celebrate the decline in inflation rate Mr Peyser went on Of course prices arent rising as fast as they were No one is buying anything The sad fact is that prices always slow down when you are entering a depression Look at what happened in the early 1930s In 1930 the inflation rate was zero The radio talks by the two men underscored a focus on the state of the economy in the fall election campaign Mr Reagan also lighted several candles at the White House today in honor of School Prayer Day an event sponsored by the advocates of officially sponsored prayer in schools Helms Measure Set Aside Mr Reagans political advisers have said they hoped to be able to use the issue of prayer in the schools against Democratic candidates But that plan was set back Thursday when the Senate set aside a measure sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina aimed at permitting school prayer The Helms measure like an antiabortion bill shelved the week before died before getting to the House of Representatives In private White House aides have criticized Mr Helmss strategy on the prayer issue Some have given him the blame for the Senate rejection Nonetheless at the White House ceremony President Reagan turned to Mr Helms and thanked him and his colleagues for all that they have done He also accused the Democratic leadership in the House of bottling up a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize officially sponsored school prayer When Congress recesses early in October White House aides have said the President will place less emphasis on abortion prayer crime and other social issues and turn his attention to the economy Low Rate of Price Increase In todays radio address Mr Reagan stressed economic matters He took his theme from the Friday announcement that consumer prices rose only threetenths of 1 percent in August which was taken as an indication that the inflation rate for all of 1982 could be at the lowest level in six years Presidential aides have expressed frustration over what they consider a lack of public appreciation of progress on inflation The New York TimesCBS News poll made public Wednesday for example reported that twothirds of those questioned felt that prices were rising as fast or faster as they were a year ago Mr Reagan opened his talk today by noting that memories fade quickly He spoke of the importance of inflation as a 1980 election issue saying it had reduced the purchasing power of Americans living on fixed incomes But he said In these less than two years inflation has been cut more than in half  down to 51 percent so far this year I know this isnt easy for people to see Mr Reagan went on But he said firmly for the first time in quite a while real aftertax income is increased and your paycheck buys more than it did As for unemployment Mr Reagan said the only way to renew economic growth would be to conquer inflation He also referred to a bill he supports that would provide training for 1 million Americans to find jobs in private business PublicWorks Jobs Sought Democratic leaders support the bill as Representative Peyser said although the Democrats assert that the measure by itself would not create new jobs Mr Peyser called on the President to support another Democraticsponsored bill involving spending of 1 billion to create 200000 temporary public works jobs The President had not referred to the latter bill He charged that the Democrats were trying to solve unemployment by spending too much Government money He said such an approach took us to the edge of economiuc Armageddon when the Democrats were in power and that Democrats are not qualified to lecture us now on the most fair effective way to end the crisis Theres only one major cause of our economic problems Government spending more than it takes in and sending you the bill Mr Reagan continued Theres only one permanent cure bringing Government spending in line with Government revenues He attacked liberals for advocating that Congress repeal the 10 percent personal income tax cut to take effect on July 1 1983 or an indexing provision that would keep tax rates level even if inflation increases Finally Mr Reagan called for a Constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget He charged that Democrats in the House were sitting on a historic measure already approved by the Senate and supported by 80 percent of the public
A CONSERVATIVE'S ABC'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/books/a-conservative-s-abc-s.html,PREJUDICES A Philosophical Dictionary By Robert Nisbet 318 pp Cambridge Mass Harvard University Press 1750 ROBERT NISBET the social philosopher borrows the form and subtitle of his latest book from Voltaire It consists of 70 short essays ordered alphabetically and treating a variety of social political and moral subjects from Abortion to Wit The title of the book however comes from Voltaires great conservative critic Edmund Burke By Prejudices Mr Nisbet means those deeply felt and sometimes illogical opinions that engage the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue thereby protecting it from the ravages of an overweening rationalism The union of Voltaire and Burke might seem to promise a certain ideological evenhandedness But in fact Burke is the overwhelmingly dominant partner in this marriage and the result is a profoundly often stridently conservative book The essays fall into three large categories Roughly a third of them examine social and political processes or institutions For Mr Nisbet a healthy society such as existed in Europe before the French Revolution  is characterized by strong communal and familial structures Life is regulated by the locality the guild the church and the clan all of which find expression in ritual and social custom In the last two centuries however this communal regime has been destroyed by the modern state and its intrusive bureaucracy Instead of community we now have a mass of undifferentiated individuals and the traditional authorities  the paterfamilias the priest the local dignitary  can no longer exercise the discipline that once assured a wellordered existence Until somehow the reality and sense of community have been restored to Western society in national local and kinship spheres Mr Nisbet warns people will continue to live in the void  egogratifying hedonistic narcissistic subjective and at the same time timorous trepidant fearful of death Here his lament echoes not so much Burke as the early 20thcentury school of French sociology particularly Emile Durkheim For Mr Nisbet as for Durkheim Anomie is the characteristic disorder of our era Occasionally this celebration of family and community leads to unexpected conclusions The most striking is provided by the essay on Abortion which Mr Nisbet defends as one of the traditional prerogatives of the family For the most part however his ideas are predictable Thus there are appreciative entries on Community Family Feudalism Ritual even Inquisitions and critical ones on Bureaucracy Individualism Judicial Activism Permissiveness and Social Revolution Communist countries are said to represent yet more extreme instances of the vicious social leveling typical of modern society as a whole and along with such political commentators as Irving Kristol and Jeane Kirkpatrick he urges us not to confuse merely authoritarian regimes like those of Argentina and Saudi Arabia which respect tradition with totalitarian ones like those of China and North Korea which dont Nothing seems to be more necessary to the future of freedom he writes than preservation of the sharp distinction between the authoritarian and the totalitarian states A second group of essays treats ideas and intellectual fashions all of which Mr Nisbet regards with the conservatives usual suspicion He is especially contemptuous of recent fads such as Environmentalism Futurology Psychohistory and Sociobiology But ideas in general he suggests lead only to trouble Indeed more often than not they lead to political revolution and with it the establishment of tyranny His argument here comes straight out of Burke who pinned the blame for the unhappy events of the French Revolution squarely on the intellectual pretensions of the 18thcentury philosophes Mr Nisbets favorite procedure  it amounts almost to a mannerism  is to assert that political ideas are in fact disguised religions since both offer the promise of a millennium This habit of argument might be called bullying by metaphor Thus Environmentalism is now well on its way to becoming the third great wave of redemptive struggle in Western history the first being Christianity the second modern socialism Marx is but a thin secular gloss on St Augustine while the French Marxist Louis Althusser is the Supreme Pontiff in the secession that began with Marx and Engels Mr Nisbets hostility to abstraction extends beyond the political realm to embrace any intellectual tradition that makes large claims or enjoys substantial influence One is hardly surprised that Rousseau Marx Lenin and Mao should take their licks But equal hostility is extended to Freud and Darwin both of whom are thrashed for their scientific lapses and intellectual hubris Even the great Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt gets taken to task for having propounded a lot of nonsense about the Renaissance The vigorous assertion of an idea whether it be Platos Chain of Being or Hegels Alienation elicits an almost instinctive reaction from Mr Nisbet as if any form of explicitness posed a threat to the essentially inarticulate rhythms of human existence He is happy only in the company of intellectuals like Alexis de Tocqueville who share his misgivings about abstraction although even the circumspect Tocqueville is found overextended in some of his pronouncements about the future of democracy Finally a third group of essays deals with what might be called the underlying psychological assumptions of Mr Nisbets conservatism  his conception of human nature Here again he is true to his intellectual forebears who beginning with Burke have stressed the ugliness and recalcitrance of the human passions Mr Nisbet draws a picture of imperialistic vices and retreating virtues Thus one finds entries on Boredom Covetousness Effrontery Envy Fanaticism Fatalism and Snobbism all of which are pronounced pandemic Intimacy would seem to sound a hopeful note but in fact we learn mainly about its tyrannical proclivities The final entries in the Dictionary are War and Wit characteristically Mr Nisbet discusses the psychological advantages of the former it relieves boredom and the practical liabilities of the latter people refuse to take you seriously Of pleasure generosity laughter or the love of beauty there is hardly a word In all of this one detects the characteristic myopia and special pleading of the conservative Barely mentioned for example are capitalism and the Industrial Revolution Only by virtually ignoring the economic realm can Mr Nisbet place all the blame for our woes on the utopian aspirations of political philosophers There are indeed structural similarities between Marx and St Augustine but they exist at a high level of abstraction Marx and other critics of capitalism are more readily explained in terms of their response to the economic realities of the modern world about which Mr Nisbet is studiously laconic At the same time he is inclined to romanticize the traditional communal order from which we have supposedly been uprooted A life dominated by locality guild and family is after all a life of provincialism dull routine and petty oppression Here it seems to me Freud offers a useful corrective since he more than anyone else drew our attention to the miseries attendant upon life within the family Along with the Greek tragedians he suggested that the state has no monopoly on horror stories Mr Nisbet might also ponder Madame Bovary or The Scarlet Letter for instruction on the rigors of life in the community While generally well written and occasionally persuasive Prejudices is a decidedly repetitious and unfunny book To be sure it often strives for humor but in a peculiarly leaden fashion There is unintended humor when the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities Emeritus at Columbia University bemoans the epidemic of titled chairs in academia But Mr Nisbets performance is unlikely to be confused with Voltaires which is not only humane lucid and unpredictable but above all funny
REAGAN TIPTOES AROUND SOME ECONOMIC LIABILITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/weekinreview/reagan-tiptoes-around-some-economic-liabilities.html,With the economys stresses threatening to cause an earthquake for Republicans in November just about every move President Reagan makes these days registers on a political seismograph at the White House That helps explain the Presidential positioning last week over a jobtraining bill school prayer abortion and an array of budget bills so intricate that only a handful of aficionados could follow them in detail Even the procedural question of whether Congress should have a lameduck session in November to deal with the 1983 budget was the focus of electionyear jockeying Meanwhile the Reagan Administrations consideration of many serious longterm budget problems has been put on hold until after Election Day At the Office of Management and Budget for example David A Stockman has halted the planned directors reviews of Federal agencies fiscal 1984 spending requests out of fear that leaks to the press might disclose cuts in sensitive areas What to do about the ailing Social Security system is the subject of a study by a special bipartisan panel winding up its work but not due to report until after Nov 2 In an environment where power normally flows to t ose who know whats going on senior White House aides maintain they are deliberately keeping themselves in the dark about budgetoffice studies of Pentagon spending cuts and possible tax increases Looming over all considerations is a figurative bomb that could blow up Oct 8 when the unemployment report for September is to be released White House aides are speculating nervously that after months of heading upward the figure could rise from Augusts 98 percent to 10 percent or more undermining Mr Reagans claim that the recession is bottoming out at last We have got to focus somehow on jobs jobs jobs said a Reagan strategist That is what the voters want to hear To this end a relatively minor Presidential action last week was instructive Mr Reagan rejecting the advice of budgetconscious aides endorsed a 3 billion jobtraining bill cleared by a HouseSenate conference committee after being stalled for a month The President called it an important initiative that would continue training more than a million Americans but transfer responsibility from Government to private business On Capitol Hill Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr immediately assailed Mr Reagan for endorsing a fine and needed bill but one that will not create a single new job Instead he called on the President to support a Democratic measure that would spend 1 billion to create 200000 public works jobs Symbolism Is All Neither side made any major claims for its bill  beyond the symbolism But symbolism is almost the only thing that a President or Speaker can bring to bear in a campaign that exists less on a national level than in hundreds of disparate election districts And symbolism may be an appropriate word for Mr Reagans lighting of a candle to send to demonstrators gathering at the Supreme Court yesterday to push for officially sanctioned prayer in schools But with the Republicancontrolled Senate shelving Senator Jesse Helmss school prayer bill last week  following its rejection of an antiabortion bill the week before White House aides acknowledged Mr Reagan would have more difficulty persuading voters to blame the Democrats for his socialissue setbacks Indeed several White House aides forecast that after Congress leaves town in a week there will be much less emphasis on social issues They agreed they said with recent opinion polls showing that the social issues had little impact on voters nationwide but argued that Mr Reagan still needed to emphasize them selectively His purpose is to galvanize support among religious fundamentalists in Southern and border states and Roman Catholics in urban areas especially the troops working in election campaigns who may have been questioning his solidarity As for the budget Reagan aides were pleased last week that the President had succeeded in getting Congressional leaders to march a bit more to the White Houses procedural rhythm At first Republican and Democratic leaders alike wanted Congress to pass a stopgap resolution to keep the Government operating until the spring six months after the fiscal year begins Oct 1 The Administration feared that would open the backdoor to increased spending Now Mr Reagan hopes to use the prospect of a postelection session to force Congress to keep specific appropriations bills to the ceilings agreed to in June before adjourning Of the several such measures that have been approved two the House passed last week are considered by the Administration to have exceeded those ceilings The bills for transportation and agriculture spending are candidates for a veto if they emerge unchanged But the competition with Congress is less harsh than it was last year when Mr Reagan insisted the lawmakers conform to his lower budget submitted in January This year the White House agreed in June to budget ceilings higher than it originally requested and Mr Reagan is asking only that Congress conform to them Because the budget process with its concurrent resolutions individual appropriations bills and stopgap resolutions has become so bewildering to the lay person Mr Reagan can only hope to create a condition in which he can draw lines clearly and accuse the Democrats of overspending But it is no secret at the White House that in the back of everybodys mind there is another possible item for the agenda of a lameduck session Social Security an issue so hazardous that an aide to Speaker ONeill refers to it as the third rail of American politics Anyone who touches it gets electrocuted politically For that reason a postelection session might be the best time to take on cutting Social Security benefits or raising Social Security taxes Few in Congress think such hopes are realistic But the budget choices facing the Administration next year are so severe that White House aides are known to be entertaining the private hope that Social Security changes could be disposed of in an unheated way before Jan 1 which could open Mr Reagans most difficult year with Congress
THE NATION IN SUMMARY; Sad Precedent; for G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/weekinreview/the-nation-in-summary-sad-precedent-for-gop.html,According to form the party in control of the White House loses Congressional seats in midterm elections and in bad economic times the loss can be severe Last week a New York TimesCBS News Poll suggested how bad things could be Fiftyfour percent leaned toward Democrats and only 38 percent backed Republicans That translates roughly to a Democratic gain of roughly 40 seats many of the Administrations key Congressional victories have been won by half that Most significantly Democrats were strong in their own districts ahead 6032  and Republicans were shaky in theirs behind 4743 suggesting that normally Democratic voters who defected in 1980  possibly because of that years recession  could be returning to the fold As for this years recession 72 percent felt that the economy or an aspect of it is the nations most important problem Other issues such as the proposed nuclear freeze school prayer and banning abortion didnt matter much The findings left one Republican undismayed and one Democrat unconsoled Representative Guy Vander Jagt chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee thought Republicans would use the advantages of incumbency and money to overcome the disadvantage He predicted that Republicans would actually gain because the poll now showed them with a 4745 percent advantage in the 59 open seats to be filled The chagrined Democrat was Representative Billy Lee Evans of Georgia who lost in a runoff last week to another Democrat Roy Rowland thus becoming only the fourth incumbent to lose to a nonincumbent in a House primary all year
DEMOCRATS SEE UPHILL STATE SENATE BATTLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/nyregion/democrats-see-uphill-state-senate-battle.html,WHITE PLAINS BECAUSE success can be a hard thing to argue with the three Democratic candidates in the 35th 36th and 37th State Senate Districts concede they may be in for a tough campaign They are trying to unseat three of the countys most influential Republican Senators The races involve Senator Joseph R Pisani of New Ro chelle and Susan Oppenheim er Mayor of the village of Mamaroneck in the 36th Dis trict Senator John E Flynn of Yonkers and Patrick D Pilla Mayor of Tarrytown in the 35th District and Senator Mary B Goodhue of Mount Kisco and Michael Timm a lawyer from Cold Spring NY in the 37th District The challengers openly acknowledge that their biggest task will be to overcome the immense popularity of their opponents Its going to be an uphill battle Mrs Oppenheimer concluded Im fighting an institution Mr Timm said referring to Mrs Goodhue Even you know him as Chippy Mr Pilla said with a forlorn smile when a reporter referred to Mr Flynn by his commonly known nickname The incumbents may hope that popularity will translate into votes at the polls this November but they are also banking on their records of service to the community to return them to office In interviews last week the challengers said they planned tocounter by attacking those records and by pointing out inconsistencies in the incumbents voting records Mrs Oppenheimer Mr Pilla and Mr Timm noted for example that all three Senators have voted with their party 99 percent of the time on key issues I can assure you that I will never vote with my party 99 percent of the time Mrs Oppenheimer said My party is not going to be right on all the issues 99 percent of the time Mr Timm questioned how independant Mrs Goodhue was if she consistently voted with her colleagues In her campaign literature she uses the reference we in speaking of how she and her Republican colleagues in the Senate have resisted voting for bills that may be popular but are aimed at a specific interest group he observed last week in his White Plains law office Mr Pilla faces an opponent who holds the distinction of having more bills signed into law than has any other legislator in either house But he charged that despite Mr Flynns impressive record in many ways the Senator has not been effective even though his party was in the majority The three incumbents dismissed suggestions that their votes were strictly partisan Mr Pisani said he disregards political considerations in delivering what is needed in the district a position that was echoed by his Republican colleagues I vote the way I feel Mrs Goodhue said Id like to think that my constituents and I agree Senator Flynn who is seeking his eighth term responded by citing a list of bills he has sponsored and who they have benefited Is it partisan that I brought to the city of Yonkers an increase of 53 percent in overall state aid he asked rhetorically I got an 87000 appropriation for the Jewish community in my district I obtained a 50000 appropriation for the Latin American center for youths in Yonkers Ive carried most of the legislation on the elderly and the handicapped All anyone has to do is look at my record and they know what I stand for The Republicans described themselves as conservative on fiscal matters but added that they consider themselves moderate on other issues Each voted to maintain the states use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortion although all three said that they were morally opposed to abortion Each also supported raising the drinking age to 19 and increasing state aid to school districts The Democrats who described themselves as liberals differed with the incumbents on the death penalty which they all oppose and the Republicans all support and on abortion where the Democrats declare themselves prochoice But they tended to agree in other areas All six candidates for example favor increasing to 51 percent from 35 percent the number of tenants in favor before an apartment building can be converted to a cooperative or condominium They all call for tougher sentencing for violent criminal offenders And each bitterly criticized the use of the property tax to finance school districts So far the campaigns have not been particularly issueoriented and have centered mainly on appearances at shopping malls railraod stations and social events The first debates are scheduled for this week Mrs Oppenheimer and Mr Pisani on WVOX radio at 10 AM Thursday Mrs Goodhue and Mr Timm on WLNA radio at 945 Saturday On Oct 28 Mr Flynn and Mr Pilla are scheduled to debate in Mount Pleasant For the next six weeks the candidates plan to blitz as many county sites as possible In the literature they pass out with every handshake a concise biographical and political synopsis is offered to voters  Mr Pisani who is 53 years old has served 16 years in the Legislature seven of those in the Assembly He is seeking his fifth term in the Senate where he serves as chairman of the Labor Committee A graduate of Iona College and of the Fordham University Law School he has a private law practice in White Plains Mr Pisani who recently became a grandparent lives with his wife Joan in New Rochelle  Mrs Oppenheimer 47 threeterm Mayor of Mamaroneck likes to

CONSULTANTS' CURRENCY: INFORMATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/27/us/consultants-currency-information.html,Ray Strother thinks Democrats will run particularly well this year among working women so when he tries to reach this voting group he buys time for his candidates on the evening news program I used to buy soap operas and game shows but thats not true anymore said Mr Strother who is advising candidates in a halfdozen states this fall Women are working theyre more independent theyre concerned about losing their jobs Mr Strother is a political consultant one of several dozen such professionals who make their home base in Washington but who seem to spend a lot of time in the Chicago and Atlanta airports changing planes They earn a significant chunk of the millions of dollars spent on political campaigns every other year and then plow a good share of that back into the capitals economy Printers film makers direct mail specialists advertising agencies writers  they all pocket some of the money spent by candidates who are running in districts thousands of miles away from Washington The main currency of the consultants trade is information They pick it up any way they can opinion surveys chats with friends news clippings even plain old gossip That information is turned into advice into strategic decisions that can win or lose close campaigns and alter the direction of Government policy An Insight Into Trends Almost all consultants work for only one party and within that partisan circle information and advice are quickly shared with colleagues who might be facing similar problems If Ray Strother finds that his advertisements on the evening news are winning female voters for Senator Dennis DeConcini in Arizona Jill Buckley will probably use the same approach in Senator Quentin Burdicks race in North Dakota The political intelligence that circulates among these consultants provides an insight into the themes and trends that are starting to bubble up in campaigns around the country One of the most striking is that women seem consistently more favorable toward Democrats than do men and the main reason is the threatening level of unemployment Many women are working now said Mr Strother and theyre the first ones who are going to get fired in todays economy Consultants in both parties agree that the economic situation dominates this years election Miss Buckley who works only for Democrats jokes that she was working at an editing studio recently In the next booth was Doug Bailey a Republican consultant Both were finishing commercials focused on the jobs issue There must be thousands of spots this year with pictures of empty factories said Miss Buckley who works with a partner Joe Rothstein Footage of Computers But she also says Democrats will suffer at the polls if they do not offer alternatives to the Reagan program so many of her candidates are stressing the need to create hightechnology jobs in aging industrial areas I cant tell you how much footage we have of computers Miss Buckley said Representative Thomas A Daschle a BuckleyRothstein candidate in South Dakota is running advertisements that stress his effort to rescue farms from bankruptcy In Connecticut Representative Toby Moffett the Democratic candidate for the Senate is propounding legislation that would limit imports of foreign goods that compete for American markets The Republican consultants generally agree that if they have to talk about the economy their best line is to plead for patience to tell voters that things cant improve overnight Right now they think most of their candidates can ride out the economic slump but they live with what might be called the 10 percent nightmare the fear that the unemployment rate might reach double digits next month At 98 percent I dont the unemployment rate will be much of an issue this year said Eddie Mahe a former Republican Party official who notes that many jobless workers do not bother to vote But the psychological element of 10 percent might change that Playing Up an Airport The Republicans generally agree that their candidates are better off if they can shift the focus away from the economy In South Carolina for instance Charlie Black has told Representative John L Napier a freshman Republican to talk about the money he has brought into the district for a refurbished airport Napier defends the Reagan program when asked but he doesnt emphasize it said Mr Black who noted that his candidate represents a heavily Democratic district In Florida and Ohio Mr Black has Republican candidates for governor talking about crime which the consultant sees as a sleeper issue this year In Tennessee Mr Mahe is managing Representative Robin L Beard the Republican candidate for the Senate The Democratic incumbent Senator Jim Sasser recently voted to kill antiabortion legislation and the Republican is making the most of it The more voters are focused on right to life and less on the economy the better off I am Mr Mahe said Advisers in both camps are saying that members of minority groups might vote in higher numbers this year Mr Strother for instance is buying a lot of time for his candidates in Texas and Arizona on Spanishlanguage radio stations The Most to Lose Minorities usually vote in low numbers but Mr Strother thinks they might turn out this year because they are frightened of Mr Reagan and his economic policies They feel they have the most to lose he said David Keene a Republican agrees that the minority vote could be important The question is whether theyll be teed off enough to vote The elderly are another focus of considerable attention Patrick H Caddell advised Senator George J Mitchell Democrat of Maine to stress the Social Security issue and the consultant reports that the Senator has shot up in the polls as a result Mr Keene says that Republicans have to reply by stressing the decline in inflation But for all their special insight and inside information the political consultants cannot beat the odds Every time one of them wins another one loses
"FOR REPUBLICANS: ONE ELECTION, TWO CAMPAIGNS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/28/us/for-republicans-one-election-two-campaigns.html,Between Congress and the White House there are two sometimes conflicting Republican campaigns this year and only one of them is sure of its themes It is not as might be expected the 425 Republicans running for the House and Senate who are having difficulty with their issues They are remarkably united on a basic campaign pitch that argues that economic progress will take time considering the mess the Democrats left but that it is important to be patient and stay the course To the Congressional leaders the recession compels this emphasis and Representative Guy Vander Jagt chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee says his colleagues hear criticism from voters whenever the focus shifts to matters such as abortion or school prayer Voters he said ask Republicans who who stray into soscial issues Why are you swatting at flies when the house is burning down But at the White House the political messages and themes tumble up against each other leaving an indistinct message that stresses economic arguments one day and abortion and prayer the next Sometimes the emphasis shifts even more quickly in a single speech as when President Reagan turned Friday from the basic economic argument to the insistence that he was not abandoning the social issues that have to do with the morals of this country and the great standards that made this country great Dispute Over the Huckster He did so after some of his aides had told reporters that those messages were going to be deemphasized and used very selectively both because they distracted from the economic argument and because they did not have a national appeal that would win votes Others were even more categorical saying these subjects would be dropped entirely The whole question of whether to stress the economy or social issues is more than one of political tactics though the fear that we still dont have a game plan for these elections as one knowledgeable White House aide put it is a serious one That disarray spreads beyond issues to the use of the Presidents time One afternoon last week a high level aide said that Mr Reagan would not be a huckster campaigning for every Republican who wanted him Later that day a staff colleague reported with disgust what he called the totally ludicrous argument that Lets not use him as a huckster  But also at issue are some thoughtful theoretical differences about the path for growth of the Republican Party Some White House aides like many of the Presidents hardcore conservative critics contend that Mr Reagans opposition to abortion and support of school prayer won him votes in 1980 not only from Southern fundamentalists but from Northern bluecollar voters They see those concerns as the road to the partys growth More Time for Theory Congressional Republicans disagree saying that it was the economic failures of the Carter Administration that mattered especially in the North Early in 1981 when identification with the Republican Party was soaring and talk of political realignment was at its height polls for The New York TimesCBS News suggested very strongly that it was the hope of economic progress that was bringing converts many of whom had little use for Mr Reagans views on social issues There is more time for theory at the White House of course and a concern that runs beyond the 1982 elections and how Mr Reagan will look in 1984 or in the light of history And Mr Reagans aides acknowledge that he raised these matters as strongly as he did because he was sensitive to criticisms from some conservatives that he had forgotten his conservative roots Neither of those concerns meanmuch to Republicans on the ballot this fall Some of them fume that the President is kowtowing to Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and the leader of the antiabortion proprayer effort in the Senate They express no doubt whatever on Mr Reagans firm convictions but they question his priorities arguing that it will be harder to accomplish anything he wants if he lets Republican lawmakers take a licking in November Senator Bob Packwood chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and an abortion rights advocate says that most of the candidates would just as soon not have these issues raised because they think they have more votes to lose from people who disagree with them than to be won from those who agree Issues Dont Mean Votes The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll suggests that those issues generally do not translate into votes at all The antiabortion amendment Mr Reagan favors is opposed by twothirds of the public and even among its supporters issues relating to the economy are the ones that seem to be influencing voter intentions An amendment to allow organized prayer in public schools while favored by twothirds of the public has no impact on voting intentions Even among the twofifths of registered voters who say it makes a great deal of difference 57 percent of the prayer supporters but also 57 percent of the prayer opponents say they intend to vote Democratic The poll supports Mr Vander Jagts judgment that our gaining or losing hinges really on the economic issues and all the other issues are really peripheral There are other sets of tensions between Congressional and White House Republicans Some White House aides regard as silly Mr Vander Jagts predictions of gains in House seats and Mr Packwoods contention that all Republican seats even the vacant one in California are secure against the Democrats They think such assertions make it seem that Republicans are not in the real political world The same charge comes back the other way But some Congressional Republicans think the lack of focus on the economy goes beyond Mr Reagans own honest concerns with prayer and abortion They observe that despite Mr Reagans Friday tribute to a bill to provide job training by private industry internal White House arguments over the cost of the bill led to recommendations of a veto threat by both David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget and Edwin Meese 3d counselor to the President Shaking his head over the idea of vetoing any kind of jobs bill with unemployment at 98 percent and an election less than six weeks away one Republican strategist said Sometimes I think they arent in touch with the same reality I deal with
SENATE APPROVES BILL TO RUN GOVERNMENT BEYOND TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/30/us/senate-approves-bill-to-run-government-beyond-today.html,The Clinch River breeder reactor barely survived a Senate vote today as senators began floor debate on a catchall interim spending bill needed to keep the Government operating in the fiscal year that begins Friday A total of 53 amendments were proposed by senators who sought to use the catchall measure as an instrument to change national policy or to increase or decrease funds for various projects Senate Republican leaders who said they feared consideration of all the amendments would delay action on the bill beyond Fridays deadline persuaded their colleagues to withdraw some of them By late afternoon however 40 amendments remained on the docket The Senate rejected 50 to 46 an effort led by Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina to delete funds for the MX missile after Senator John Tower Republican of Texas warned If this amendment is adopted theyll be dancing in the streets of Moscow Other major amendments included Democratic efforts to provide funds for public service jobs and extended unemployment benefits and an unsuccessful move by conservative Republicans to bar the use of union dues for political purposes unless specifically authorized by the donor Frustration Among Membership The number of amendments tells me that theres general frustration among the membership said Senator Ted Stevens Republican of Alaska the majority whip He added that most of these amendments are bills that are on the calendar but we havent had a chance to call them up because the session has focused on fiscal legislation and social issues including abortions and officially sanctioned school prayer Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas said A lot of people see it as their last best shot and feel that if they dont go after these things now they may not get another shot The omnibus bill is needed to finance Government spending in the fiscal year 1983 because none of 13 individual appropriations bills has been enacted into law The appropriations bills augment authorization bills which set national policy and conform to the budget resolution which sets spending ceilings revenue floors and spending priorities Once the Senate adopts an interim spending bill a HouseSenate conference can be expected to convene promptly to resolve differences between the House and Senate measures The major difference regards military spending The House bill passed last week would keep military spending at the current level 205 billion while the Senate bill would give the Pentagon 2334 billion Edwin L Dale Jr a press spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said that unless the measure was enacted by midnight Thursday there would be serious disruptions of Government service In the past however such threats have been regarded as efforts to prod Congress into action and disruptions did not occur until several days after the expiration of funds Special Session in November At President Reagans behest Congress will reconvene Nov 29 in a special session to work on the individual appropriations bill The Senate version of the interim bill would expire Dec 22 while the Housepassed version would expire Dec 15 Although both Senate and House leaders dislike making policy decisions through appropriations bills the practice has become increasingly common in part because fiscal bills have dominated the session Thus although the interim measure would be in effect nearly three months it could set a precedent that could mean the life or death of disputed projects Such an effort was made today by opponents of the Clinch River breeder reactor who failed to halt funds for the project by a 49to48 vote A total of 17 Republicans joined 31 Democrats in opposing the project a nuclear reactor designed to produce more plutonium fuel than it consumes Voting on Party Lines Senators from New York New Jersey and Connecticut voted along party lines Republican Senators Alfonse M DAmato of New York Nicholas Brady of New Jersey and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut supported the reactor which was opposed by Democratic Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Christopher J Dodd of Connecticut The projects major supporter Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee the Senate majority leader told the Senate that although the reactor was located in his home state It certainly wasnt conceived as a Tennessee project He added Its a national project of major importance The major opponents were Senators Bumpers and Gordon J Humphrey Republican of New Hampshire who charged that since businessmen arent willing to invest their money why should the Congress be willing to invest the taxpayers money Senator Bumpers noted that the Government Accounting Office now estimates that the cost of the project has increased from 500 million its initial estimate to 87 billion This reactor cannot possibly be commercialized or cost effective before the year 2020 he said A Technological Turkey Youll spend 9 billion and youll have a technological turkey on your hands the senator added After the vote Mr Bumpers attributed the defeat to the power of Senator Baker You cant underestimate the power of the leadership he said Under both the House and Senate bills the reactor would continue to be financed at 199 million annually the same level as in the fiscal year 1982 Meanwhile the Senate Appropriations Committee reversing its previous action deleted from the spending bill a provision that the Federal Trade Commission could not regulate professions that were regulated by state law The measure was supported by the American Medical Association Supporters of this provision said they had agreed to its deletion in an effort to eliminate controversy from the interim spending measure and they vowed to seek to restore the provision when the individual appropriations bill is considered in November The Senate tabled 62 to 37 a proposal by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina that would prohibit union dues or fees from being used for political purposes without the express consent of the individual union member

CONFEREES ADOPT STOPGAP FUND BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/01/us/conferees-adopt-stopgap-fund-bill.html,Congress missed the deadline tonight for action on a catchall spending bill needed to finance the Government in the next two and a half months even though House and Senate conferees adopted a compromise measure resolving differences in the legislation approved by each chamber The House and Senate will not act on the measure until Friday Congressional leaders barred a latenight session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats President Reagan invited all members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House while Democrats were having a 1000aplate fundraising dinner The major disagreement was on the level of military spending The Housepassed bill would have continued spending at the level of the 1982 fiscal year 205 billion while the Senatepassed bill would have spent at the proposed level for 1983 2334 billion The conferees reached a compromise 2287 billion but with the stipulation that no new programs be financed This would eliminate funds for the MX missile B1 bomber and supercarriers among other projects Everybody Goes to Work The Office of Management and Budget indicated that no harm would be done if the bill was enacted Friday Everybody goes to work tomorrow said Edwin L Dale Jr spokesman for the agency All nonessential workers may have to go into a shutdown mode canceling all meetings and not doing their ordinary business but we do not anticipate any furloughs The new fiscal year begins at 1201 AM Friday and the Government will be technically without funds because none of the 13 separate appropriation bills have been enacted The stopgap measure is needed to provide funds to keep the Government operating The HouseSenate conferees agreed on Dec 17 as the expiration date of the stopgap bill The House bill would have expired on Dec 15 and the Senate bill Dec 22 At the outset House conferees complained that the Senate bill contained 100 changes in existing law including 31 changes in dollar figures adding 332 billion 54 language changes and 15 technical changes Veto Danger Is Cited If we send this down to the White House wed be inviting a veto said Representative Jamie L Whitten Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee It attacks the whole idea of being a continuing resolution The omnibus spending bill is called a continuing resolution because it is intended to continue financing of Government agencies Initially continuing resolutions merely continued financing at the previous years level but in recent years they have made changes in financing and in policy such as prohibitions against the use of Federal funds for abortions Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee said that the White House is looking for a way to sign this rather than pick another fight with Congress by vetoing the measure and delaying members return to their districts to campaign for reelection I admit we probably have added a lot of garbage in it the Senator added Congress is scheduled to adjourn Friday to enable members to campaign It will reconvene Nov 29 at the Presidents behest to work on the 13 separate appropriation bills In a related matter the House today authorized 66 billion for health research programs through the 1985 fiscal year The measure was passed by voice vote and was sent to the Senate Experiments on Fetuses Curbed Such authorizations set national policy which is augmented through appropriation bills that conform to the budget resolution which sets spending ceilings revenue floors and spending priorities In a key vote the House adopted 260 to 240 an amendment that would prohibit the use of Federal funds for experiments on fetuses and the newly born unless needed to insure an infants survival The proposal was sponsored by Representative William E Danneyemer Republican of California We dont want any Dr Mengeles from Auschwitz in our society experimenting on living human beings with a Godgiven immortal soul said Representative Robert K Dornan Republican of California Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California and chairman of the health subcommittee of the Commerce Committee countered What youre talking about keeping the researchers from doing is prevented by present law
IN THE NATION; CHALLENGE IN VIRGINIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/01/opinion/in-the-nation-challenge-in-virginia.html,No wonder Ronald Reagan came to Virginia to campaign for Representative Paul Trible the Republican senatorial candidate Mr Trible now appears in danger of losing a seat the Presidents party had counted on adding to its slim Senate majority That seat has been held since 1933 by the Harry Byrds senior and junior Little Harry who caucuses with the Democrats and generally votes with the Republicans is retiring from the Senate this year at age 67 after resisting all GOP urgings to switch parties With no Democratic incumbent running Mr Trible  a 35yearold Reagan clone who is a threeterm member of the House from this Tidewater area  looked like a sure thing in a conservative state But last Sunday a poll published in The Richmond TimesDispatch gave him a lead no bigger than the polls margin of error over Lieut Gov Richard J Davis the Democratic nominee Yet Mr Trible has been running for the Senate more or less openly for over a year while Mr Davis was nominated last June only after Gov Charles Robb and Democratic leaders had backed two other candidates both of whom withdrew Mr Davis also is against the death penalty on moral grounds though Virginians support it heavily and has bucked such conservative goals as a national righttowork law he supports the Virginia version Mr Trible moreover is the very model of a wellheeled Republican his coffers packed with local money as well as hefty contributions from national Republican funds Mr Davis has so far raised 600000 perhaps half Mr Tribles total In Richmond about 50000 flowed into the Trible treasury at a 500perticket reception for the President At almost the same time Dick Davis was picking up only about 13000 at a 100aplate luncheon in Portsmouth where he used to be Mayor But Mr Daviss audience was composed almost entirely of women he told them that he would have voted for the Equal Rights Amendment if he had had the chance to break a tie as presiding officer of the Virginia Senate Mr Trible is on record against the ERA That may be one reason the Republican candidate is not doing so well since women are politically active here as elsewhere and another TimesDispatch poll shows that a plurality of Virginians would support a new ERA But there are other reasons The Davis campaign has effectively charged Mr Trible with a poor attendance record in Congress here in Tidewater where defense establishments are economically vital radio spots constantly accuse him of missing important Pentagon appropriations votes Mr Trible stumbled too when his staff circulated a memo that charged Davis representatives with soliciting funds and showing TV spots at a New York meeting of labors Committee On Political Education Thats hardball in Virginia politics but Mr Davis terming the memo a malicious falsehood responded that no such meeting had occurred and that he had no TV spots Mr Trible has never adequately explained the memo his inability to do so shook the confidence of some of his backers and the controversy cost him valuable momentum for more than three weeks while the Davis campaign was getting off the ground Mr Davis is an affable banker with a moderate reputation a decorated Marine veteran of both World War II and the Korean War not a small asset amid the shades of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson He has excellent name recognition from last years race for lieutenant governor  in which he received a larger percentage of the vote than Governor Robb did in the gubernatorial election Mr Davis also has turned Mr Tribles financial advantage into something of a liability by charging Mr Trible with trying to buy the election and by assuring fiscally conservative Virginians of his own ability to campaign on half as much money Despite Mr Tribles ritual attempts to link him to Edward Kennedy he assures Virginians hell be as independent as Harry Byrd Virginia may not be quite as conservative as advertised anyway that TimesDispatch poll found a majority favoring licensing of pistols a plurality supporting a nuclear arms freeze and a plurality opposing private school tuition credits and a constitutional amendment to ban abortion But voters favored the death penalty by 66 to 22 percent Dick Davis himself believes the best thing he has going for him is the Reagan economic program the principal issue in Virginia He says hes walking a tightrope by criticizing it since the Presidents personal popularity is still relatively high To reduce impending budget deficits he favors deferring or reducing the thirdyear tax cut and  even in defenseminded Virginia  demands close scrutiny of military spending Thus the election is likely to be seen as a referendum on Reaganomics another good reason why Mr Reagan put himself on the line for Paul Trible
REAGAN ENTERTAINS JUSTICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/02/us/reagan-entertains-justices.html,President Reagan acted as host today at an elegant luncheon for the Supreme Court Justices and politely told his guests that he and other Americans do not always agree with their rulings As a string quartet played in the background Mr Reagan and the nine justices sat at a long table in the State Dining Room eating cold Maine lobster lamb in herb sauce saffron rice artichokes Florentine pear sorbet and petit fours Mr Reagan told the justices that most Americans respect and abide by the decisions of the judiciary as a matter of course Now this isnt to say of course that well always agree on the important issues that are presented to you for decision he added But we frequently take a little comfort in the fact that the Court itself is frequently of more than one mind about such matters And its neither surprising nor disturbing that our citizens may at times side with the dissenters Its even rumored that Presidents sometimes disagree with particular Supreme Court decisions Devate Held Inevitable Its inevitable that the Courts decisions become the focus of popular attention and debate and certainly our founding fathers expected nothing different Mr Reagan himself has criticized Court decisions legalizing abortion and prohibiting officially sanctioned prayer in public schools And he is now pushing for constitutional amendments to override the Courts rulings on those two points Mr Reagan told the Justices About one point at least there can be no disagreement whatsoever the Supreme Court must continue to demonstrate the independence and integrity that have always been its hallmarks You as members of the Court are the principal guardians of those traditions under the rights and freedoms of all Americans The luncheon marked the revival of an annual meeting between the President and the Court Mr Reagan said that the practice dated back to the days when the justices came to the White House to advise the president that they had survived the rigors of stagecoaches and horseback and so forth
"HOUSE, BY 46 VOTES, REJECTS PROPOSAL ON A BUDGET LIMIT",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/02/us/house-by-46-votes-rejects-proposal-on-a-budget-limit.html,The House of Representatives today decisively defeated a proposed constitutional amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget The vote was 236 to 187 in favor of the proposal but that fell 46 votes short of the twothirds necessary to approve an amendment for consideration by the states Transcript of news session page 13 Within minutes of the vote President Reagan expressed his reaction of deep burning anger and urged voters to register their own reaction in the Nov 2 Congressional elections against what he termed the Democratic leaderships stonewalling and budgetbusting The vote came one day after the President traveled to Capitol Hill to campaign for the amendment and continued the Administrations recent losing streak in Congress Since the summer the lawmakers have overridden Mr Reagans veto of a 14 billion spending bill and defeated proposals he favored that would have made it more difficult for a woman to obtain an abortion and would have allowed officially sanctioned prayer in public schools Presidential Power Slipping In todays vote 167 Republicans and 69 Democrats voted for the amendment while 167 Democrats and 20 Republicans voted against it To many Congressional analysts the vote today and the earlier ones indicate that Mr Reagans power over Congress so dominant in the first 18 months of his Presidency has been significantly weakened If the Democrats increase their seats in next months elections he could face a tougher time on Capitol Hill in the second half of his Presidency The House voted as Congress prepared to head home for the election recess With that election barely a month Both houses of congress approved a compromise spending bill that provides the Government with funds until Dec 17 Page 12 away both sides were keenly aware of the amendments political volatility Recent days have been filled with some of the sharpest legislative jockeying of the Congressional session In particular the White House has repeatedly threatened to use todays vote as a campaign issue against its opponenets an as soon as the votes were tallied the President went on the Political offensive Voters across America should count heads and take names he said after entering the White House briefing room and reading a prepared denunication of the Democrats for the television cameras In November we must elect representatives who support the amendment when we propose it again in the spring Asked whether the complicated legislative maneuvering meant that House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr had finally beaten him on this issue after losing a number of legislative battles with Mr Reagan earlier the President turned as he left the podium paused and said No he beat the American people One Democrat maintained that it was Mr Reagan who had played politics with the constitutional amendement Its all a charade said Representative Les Aspin Democrat of Wisconsin They dont want the substance they want the issue They want to be able to beat up on folks who voted against it This is the most political White House I have ever dealt with said Representative Richard Bolling a Missouri Democrat who is chairman of the House Rules Committee It reminds me of a combination of Johnson and Nixon and if that doesnt frighten people weve got a problem A Hidden Ball Trick Democrats acknowledge that some of them could suffer from the vote but they insist that the Administrations economic record will continue to be the focus of campaigning The amendment was a kind of hidden ball trick said Representative Jim Wright of Texas the House majority leader But the public will keep its eye on the ball on the central issues  unemployment raging recession and a record number of business failures The constitutional amendment which was approved by the Republicancontrolled Senate in August would require Congress to adopt a balanced budget every year except during wartime The mandate could be waived only by a threefifths vote of both chambers A threefifths vote would also be required to increase taxes at a faster rate than the rise in national income After the Senate approved the amendment House Democrats tried to keep the amendment bottled up in the House Judiciary Committee But the sponsors forced it to the floor earlier this week by gathering 218 signatures on a discharge petition Democratic leaders then decided to call for a vote immediately thus undercutting the Presidents argument that they were obstructing his program Moreover the Democrats wanted the balanced budget issue behind them by next week when the September unemployment rate is announced many here expect it to exceed 10 percent Surprised by Victory Margin Going into todays debate Democratic leaders thought the vote would be very close and were surprised by their margin of victory The explanation they said is that when the House members finally examined the details fo the amendment and its implications their doubts grew Members focused on the very serious consequences of tampering with the Constitution Mr Wright said They realized it was not a thing to treat lightly for temporary political gain Earlier in the day the Democrats presented their own alternative which was mainly a way to give some of their members a chance to vote for at least one balanced budget proposal As the Democrats expected the alternative was defeated 346 to 77 In the course of the long debate backers of the amendment argued that it was the only way of imposing fiscal discipline on a Congress that has adopted deficit budgets for 21 of the last 22 years Congress is like a drunken sailor who desperately needs Alcoholics Anonymous maintained Representative Dan Coats Republican of Indiana Congress needs a constitutional amendment to cure its addiction to deficit spending Representative Barber B Conable Jr the upstate New York Republican who cosponsored the amendment cited public opinion polls showing wide support for a balanced budget and said The people expect it He also warned that 31 states had already called for constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget amendment only three short of the 34 needed Any amendment drafted by that convention Mr Conable added would be a straitjacket crafted by people who dont have to live with the results In reply opponents stressed that the amendment was an unguided missile as Representative Henry S Reuss Democrat of Wisconsin described it  a fundamental change in Congressional procedures that could damage the Governments ability to stimulate the economy in times of sluggish economic growth Says Answer Lies in Courage Representative Leon E Panetta a California Democrat compared the amendments sponsors to a lynch mob who were looking for a culprit to take the blame for the failing economy and added To deal with these problems takes courage in daytoday votes Thats where the answer lies Representative David R Obey Democrat of Wisconsin said amendments should not be enacted casually and urged his colleagues to defend the Constitution against election year gimmickry

NOW SUPPORTING SOME MEN INSTEAD OF WOMEN FOR OFFICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/us/now-supporting-some-men-instead-of-women-for-office.html,The National Organization for Women has chosen this year to support many male Democratic candidates instead of their female opponents in an attempt to reduce the strength of the Republican Party in Congress The decision is drawing criticism from many women running on the Republican ticket who have been refused money from NOWs political action committee including Representative Millicent Fenwick candidate for the Senate from New Jersey and two House contenders Marie Muhler of New Jersey and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut Some of the women say that their views are in keeping with those supported by NOW and that to deny them funds is contrary to the organizations stated purposes In response Eleanor Smeal president of NOW says We dont like the Republican Senate and obviously we would not like to have the same situation in the House That does not mean we dont support Republicans but what it does mean is we have to take a second look They have to be pretty outstanding under these circumstances women as well as men Plans to Donate 2 Million Diane Bonk a NOW spokesman said the organizations political committee planned to donate at least 2 million to candidates this year Mrs Johnson strongly protested the groups decision to support her opponent William Curry She telephoned a local television program on which two representatives of the Connecticut chapter of NOW appeared Thursday and debated with them for several minutes I have an excellent record better than my opponents Mrs Johnson said later citing her support as a State Assemblywoman for such issues as child care abortion rights shelters for battered women and the proposed Federal equal right admendment They were not concerned about my record she said They were only concerned about a partisan fight to keep Republicans out of office John Fuchs Mrs Fenwicks campaign manager speaking of the New Jersey NOW chapters decision last week to support her Democratic opponent Frank Lautenberg said The whole things rather puzzling a womens group supporting a man particularly when the woman supports almost everything they stand for He noted Mrs Fenwicks 10year record of support for the equal rights admendment and her longtime backing of daycare programs as examples of her commitment to feminist issues Representatives of NOW say that a candidates stand on womens issues or the fact that a candidate is a woman are only two of many factors used to decide who gets funds Other issues are the candidates stand on Social Security civil rights of homosexuals Federal financing for education and the maintenance of various social programs Decisions on political contributions are made first on the local and state level then voted on by the national board NOW officials said Obviously if all things are the same we would rather see more women in office Mrs Smeal said but we also think its important that the person endorse our views For us a Democratic Congress a Democratic leadership is better
ADVICE FOR SURVIVAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/books/advice-for-survival.html,THE REAL ANTISEMITISM IN AMERICA By Nathan Perlmutter and Ruth Ann Perlmutter 303 pp New York Arbor House 1550 ANTISEMITISM is a subject that makes smart people stupid It comes from such disparate sources the right and the left embraces such contradictory ideas the Jew as subversive the Jew as exploiter shows itself in so many guises and hides itself in so many pious rationalizations that it confounds our usual political categories As a result no other social issue has inspired less reasonable nuanced argument or more blatant oversimplification evasion and denial If gentiles tend to resist recognizing any form of antiSemitism more subtle than neoNazi ranting that is any form of which they themselves might be accused Jews too often allow their political loyalties and preconceptions to determine which brands of antiSemitism they will attack and which they will tolerate or explain away Such double standards insure that our understanding of antiSemitism remains fragmented and shallow our opposition to it spasmodic and ineffective The Real AntiSemitism in America purports to warn Jews against falling into this trap it is aimed primarily at liberal Jews who the authors contend are dangerously tolerant of leftwing antiSemitism The Perlmutters present themselves as impartial critics of both the right and the left concerned only with guiding American Jews through the complexities of a world where they may dodge a mob only to step on a mine The book is not a tightly constructed argument but a folksy rather disorganized melange of polemic personal reminiscence instructive anecdotes and statistics Its center does not quite hold an impression reinforced by a disconcerting shift of perspective Though it has a double authorship and its foreword speaks of our views the rest of the book is a firstperson narrative whose I is Nathan Perlmutter the national director of the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith Nevertheless the book does have a thesis one that is thoroughly conditioned and limited by the authors own ideological blinders In effect they identify Jewish survival with the present economic and social order antiSemitism with attempts to change it Echoing neoconservatism and the centrist politics of most Jewish organizations the authors espouse a narrow pragmatic and frankly protectionist conception of Jewish interests focused on three priorities the survival of Israel which is equated with Israeli military strength and ability to resist any concessions to the Palestine Liberation Organization the preservation of the economic and professional status of Jews against demands for equality of result and the maintenance of American power as a bulwark against the antiSemitic Soviet Union and the antiZionist third world The real antiSemitism of the title is any policy that obstructs these aims whether or not its adherents are personally antiJewish Specifically the authors are worried about military aid to Arab nations pressure on Israel to make concessions for peace opposition to military spending and to American intervention abroad detente with the Russians and affirmative action quotas They argue that opposition to Jewish interests thus defined comes primarily from the left therefore Jews should rethink their traditionally liberal ideas and alliances Black people for instance are increasingly antiIsrael and proquota while fundamentalist Christians despite their penchant for antiJewish stereotypes and their doubts about the efficacy of Jewish prayer are solid allies on the far more crucial issue of Israel As for neoNazis and the Ku Klux Klan they are vicious to be sure but too marginal to be a real threat There would seem to be an obvious flaw in this logic oil As the Perlmutters readily acknowledge capitalism whose oil thirst is prodigious and whose ideology is profit has been largely responsible for inducing governments including ours to supply arms and make diplomatic concessions to the Arab world But this contradiction gives the authors little pause mainly because they regard multinational corporations as an interest group contending for political influence rather than the most powerful force shaping world politics As they see it the oilthirsty capitalists are betraying the true interests of American democracy which is a bit like accusing a dog of betraying the true interests of its tail This sort of muddleheadedness aside The Real AntiSemitism makes some valid points It is true that at present Jews have less to fear from overt antiSemitic malice than from impersonal institutional antiJewish bias It is also true that liberals and leftists have been guilty of perpetuating such bias under cover of a righteous concern for peace and justice Uncritical support of the PLO indifference to Israels vulnerability and insensitivity to Jews realistic fears about quotas all reflect the lefts refusal to take antiSemitism as seriously as other kinds of oppression But criticism of this refusal can be morally credible only if it takes other kinds of oppression as seriously as antiSemitism The Real AntiSemitism consistently fails to do this In discussing Israel the Perlmutters write as if the oppression of Palestinians were a myth invented by leftists in order to attack Israel and the United States They have nothing to say about the Palestinians situation Prime Minister Menachem Begins policies or their own ideas on how to resolve the IsraeliPalestinian conflict In 1982 these bland omissions are not just morally embarrassing  they insult the readers intelligence Similarly though the book discusses black antiSemitism at length it ignores racism and class bias among Jews as if Jewish resistance to the idea of economic equality were purely a matter of principle And as a Jewish woman I am appalled by the Perlmutters complacency about the Christian right Though half the Jewish and Israeli community is female they argue that feminist considerations should not deter Jews from seeking a proIsrael alliance with fundamentalists The survival of Israel they insist is the bottom line overriding all other issues Jews can live with restricted abortions Indeed societies have through the centuries THIS finally is the authors message Jews can live with any form of human misery that does not immediately and directly threaten annihilation As it happens access to abortion can be a matter of life or death but never mind Survival is all and it is sentimental to worry about survival for what or on whose terms Clearly this philosophy is meanspirited But does it make practical sense Like other Jews who put their faith in realism the Perlmutters ignore certain facts of Jewish history AntiSemitism feeds on human misery on social inequality Jews have always been the lightning rod for the rage of the oppressed Whenever they identify with power and rely on the protection of the powerful Jews set themselves up for this role Nor have their supposed protectors ever hesitated to protect themselves by sacrificing Jewish interests or for that matter Jewish lives the oilthirsty capitalists are behaving true to form If the Perlmutters imagine that defending American power can make the Jews or Israel safe they are far more sentimental than the liberals they chide
"WHEN REAGAN'S EX-CONSERVATIVES WON'T BE;
WASHINGTON - A huge tax hike. Flirting with Peking. The New Right agenda stymied by Congress.",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/opinion/when-reagans-exconservatives-wont-be-washington-a-huge-tax-hike.html,Many leading conservatives are increasingly critical of this Reagan record That Ronald Reagan and conservatives differ on some issues however should scarcely be surprising The conservative resurgence neither started with Mr Reagan nor will end with him The evidence is everywhere Americans are determined to reduce the size of government For all the prophecies of doom communities in California Massachusetts and elsewhere are surviving popularly mandated limits on state taxation Towns and cities seem to be having little trouble learning how to tighten belts And as predicted by tax revolt leaders like Howard Jarvis of California lower taxes have brought higher rates of economic growth and lower rates of unemployment Attitudes toward criminals continue to harden In the past halfdozen years about twothirds of the states have passed under great public pressure mandatorysentencing laws The grassroots profamily legions also show no signs of retreating to their kitchens or Kiwanis Clubs So powerful is the support for such matters as the traditional role of women and the right of parents without governments helping hand to raise their children that feminist leaders like Betty Friedan have begun urging their followers to avoid sounding antifamily Nor are Phyllis Schlaflys forces folding their tents now that they have defeated the Equal Rights Amendment They intend to hold officials accountable on such issues as abortion sex education and prayer in school Surveys consistently find at least 75 percent of the nation favoring a constitutional amendment permitting voluntary prayer in school As for abortion a majority OKs it only if the pregnancy was forced on the woman by rape or incest or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman This majority disappears however if the abortion is simply because the woman does not want the child Radicalism has faded away on college campuses ROTC is back as are recruiters for corporations and even for the FBI and CIA And colleges are also repudiating the lax standards that marked the 1970s Specific grades are replacing the permissive passfail and course requirements are being reestablished In some critical disciplines curricula have been changing profoundly Nowhere is this more dramatic than in economics where the teachings of John Maynard Keynes are being replaced by theories more emphatically emphasizing the marketplace This is extremely significant for Keynesianism had become however faithful to the intent of its founder a prescription for big spending and big deficits The University of Minnesota for example is still home to Walter Heller who after serving as John F Kennedys key economic adviser became Americas bestknown mostvisible Keynesian But today Dr Heller finds himself out of step with his departments glittering lights  Edward Prescott Thomas Sargent Christopher Sims Neil Wallace  all of whom have turned their backs on Keynes These varied traditionalist strands along with dramatic shifts toward Fundamentalism and evangelicalism in religion and the backtobasics movement in public education worry oldguard liberals like Douglas A Fraser president of the United Automobile Workers who voices concern that his auto workers in the near future will lose their enthusiasm for New Deal and Great Society programs Worried too are those younger liberals who are beginning to be known as neoliberals Correctly perceiving the grassroots shifts they conclude that to survive politically they must jettison the most prominent features of establishment American liberalism They are correct Though President Reagan disappoints conservatives on some key issues he fuels the conservative resurgence The block grant and new federalism initiatives for example shift program responsibilities closer to the grassroots In many Federal agencies Reagan appointees are reducing taxpayer funding of leftist organizations Not to be underestimated meanwhile is the impact of the White Houses bully pulpit in forging a new conventional wisdom that echoes the conservative agenda And if the Reagan Administration does nothing else it has brought scores of neoconservatives and New Rightists into the Government at middlelevel positions They are gaining the experience and what is more critical the credentials for senior and Cabinet posts in future administrations They and the conservativism that they represent are not going to end with Ronald Reagan
HIGH COURT FACING A DOCKET CROWDED WITH TOUGH ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/us/high-court-facing-a-docket-crowded-with-tough-issues.html,The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday with its docket both the most crowded in its history and the most politically charged in recent years Two groups of cases that have embroiled the Reagan Administration in controversy are before the Justices one on abortion rights and the other on the Federal tax status of private schools that discriminate on the basis of race Other decisions expected in the term could affect the future of the nuclear power industry and the growing market for videotape recorders The Court will try to decide whether a state may ban the construction of nuclear power plants and whether the home use of video recorders to tape television programs violates Federal copyright law The argument calendar contains 126 cases that the Justices accepted for review and carried over from the term that ended in July That number the highest ever means that the Courts available time for oral argument is already committed into February Cases From Summer List The Court sits for argument from October to the end of April Many of the remaining available argument slots may be filled Monday when the Justices announce which of the cases that reached the Court in the summer recess have been accepted The Justices spent five days last week in daylong meetings considering the 1011 cases on the summer list Not every case on the calendar is guaranteed to produce a decision For example the Justices may announce Monday that they will not rule after all on the constitutionality of the ratification process for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment The amendment died unratified on June 30 after the Court agreed to hear the appeal by the National Organization for Women from a lower court decision that the ratification process was invalid The Justice Department has asked the Court to dismiss the case as moot Nor are all 126 cases of widespread interest As much as half the docket is made up of statutory cases raising no constitutional issues that the Court feels obliged to hear so as to settle conflicts among the lower courts and give Federal law a uniform meaning throughout the country What follows are details of some of the more important cases due for decision in the term Civil Rights The Administration created a furor last January when it abandoned a 12yearold policy barring Federal tax exemptions for private schools that discriminate racially At the time the Court was due to hear a challenge to the old policy by two schools that base their discriminatory practices on their interpretation of the Bible The Justice Department was scheduled to defend the policy in oral argument last winter But the Administrations reversal changed all that The Court appointed an outside friend of the Court William T Coleman Jr to make the argument that the Administration no longer wanted to make in behalf of the policy The argument will be presented Oct 12 The cases Goldsboro Christian Schools and Bob Jones University v US Nos 811 and 813 raise both statutory questions under the Internal Revenue Code and the constitutional issue of the schools right to practice their religion without paying a Federal tax penalty In another case growing out of a discrimination suit by black and Puerto Rican officers against the New York City Police Department the Court will consider whether a key section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires proof of intentional discrimination The section Title VI prohibits discrimination in federally financed programs a category that covers many functions of state and local government The officers are arguing that Title VI is violated when a covered program has a discriminatory effect regardless of intent The Justice Department which supported the officers at an earlier stage of the case has not joined their Supreme Court appeal Guardians Assoc v Civil Service Commission No 81431 Abortion The abortion cases on the docket all raise questions about the extent to which state and local governments may impede access to legal abortion by imposing such requirements as hospitalization waiting periods or parental consent None of the cases which involve laws in Virginia Missouri and Akron Ohio directly challenge the Courts 1973 decision giving women a constitutional right to obtain abortions There is no inherent reason for the Justices to regard the cases as vehicles for reconsidering that ruling but interest is nonetheless intense on all sides of the issue The Reagan Administration reversed the Justice Departments longstanding practice of not getting involved in state abortion cases and filed a brief urging the Court to give heavy deference to the states desire to limit access to abortions Planned Parenthood v Ashcroft No 811255 Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health No 81746 Simopoulos v Virginia No 81185 State Authority In two cases that present important questions on the allocation of power between Washington and the states the Justice Department is arguing vigorously on the Federal Governments behalf The first case concerns Californias ban on the further construction of nuclear power plants a moratorium voted by the State Legislature in 1976 and intended to last until the Federal Government solved the problem of nuclear waste disposal A Federal appeals court upheld the ban The Justice Department joining an appeal by two utilities is arguing that the health and safety aspects of nuclear power are within the Federal Governments exclusive jurisdiction Pacific Gas  Electric v Calif No 811945 In the second case the Court will once again try to define the scope of the 10th Amendment which specifies that powers not explicitly conveyed by the Constitution to the Federal Government are reserved to the states The amendment has become a favorite of the New Right and the Court has given conflicting signals on what it means In the current case Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v Wyoming No 81554 the Government is appealing a lower court ruling that Congress violated the 10th Amendment when in 1974 it extended the Federal law against age discrimination to cover employees of state and local governments Video Recorders The Court will try to decide whether the Federal copyright law is violated by home use of videotape recorders Last year a Federal appeals court upheld the entertainment industrys contention that even the noncommercial inhome use of the machines violated the copyrights on the movies and programs recorded from television The decision set off a highstakes lobbying battle between the video recorder industry and Hollywood that may ultimately be resolved in Congress no matter what the Supreme Court decides in Sony v Universal City Studios No 811687 Free Speech The Court will hear two Federal appeals from lower court rulings that struck down Federal laws on First Amendment grounds One case US v Grace No 811863 concerns a law that prohibits picketing leafleting and demonstrating on Supreme Court property The other Bolger v Youngs Drug Products No 811590 concerns a Federal law that prohibits mailing unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives That law was challenged by a major manufacturer of contraceptives and could produce an important ruling on corporate free speech Election Law The Court will attempt to define the circumstances under which splinter or unpopular political groups are entitled to secrecy about their campaign finances despite laws requiring public disclosure The case Brown v Socialist Workers Party No 81776 involves an Ohio campaign law the Justices have also received a similar Federal case involving the Communist Party The Court will also consider whether Congressional districts must be as precisely equal in population as possible or whether small deviations are justified by other goals such as preserving minority voting strength The case Karcher v Daggett No 812057 grows out of this years reapportionment dispute in New Jersey but raises a question common to many other state reapportionment plans Criminal Law An appeal by a man accused of shoplifting who was found not guilty by reason of insanity raises a series of constitutional questions about the aftermath of a successful insanity defense The maximum jail term the man could have received was one year but he is still confined to a mental institution after nearly seven years because he has been unable to prove that he is no longer mentally ill or dangerous Among the questions raised by the case Jones v US No 815195 are whether the Government rather than the defendant should bear the burden of proof for release and whether those committed after insanity acquittals are constitutionally entitled to the same procedural protections as people committed after civil proceedings The Court will also try again to define the constitutional implications of the drug courier profile used by lawenforcement agents to spot likely narcotics suspects at airports In earlier cases the Justices were unable to agree on whether the profile justified an agents decision to detain a passenger against his will or even to stop and question a suspect Florida v Royer No 802146 In another airport case US v Place No 811617 the Court will attempt to define the degree of suspicion that agents must have before they can hold a passengers luggage long enough to expose it to a dog trained to detect narcotics The Court will also consider the constitutionality of a law permitting a drivers refusal to take a breathalyzer test to be introduced as evidence against the driver at a trial on drunken driving charges A number of states have such a law South Dakota v Neville No 811543 Legislative Veto Last term the Court deferred a ruling on the constitutionality of the legislative veto the process by which one or both houses of Congress can overturn a decision by an executive branch agency A decision is expected this year although it is not yet clear which of several pending cases the Court will choose to decide About 200 Federal laws contain legislative veto provisions and the
Supreme Court Blues,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/04/opinion/supreme-court-blues.html,Even before the Supreme Court calls the first case of its new term on this first Monday in October six of the nine justices hold that the Court is in trouble They spoke out individually during the summer recess each giving a useful glimpse into life atop the laws Olympus As usual with the increasingly splintered tribunal the justices disagree on the reasons for the malaise But all concur that one statistic is alarming 125 cases are already scheduled for full oral argument in this term The annual load should not go much above 150 cases if the justices are to give them the care that citizens expect of their highest court But petitions and appeals continue to roll in Cases accepted for review in November wont be heard until next October perhaps not decided until mid1984 More troubling than delay is the diminishing quality of the Courts final product Wordy opinions ghost written by law clerks get less and less editing by the harried jurists who sign their names to the prose The justices of the Burger Court behave less collegially than their predecessors and cant seem to resist disagreeing among themselves even when they vote for the same result This court outstrips all others in separate opinions and confusing judgments that command less than a majority for their governing principles Some justices blame the delays and the verbiage on the litigation explosion Others blame Congress for sloppy lawmaking that leaves the hard calls to the judiciary Still others blame the Court itself for mismanaging its docket All are right to some degree Yet the gloom can go too far The High Court despite generations of attack and controversy remains one of the worlds most trusted institutions Only last month the radical right wing in Congress failed to subvert the Courts abortion rulings or to strip it of authority on matters of religious liberty Justice John Paul Stevens who kicked off the summers debate with a remarkably candid speech at a bar convention leveled the mismanagement charge most effectively He pointed out that the Court makes extra work for itself by reaching out to correct lower court actions often before review is necessary and when no legal issue of national importance is involved Curiously he proposes a terrible cure a new court to decide which cases do warrant High Court attention A better remedy is embodied in a longpending and widely supported bill to increase the Courts discretion to deny requests for review More than 20 percent of the Courts argument calendar consists of cases where the law for one technical reason or another mandates a decision on the merits Many of these cases dont deserve the Supreme Courts attention The justices should be able to turn them aside without explanation and without making still more law in the process A little help from Congress plus a lot more care in selecting cases where the justices do have discretion could bring that bulge in the Courts docket within manageable range Another part of the solution also lies with the justices Without abandoning principle several of them could help by restraining their combativeness and occasionally withholding their separate opinions They might also revive a courtesy recalled by retired Justice Potter Stewart that the justices respond to each others draft opinions and inquiries promptly  within a day if possible A more collegial atmosphere could go a long way toward curing the blues on Olympus
A BLACK RESPONSIBILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/04/opinion/a-black-responsibility.html,The time has come for the black community to seriously confront the issue of teenage pregnancy Government studies concur that onethird of all girls and onehalf of all boys of all races become sexually active by their 16th birthday In 1978 teenagers were involved in about 55 percent of all outofwedlock births and 31 percent of all abortions More recently more than a million 15yearold to 19yearold girls have become pregnant each year twothirds of them unmarried And the numbers are increasing Since the early 1960s the proportion of outofwedlock babies born to older adolescents has risen by 40 percent An alarmingly high proportion of these teenage mothers are black Approximately 55 percent of all births to unwed girls under the age of 19 are to blacks and Hispanics Considering the much lower percentage of these nonwhites in the general population teenage pregnancy should be a matter of particular concern for the black community This is not to say that teenage pregnancy doesnt present difficult problems for any adolescent black or white Most teenage mothers of any race lack the crucial skills to fend for themselves and their infants because of their low age educational level and lack of maturity Eight out of 10 women who become pregnant at the age of 17 or younger never complete high school The result is often unemployment and dependency on welfare For blacks this syndrome of failure is aggravated by an already existing culture of poverty Consider the predicament of an adolescent black girl The only consequences of pregnancy that she may envision are the shortterm enticements of eligibility for welfare money and with it Governmentsubsidized independence She must be instructed by her elders to recognize the very different longterm consequences of teenage pregnancy poverty a welfare grant wont seem such a windfall after a year or two and sacrificed freedom of upward mobility An unmarried black woman with a child is not likely to break out of the ghetto The burden of responsibility to counsel adolescents facing this decision ought to fall more heavily on the black community I dont mean to pardon white racism  the kind that maintains the rigid segregation of black ghettos old and new But foundation grants and Federal intervention will be useless unless black communities resolve to do something for themselves Black leaders can begin this initiative by making unequivocally clear that it is wrong for teenagers to have babies out of wedlock Black leaders must say forthrightly to teenage girls If you get pregnant youll have a millstone around your neck for the rest of your life And they must say to teenage boys If you respect yourself you should have no reservation about assuming appropriate responsibility for yourself for your companion and for your unborn children Black parents too must teach their children at an early age how to conduct themselves responsibly Otherwise they condemn black children to a life of frustration In the past black communities have been ambivalent about familyplanning programs Coercive state legislative proposals and a major Federal initiative to get more black women to use birth control were interpreted as repressive and discriminatory Some critics even cried genocide But despite legitimate fears that such policies might be perverted into efforts by the white majority to control the size of the black population and inhibit freedom of choice for black mothers the epidemic of teenage pregnancy among blacks will only worsen if the problem is neglected by those who have the most at stake  the black community It serves no purpose to try to curtail discussion of the issue with the assertion that the system works against blacks and that pregancy among teenage blacks is the inevitable consequence of discrimination Discrimination is a crutch we must throw away Middleclass blacks must get involved  black fraternities and sororities black churches Elks Masons doctors and lawyers Those who have moved on to relative prosperity must return to the inner city and volunteer to work with organizations like the Urban League the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People the Opportunities Industrial Centers Operation Push and others that inspire young blacks to seek a better life Black professionals are role models who can wean young blacks off selfpity Teenage pregnancy must finally be recognized by those most deeply affected by the problem as selfdestructive Discrimination may have helped create the problem but only a strengthening of the black community and a reaffirmation of free will among black youth can help to eradicate it
SCIENCE WATCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/05/science/science-watch-199172.html,SCIENTISTS have reported growing mouse embryos under completely artificial conditions in laboratory dishes for 10 days fully half of their normal gestation period of about 20 days At the end of the experiments the limb buds that would become the animals forelegs were clearly visible the hind limb buds were beginning to appear and the minute bubblelike formations that would develop into eyes and ears could be seen clearly under the microscope The report from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health printed in the journal Science said the embryonic mice developed at the same pace as mouse embryos growing under normal circumstances in the womb Growth could not be maintained longer than 10 days but by that time the major divisions of the brain could be seen within the semitransparent embryo as well as the beginnings of such major organs as lungs liver and pancreas The report said the experiments were the first known to have successfully carried embryonic development in laboratory dishes to such an advanced stage as limb bud appearance The hearts of the embryos began to beat on day seven said the authors Dr LT Chen and Dr YC Hsu but blood circulation did not begin until the next day The experiments are designed to further scientists understanding of embryonic development and are considered potentially useful in research on the causes of spontaneous abortions and birth defects Dr Hsu is a pioneer in studies of embryonic and fetal development and was the first according to the university to grow mouse embryos successfully in laboratory dishes Dr Chen who collaborated in the research is now associate professor of medicine at the University of South Florida School of Medicine The culture dishes in which the mouse embryos were grown were kept supplied with oxygen and nutrients including fetal calf serum serum from human umbilical cord and rat blood serum according to the report The embryos are derived from mouse egg cells fertilized normally in the animal then transferred immediately to the laboratory dishes At the 10day point the only detectable difference between the ordinary embryos in the womb and the others was that the testtubegrown embryos were larger than normal
TENNESSEE SENATOR UPSET ABOUT KEY ABORTION VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/06/us/tennessee-senator-upset-about-key-abortion-vote.html,Im uneasy about it said Senator Jim Sasser Democrat of Tennessee When they keep pounding day after day with that stuff its going to stick with some people What makes the Senator uneasy is a vote he cast two weeks ago to break a tie in the Senate and defeat a bill that would have banned virtually all abortions Since then his opponent Representative Robin L Beard has hammered away at the issue Rightwing groups have made Senator Sasser a major target and one Beard staff member went around the state denouncing the incumbent as a murderer The outcome of this race offers one of the best opportunities this fall to measure the political impact of abortion and other social issues pressed by President Reagan and his more conservative allies such as Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina Question of Conservative Agenda The impact of these issues is important not only for the impending elections but also for the operations of Congress when it reconvenes in January After Senator Helms lost his fight on the abortion bill and on a subsequent measure to legalize officially sanctioned school prayer a number of Senators asserted that these issues had lost some of their impact with the voters A victory by Senator Sasser in the face of the current campaign would strengthen that conviction But a Beard triumph could frighten enough legislators to give the Helms forces a shot at passing the social issue agenda in the next Congress So far the general impression among politicians and analysts here is that the abortion vote hurt Senator Sasser but not fatally Most expect him to win but by a reduced margin The Beard attack has clearly caused a backlash here The Nashville Banner a conservative paper withdrew its endorsement of Mr Beard and cited the murderer charge as a reason Moreover even many supporters of the Republican challenger do not support the idea of Government intrusion into such personal matters as abortion Government Role Resented I dont think this issue is any of their business said Jim Long a businessman who is a Beard supporter as he wandered through the annual MidSouth Fair here with his wife and baby If you try to write rules on a piece of paper they dont fit everybody When it comes to an issue like this said Maurine Salisbury the wife of a retired boat captain the days when men dominate women are gone forever But Eddie Mahe a political consultant to the Beard campaign said that Representative Beard had cut Senator Sassers lead from more than 30 percentage points to 15 and he cited the abortion issue as one reason Senator Sassers visible role he said really brought home to the conservative Christian community that he is not prolife Senator Sasser agrees that there has been some erosion in his popularity and he notes that the Beard campaign is also peppering him for his stance on two other emotional social issues school prayer and busing for racial integration of schools He Voted With Helms on Prayer The Democrat says that his positions have been distorted that he supports the conservative line on both issues And in the recent school prayer fight he carefully voted with Senator Helms at every opportunity But Mr Sasser is worried that the whole cluster of issues will leave voters with a vague sense of discomfort about their Senator Obviously he said these attacks are calculated to go after the bluecollar workingclass people and fundamentalists who are Democratic voters in the South They are trying to portray me as unpatriotic and unAmerican and ungodly One reason Mr Sasser is expected to survive Mr Beards challenge is that he and other politicians have learned how to deal with the new political environment Two years ago many Democratic lawmakers were flustered and ineffective when faced with such rightwing attacks but now they generally agree that swift counterattack is the best strategy We now know that weve got to answer these charges said the Senator who flew home and held a news conference the day after being called a murderer If they go unanswered people will believe them he said So weve got to fight back

CONVICTED DOCTOR FIGHTS FOR LICENSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/06/us/convicted-doctor-fights-for-license.html,Massachusetts officials are considering whether to revoke the license of a doctor who served time in Federal prison after pleading guilty to indictments that said he had a malicious interest in making more money cutting his costs and saving his time in disregard for the life and health of his patients The doctor Dr Robert Julius Sherman now practices in a Boston suburb The states Board of Registration in Medicine is not expected to rule on revoking his license for at least a week But the hearing last week rekindled public doubts about the ability of government agencies and medical organizations to identify and discipline errant members He Moved in July 1981 Dr Sherman 69 years old practiced medicine in Washington DC before his license was ordered revoked there in 1977 He was jailed after pleading guilty in 1979 to charges of perjury in an agreement with the United States Attorney in Washington to drop a seconddegree murder charge That charge involved the death of a patient at his abortion clinic on March 4 1975 The patient Rita McDowell a 16yearold student was given an incomplete abortion by Dr Sherman and died in a Washington hospital four days later of infection Dr Sherman admitted to lying about these issues before a grand jury the District of Columbia licensing commission and civil courts  His failure to examine to determine whether the abortion was complete Prosecutors produced evidence that Dr Sherman deliberately performed incomplete abortions scheduled patients for followup procedures charging them 150 more  His performance of second trimester abortions and saline abortions as an outpatient procedure  His reuse of plastic syringes without sterilizing  His disposal of urine specimens of abortion patients without using them for tests for pregnancy  His allowing a nurses aide to perform minor surgery  His coverup of his role in the death of Miss McDowell by tampering with her medical records and fabricating an appointment book phone message and officeprocedures manual In July 1981 having served 22 months of a prison sentence of 60 to 90 months he moved back to Massachusetts where he had gone to school and earned a license in 1939 Delay in Hearing Discussed It was one of the cases we thought should be acted on said George Annas a lawyer who ended a sixyear stint with the Massachusetts Licensing Board last December Yet a hearing for the case was not scheduled until 28 months after the board filed its initial complaint against Dr Sherman then in Federal prison in Kentucky Six months to a year is average Mr Annas said The boards counsel James Barrett who is representing the boards case against Dr Sherman refused to comment on the timing of the hearings which were scheduled a few days after an article in People Magazine on July 26 titled License to Kill identified Dr Sherman as being in Boston Dr Sherman stated at last weeks hearing that he was strictly in general practice in Brookline I have no part of abortion he said Dr Shermans Massachusetts license was automatically renewed last January despite an order for him to show cause why it should not be revoked The month before the head of the licensing board received a letter of conditional support for Dr Sherman from Dr Stanley Wyman then president of the Massachusetts Medical Society requesting a most careful and thorough review and consideration for Dr Sherman The letter said If the facts are as he states them it would appear that he has been very seriously wronged Letter Draftd AfterMeeting The societys executive vice president Dr William Munier said he drafted the letter on the basis of a halfhour meeting with Dr Sherman We made a bad judgment says Dr Wyman who said he never saw Dr Sherman We were duped Mr Annas the lawyer formerly associated with the licensing board cited lack of resources not anything nefarious as the cause of the boards delay It happens and it happens with embarrassing regularity he said The medicine board has only two investigators who both quit recently He Says Lawyers Advised Him In his case before the board Dr Sherman maintained that his guilty pleas were not an admission of perjury but simply a part of a bargain to spare himself the ordeal of another murder trial after the first ended in a mistrial Dr Sherman asserted that he acted purely on the advice of lawyers Dr Sherman also said he was innocent in the highly publicized case of Miss McDowell whose death he ascribed to treatment she received at General Hospital in the District of Columbia Saying he was a victim of legal malpractice he sued his lawyer for having him sign a concession of negligence in a civil case brought against him by Miss McDowells family This was settled out of court for 525000 I believe he was persecuted Dr Karl Jonas a Washington surgeon and former colleague said last week in a telephone interview Dr Jonas last year wrote a strong letter of recommendation for Dr Sherman asserting that Dr Sherman had treated the poor patients no one else wanted because their fees came only from Medicaid payments He was taking care of a group of patients that most doctors wouldnt touch with a 10foot pole Dr Jonas said You cant practice a carriage trade on them He was casual undoubtedly too casual possibly careless but certainly not criminal

Regarding Positions On Abortion Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/nyregion/l-regarding-positions-on-abortion-funds-204434.html,A flood of phone calls to the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion followed a misleading statement in the article on Westchesters State Senate races Democrats See Uphill State Senate Battle Sept 26 It said that the incumbents Joseph Pisani John Flynn and Mary B Goodhue had voted to maintain the states use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortion although all three said that they were morally opposed to abortion In fact Mr Pisani and Mr Flynn each voted five times in 1982 for amendments offered by the antiabortion leader Senator James Donovan to remove Medicaid moneys from the state budget Both have voted consistently to cut off Medicaid financing of abortion each year since the cutoff was first introduced in 1978 Both have stated to me many times over the years that they are unalterably opposed to Medicaid coverage of abortion Both have cosponsored and voted for another avenue to take the option of abortion from the states needy women  a change in state social services law to specifically exclude abortion This year Mr Pisani and Mr Flynn after all hope of removing abortion financing was exhausted did vote to pass the New York State budget This is not to be interpreted as a prochoice vote In fact for other reasons some strongly prochoice Senators voted against the budget Both Mr Flynn and Mr Pisani support a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion Both have cosponsored and voted for constitutional convention resolutions on the subject of a human life amendment to the Constitution New York State Medicaid has covered pregnant women since its inception When abortion was legalized Medicaid automatically included abortion thereby ending the shameful era when medically safe abortions were reserved for those who could pay The Medicaid cutoff is in effect a bribe for the states poor to bear children because Medicaid would continue to pay for pregnancy and childbirth if abortion financing were denied During the time that New Jersey cut off abortion financing there was a 30 percent increase in births to Medicaideligible women Cutting off financing for poor womens abortions is unfair and cruel The wisdom and compassion of Mr Pisani and Mr Flynn are surely called into question by their votes against abortion rights As the article reported both Susan Oppenheimer who is challenging Mr Pisani in the 1982 elections and Patrick Pilla who is challenging Mr Flynn are unequivocally prochoice and support the option of legal abortion for all women who need it regardless of income POLLY ROTHSTEIN Director Westchester Coalition For Legal Abortion  The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication should include the writers name address and telephone number Letters should be addressed to The Editor Westchester Weekly The New York Times 229 West 43d Street New York NY 10036 Because of the large volume of mail received we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or return unpublished letters

DEMOCRATS EXPECT TO WIN MORE GOVERNORS' RACES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/11/us/democrats-expect-to-win-more-governors-races.html,Democrats who now control 27 of the nations 50 governors offices stand a good chance of increasing their margin over Republicans in the Nov 2 elections according to officials in both parties They say the Democrats are likely to win back some of the large states in the Middle West that Republicans have controlled in recent years including Ohio Michigan and Minnesota Yet which party wins or loses in power and influence in American government depends to a large degree the officials say on the outcome of volatile races in four major states across the country California Texas Illinois and New York All four are considered close or subject to change in the three weeks remaining in the campaigns Thirtysix states are electing governors this year and although party labels in many states no longer signify much about the political philosophy of the candidates the contests are considered important in the national context for two reasons First the party that controls the governors offices in states with the greatest electoral votes will have an advantage in the 1984 Presidential election because of a governors power to organize the state for his party Will Affect New Federalism Second President Reagans chances of carrying out the new federalism his proposal to transfer power from the national Government to the states would be enhanced by the election of more Republicans in the major statehouses or thwarted by a preponderance of Democrats according to White House officials Disagreement between the White House and the present governors about the division of reponsibilities between Washington and the states has brought a stalemate in negotiations Along with their 27to23 numerical edge Democrats now control such large states as New York California Florida and Massachusetts But Republicans control Texas New Jersey Pennsylvania and most of the states in the Middle West Republicans acknowledge that the Democrats have the advantage in this years elections Richard Bond deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee pointed out that in the eight offyear elections since 1950 the party in control of the White House suffered an average net loss of six governors offices In 1974 when Gerald R Ford was President his party lost five and in 1978 when Jimmy Carter was President the Democrats lost six Mr Bond said his party was hopeful of keeping Republican losses this year below the average and of picking up some large states from the Democrats Democrat Very Encouraged On the other hand Charles T Manatt chairman of the Democratic National Committee said he was very encouraged about prospects of scoring impressive gains in the Middle West and West and of holding on to New York and California where the Republicans are concentrating much of their national campaign resources Leaders of both parties acknowledge that there are a number of races that could go either way and that the campaigns are centered less on the national economic situation than are the Congressional races Many of them are being fought on local issues or personalities In Iowa for instance it was disclosed this summer that the Democratic candidate Roxanne Conlin had taken advantage of tax shelters she had denounced And in Connecticut Republicans seized on allegations of corruption in the Transportation Department in their campaign against Gov William A ONeill and other Democrats Much of the campaign debate has been grim centering on how to stem the loss of jobs control crime and increase services without raising taxes Nevertheless the question of how to deal with the results of the recession on the state level has been a prime issue in many races one that seems to be cutting more against the Republicans than the Democrats In Oregon Gov Victor G Atiyeh who a few months ago seemed assured of reelection has found himself in a close race with Ted Kulongoski a Democratic State Senator who says the Governor has not acted boldly against unemployment An Edge in Middle West And the economy is clearly giving Democrats an edge they would not have otherwise had in the Middle West which has seen a depression in both farming and manufacturing In the 1978 election the Republicans virtually locked up that region with promises of government austerity and limits on taxes But as the recession deepened and tax revenues declined they were forced to cut back services and in some states such as Ohio and Minnesota to raise taxes so as to wipe out deficits Five Governors  William G Milliken of Michigan Albert H Quie of Minnesota Robert Ray of Iowa Lee S Dreyfus of Wisconsin and James A Rhodes of Ohio  declined to run for reelection This gave Democrats opportunities they had not expected In Michigan where Republicans have held the governors office for two decades Democrats patched up their divisions and nominated Representative James J Blanchard for governor According to sources in both parties Mr Blanchard held a substantial lead last week over Richard H Headlee a conservative businessman who upset Lieut Gov James Brickley a moderate in the Republican primary In Minnesota former Gov Rudy Perpich who is known as a maverick won a tough primary fight for the Democrtic nomination partly through his opposition to abortion and gun control According to several polls he has been leading the Republican candidate Wheelock Whitney a wealthy businessman And in Ohio former Lieut Gov Richard F Celeste who narrowly lost the governorship to Mr Rhodes in 1978 was reported holding a substantial lead over the Republican candidate Representative Clarence J Brown Illinois Race in Doubt Officials in both parties said Gov James R Thompson of Illinois had been leading former Senator Adlai E Stevenson 3d in a race based more on contrasting personalities than issues But Democratic officials and independent observers citing increased Democratic registrations said Mr Stevenson could still win if Democrats turn out to vote in good numbers A close race was reported in Nebraska where a young novice to politics and former antiwar activist Bob Kerrey is trying to unseat Gov Charles Thone a Republican and a longtime officeholder Another close contest is in Kansas where the lone Democratic Governor of the Middle West John Carlin is on the defensive because of hard times and his proposal for an oil and gas severance tax Governor Carlins opponent is Sam Hardage a Wichita real estate developer The outcome was also unclear in Wisconsin where Terry J Kohler a businessman and son of a former governor is running on the Republican ticket against Anthony S Earl who served as director of natural resources when Patrick J Lucey was Governor Although the tax shelter issue used against Mrs Conlin in Iowa has receded somewhat Lieut Gov Terry Branstad a Republican was given the edge by sources in both parties And Gov William J Janklow of South Dakota was reported safe for reelection on the Republican ticket More Stable in Northeast The situation was more stable in the Northeast Holding comfortable leads for reelection were Govs Joseph E Brennan of Maine J Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island Harry R Hughes of Maryland all Democrats Richard A Snelling of Vermont and Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania both Republicans Former Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts who defeated the conservative Gov Edward J King in the primary had what most of those in Massachusetts political circles felt was an insurmountable lead over his Republican opponent John W Sears In Connecticut Governor ONeill was reported leading his Republican challenger Lewis B Rome but Republican partisans insisted that the lead was small enough to be overcome The picture was even more unclear in New Hampshire where Gov Hugh Gallen a Democrat was facing a stiff challenge from John N Sununu a Tufts University professor of engineering who took the usual conservative pledge in that state not to enact a sales or income tax despite revenue shortfalls Mr Gallen declined to take the same pledge In New York leaders in both parties said the race between Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo and Lewis E Lehrman was close Little Change Seen in South In the South not much change was expected either in ideological or party preference Govs Bob Graham of Florida Richard W Riley of South Carolina both Democrats and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee a Republican were considered safe for reelection Former Gov Bill Clinton of Arkansas a moderate was widely expected to unseat the highly conservative Republican Governor who unseated him two years ago Frank D White In Georgia the strong tradition of electing Democrats was expected to prevail again with Joe Frank Harris a surprise winner in the Democratic primary prevailing over his Republican opponent State Senator Robert H Bell Mr Harris promises a conservative contrast to the moderate views of Gov George Busbee who is retiring and of his predecessor Jimmy Carter The race in Alabama between former Gov George C Wallace and the conservative Republican Mayor of Montgomery Emory Folmar has most political experts baffled Most give the edge to Mr Wallace but Mr Folmar is an effective campaigner with lots of money to spend and is not taken lighly by Democrats In the Southwest some Texans have been surprised by the strong showing of Attorney General Mark White a Democrat against Gov William P Clements Jr who seemed assured of reelection a few months ago Both are toughminded conservatives who are at odds over internal issues and some aspects of the economy While Mr Clements is still generally favored Democrats elsewhere in the country are pouring resources into the state in hopes of an upset Close in Wyoming and Idaho Elsewhere in the West and Southwest three Democratic Governors are reported virtually assured of reelection George Nigh of Oklahoma Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Richard D Lamm of Colorado But in two states where Reagan Republicanism has been strong Democratic Governors John Evans of Idaho and Ed Herschler of Wyoming are in close races In Nevada where both parties are conservative Gov Robert F List a Republican has been trailing former Attorney General Richard Bryan In California Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles a Democrat was the clear leader in recent polls over Attorney General George Deukmejian but the outcome is uncertain because of the volatility of California politics and the fact that Mr Bradley is black Gov George Ariyoshi is expected to win reelection in Hawaii In Alaska a close race is reported between Republican Thomas A Fink a former Speaker of the state House of Representatives and William Sheffield an Anchorage hotel owner Gubernatorial

NOW ELECTS OFFICERS AND PLOTS ITS FUTURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/11/style/now-elects-officers-and-plots-its-future.html,After a spirited race the National Organization for Women announced today its new slate of officers elected at the organizations 15th annual convention These officers will navigate the largest womens rights organization in the country in redefining its goals after the defeat of the equal rights amendment The new president is Judy Goldsmith 43 years old of Manitowoc Wis Currently vice presidentexecutive of NOW she was unofficially supported by Eleanor C Smeal the outgoing president and won after fending off a strong challenge by Sonia Johnson the equal rights amendment proponent who was excommunicated from the Mormon Church for her activism The other officers are vice presidentexecutive Barbara Timmer 35 of Washington counsel to a subcommittee of the House of Representatives vice presidentaction Mary Jean Collins 43 of Chicago former president of Chicago NOW secretary Kathy Webb 32 of Little Rock Ark a sales management executive and a member of the NOW board who developed several chapters in Arkansas and Alice Chapman the incumbent treasurer who was reelected Mrs Goldsmiths victory was taken as a mandate to continue the pragmatic actionoriented programs of her predecessor In addition the delegates debated a grab bag of resolutions for action that will in large measure determine the future NOW priorties Thirty proposals their topics ranging from older women to school prayer from nuclear weapons to economic empowerment were recommended by the delegates in hearings Approved by the Resolutions Committee and submitted to a plenary session for ratification only five of the 30 were passed before the convention adjourned late this afternoon They were the following  A resolution was approved to organize a campaign to outlaw sex discrimination in insurance including sexdifferentiated price schedules  Delegates approved a campaign against the Federal human life amendment and human life bill that would abolish abortion rights The campaign would be aimed at stopping rightwing attacks on birth control amniocentesis and other reproductiive rights and would work to defeat far right and other antiwoman legislators in the 1984 election  Another resolution called for increased efforts to draw minority women into the organization and onto its professional staff and increased efforts to address problems of violence and disenfranchisement that minority women experience  The organization voted to work in a variety of ways to eradicate inequitable treatment of lesbians  The convention approved a measure to promote the use of consciousnessraising techniques in order to familiarize new members of NOW with various forms of injustice Decisions on the other resolutions will be made by the NOW national board including the one that would establish an institute for feminist politics The institute would recruit and train candidates and campaign staff and support elected feminist legislators The future course of the organization was charted during three days of intense but rarely divisive debates workshops hearings and plenary sessions in which 1827 delegates and 1173 observers sifted through dozens of issues on the economy political mobilization reproductive rights labor and employment They also discussed how NOW can expand its membership to one million before the 1984 elections form new local chapters and revitalize existing ones Leaders and rankandfile members said that the movement had reached a turning point with the defeat on June 30 of the equal rights amendment If so it was turning decisively to the political arena with the avowed intention of supporting public officials who promote womens rights and of actively campaigning against those who dont For the foreseeable future NOW will concentrate on restoring Democrats to power Reproductive Rights Mrs Smeal the president who leaves office on Dec 1 said The Republicans defeated the equal rights amendment The vast majority of the opposition for reproductive rights comes from the GOP side of the aisle But an even more critical consideration she said is public officials record on the Reagan economic program Millicent Fenwick must be judged on the fact that she votes on economic matters Mrs Smeal said referring to the decision of New Jersey NOW to endorse Frank R Lautenberg the Democratic candidate for United States Senator rather than Mrs Fenwick despite her generally favorable record on feminist rights The Reagan economic program has done enormous damage to women Mrs Smeal said Money has become the excuse for slashing programs that comprise only a tiny portion of the Federal expenditure The Administration for example doesnt believe in affirmative action so it attacks it in failure to endorse regulations in appointments and in funding They are trying to destroy it through the budget Political Action Committees One of the more potent political weapons being developed by the organization is the political action committee or PAC The NOW PAC has been formed to aid in Federal races the NOW Equality PAC for state and local elections All told the political action committees have collected 2 million so far and hope to receive another 1 million before the November election NOW plans to contribute 15 million to candidates and the rest to the new feminist political institute NOWs increased political sophistication was demonstrated in a workshop on PACs Mrs Smeal the workshop moderator said I worry about the purist notion that we can look at a candidate only on the basis of our issues Sometimes it is better to save someone who is not always with us in order to block someone who is worse It is imperative to understand how voting for a particular individual might prevent someone undesirable from assuming a committee chairmanship for example Molly Yard a NOW political expert told the audience It is idealistic to knock on every door to get out the vote But that is not your objective It is to elect your candidate and hope that your enemies are sick on election day Involvement in Campaigns When the group was asked how many of the 80 or so people attending the session were involved in campaigns more than threequarters of the hands went up One of the women attending Myrt Klukas the South Dakota state coordinator for NOW exemplifies the new approach Mrs Klukas is running for South Dakota Secretary of State Although her tasks will deal mainly with voter registration and corporations she said I cannot divorce myself from being a feminist in anything I do New York NOW members contended their efforts have already been felt in a number of campaigns particularly the victory of Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo in the Democratic primary for Governor NOW women have been used to work in campaigns before but we were like little brown field mice nobody knew we were there Denise Fuge president of NOW New York City said Now candidates are coming to us Despite the intensity of the sessions there were moments of sentiment at the convention Although she stays in office until Dec 1 Mrs Smeal received an emotional farewell that culminated with hundreds of women snaking their way through the cavernous hall singing We will never give up we will never give in There were moments of humor too Members of the Connecticut delegation interrupted one plenary session and a woman calling herself Mrs John Phyllis Shaft said Two things led to the womens movement  birth control and permanent press clothing Pregnancy and ironing are our natural state Everyone laughed
"MRS. SULLIVAN AND MOYNIHAN TRADE CHARGES; Excerpts from debate, page B5.",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/nyregion/mrs-sullivan-and-moynihan-trade-charges-excerpts-from-debate-page-b5.html,The major candidates for United States Senator from New York argued over defense spending yesterday and accused each other of being unfair in discussing it Politely but persistently an animated Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan demanded numbers and definitions from his opponent Assemblywoman Florence M Sullivan Hurriedly looking through a heap of notes she sometimes complied with his directions sometimes counterattacked sometimes complained He challenged her at one point to produce a document to support her earlier contention that he had voted against 26 billion for defense I havent got it she replied You havent got it because it doesnt exist said Mr Moynihan And it was not a very fair statement he added Moments later Mrs Sullivan shook her head Talking about being unfair she said The Senator had implied in an earlier meeting that he shared inside information with President Reagan about Russian military might she complained  And that she said was not true Mrs Sullivan said she agreed that President Reagan in playing catchup with the Russians with respect to defense needed an annual spending rise of about 7 percent Mr Moynihan urged 5 percent Mr Moynihan seeking a second term as the DemocraticLiberal candidate and Mrs Sullivan who represents the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn in the Assembly and is the Republican Conservative and Right to Life candidate were questioned by editors and reporters at The New York Times They agreed essentially on a variety of topics  both deploring Federal deficits urging aid for jobless people criticizing American support for defaulted loans by Poland and praising President Reagans formula for Middle East peace But twice the Senator a former college professor leaned forward frowned over the top of his reading glasses and admonished Mrs Sullivan as if she were a dull student once on her defense spending charge once when she said altered actuarial policies might help keep the Social Security system solvent I dont know what youre talking about Mr Moynihan said This is not the Prudential Life Insurance Company This is the United States Government He turned to Mrs Sullivan seated at his right Actuarial policies should be followed he asked Yes she said What does that mean he asked I am not a member of the insurance industry she replied as she riffled through a pile of notes Im just talking about different ideas that have been suggested The Senator also attempted a professorandpupil type of quiz on the definition of a nuclear weapon For a few moments Mrs Sullivan attempted answers Then she said Senator Moynihan if you want to get that technical I think we should have another debate on nuclear weapons and Ill have all the information about nuclear weapons Previous Charges Revived Mr Moynihan frowned Is it technical he asked for someone who wants to be a United States Senator not to know what a nuclear weapon is Each revived charges that arose last week during a televised debate on foreign policy After that meeting Mr Moynihan retreated from a contention that private information had buttressed his denial that the Soviet Union was ahead of the United States militarily And Mrs Sullivan promised to document her contention that the Senator had voted against 26 billion for defense Yesterday the Senator said he had not meant to imply that his argument about comparative military might was based on inside information Mrs Sullivan said she had not yet come up with documentation on his defense votes Ill get it for you she promised Kind Words for Reagan Mr Moynihan spoke more kindly than Mrs Sullivan about President Reagan calling him a unifying President She said that the President had not worked a miracle but that we cannot go back to the policies that we had under President Carter Toward the end of the oneandahalfhour session they expressed differing views in a rapid runthrough of a series of ideological issues Did they support school prayer Yes I do said Mrs Sullivan Mr Moynihan said he opposed stripping the Constitution by proposals to deny court review of schoolprayer cases Medicaid funds for abortions Im in favor said Mr Moynihan I am opposed said Mrs Sullivan A Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion Im against said Mr Moynihan Im for said Mrs Sullivan The death penalty For it said Mrs Sullivan Mr Moynihan said he favored it in very rare circumstances A Nod to Carter Of President Reagans proposal for a Middle Eastern settlement Mr Moynihan said it was not different from the Camp David agreements Mrs Sullivan agreed She said President Jimmy Carter took a very important first step with the Camp David accord and praised President Reagan for his timing in taking this very important second step They disagreed though over the outcome of the subsequent Arab meeting at Fez Mrs Sullivan called the statement that followed it encouraging Mr Moynihan called it a rejection of our proposal and said that the United States should not be casual in its reaction If Iran wins its war with Iraq he said the United States should warn neighboring Arab nations that there was only one country that could save them from the Ayatollah and thats us Toward the close of the debate each candidate was asked for an ideological selfdescription That too started an argument Mr Moynihan described himself as a moderate Democrat within the tradition of John F Kennedy Where he came from he said youre born a Democrat and youre baptized a Catholic Mrs Sullivan read a statement by Mr Moynihan in which he had described himself as a liberal Well so was Harry Truman he said Whats the matter with that Thats what Democrats are Liberals said Mrs Sullivan Yeah yeah said Mr Moynihan Thats right Then he read a statement from Mrs Sullivan describing her candidacy as the final conflict between whats left of the old RockefellerJavits segment of the GOP and the new team of Reaganites I am a conservative Republican Mrs Sullivan said
A CLASH OF IDEOLOGIES IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/nyregion/a-clash-of-ideologies-in-the-campaign-for-governor-news-analysis.html,This is the great divide in New York politics the voters of New York have not had so clear a choice in a generation Lewis E Lehrman declared last week in his first debate with his Democratic rival for governor Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo Many politicians including campaign aides of both Mr Lehrman and Mr Cuomo agree on the basis of the first two weeks of the gubernatorial election campaign since the primary I cannot recall as sharply divided an ideological contest since GoldwaterJohnson in 1964 said Raymond B Harding the Liberal Party leader The ideological gap is particularly unusual in New York e Candidates here historically have tended to blur any such differences to the point where there was little ideological division between such Republicans as Gov Nelson A Rockefeller Gov Thomas E Dewey and former Assembly Leader Perry B Duryea and such Democrats as Gov W Averell Harriman Governor Carey and Arthur J Goldberg the former Supreme Court Justice Two years ago even Alfonse M DAmato who ran for the United States Senate as a conservative in the Republican primary against thenSenator Jacob K Javits shifted toward the center in the general election Both Camps Claim Mainstream However both the Lehrman and Cuomo camps are claiming they are in the states political mainstream Mr Cuomo and his supporters argue that he is in the tradition of New York Democratic and Republican governors for more than half a century Just because Lehrman is far to the right doesnt make us far to the left said Patrick Caddell the Cuomo pollster But Lehrman supporters argue that the mainstream has shifted Its the era and its what he believes said Judah Sommer a former top Javits aide and now a Lehrman advisor I think that whats happened is the socalled conservative issues like the death penalty and tax reduction have become consensus issues said Roger Stone the political consultant who ran the Reagan campaign here in 1980 Other than an apparent move away from President Reagan whose economic programs are not faring well in various polls Mr Lehrman has not shifted his conservative position between the primary and election campaigns In fact the RepublicanConservative candidate called last week for a cut of 40 percent in the state income tax over eight years and a halving of the state sales tax the most drastic tax proposal by a serious politician in the state in years Brochure Points Up Differences The first mass mailing of the Lehrman campaign for the November election illustrated the ideological differences The brochure emphasized Mr Lehrmans support of the death penalty and declared that Mr Cuomo wants to continue coddling criminals How important is the crime issue Mr Lehrman said in an interview that he himself would not choose a candidate just on that issue but that I would respect those who did The Lehrman brochure went on to point up four other issues that show the sharp ideological split between the two candidates tuition tax credits for parochial schools voluntary prayer in schools removing ablebodied persons from welfare rolls and using taxpayers money to pay for abortions Mr Lehrman has taken the conservative side on each of these issues Cuomo Labeled Extreme Liberal The brochure also said Mr Cuomo that provide for reverse discrimination on grounds of race Mr Lehrman who describes himself as a moderate conservative has attacked Mr Cuomo as an extreme liberal Mr Cuomo in turn repeatedly portrayed Mr Lehrman as a Reagan Republican in their first debate last week and in several speeches There has been no focus on Lew Lehrmans ideology we have to focus that issue immediately said Mr Caddell explaining his candidates linking of the President and Mr Lehrman in the debate At the same time Mr Cuomo who ran to the left of Mayor Koch in the Democratic primary with its more liberal electorate has not noticeably shifted either More than Democratic candidates have in recent years he still emphasizes the plight of the poor and the disabled identifies himself with labor and even the Democratic Party of the past and a politics that raised up a whole generation that raised it up from poverty to the middle class Who was right  Roosevelt or Hoover Mr Cuomo asked an obviously receptive audience at a Democratic State Committee dinner 10 days ago Who was right  Kennedy or Nixon he went on In 1980 President Reagan and Senator DAmato broke the moderatetoliberal pattern of the past by winning New York although in both cases they were involved in threeway races rather than direct confrontations The CuomoLehrman election will help determine whether the 1980 results in New York were a departure from a pattern or the start of a new pattern
2 SWEDES AND BRITON WIN NOBEL FOR CLUES TO BODY'S CHEMISTRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/science/2-swedes-and-briton-win-nobel-for-clues-to-body-s-chemistry.html,Two Swedes and an Englishman won the Nobel Prize for medicine yesterday for their discoveries in controlling prostaglandins a natural substance implicated in a wide range of human and animal illness The Swedish winners were Dr Sune Bergstrom 66 years old and Dr Bengt Samuelsson 48 who started their research in partnership as teacher and student at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm The Englishman was Dr John R Vane 55 who has been research director of the Wellcome Foundation in Beckenham England since 1973 The announcement was made in Stockholm by the faculty of the Karolinska Institute The three 1982 winners were in Boston yesterday at a meeting celebrating the 200th anniversary of the founding of Harvard Medical School They were there to report on their latest findings in the area for which they received the award prostaglandins which form the basis of a complex and extensive biological system Only in recent years have scientists begun to recognize and understand the significance of prostaglandins Research in the field has already led to a great many health benefits from correcting birth defects to reduction of pain caused by a variety of diseases and injuries All three Nobel winners expressed delight and surprise when they were informed of the award I had no idea Dr Samuelsson said Dr Bergstrom who is chairman of the Nobel Foundation Board and had long been mentioned as a possible candidate said You are always surprised Prostaglandins are fatty acids formed in cells throughout the body especially in periods of illness stress or injury The three scientists and others have found that these substances have a bewildering array of effects on muscles nerves cells fluids and body temperature Prostaglandins play an important role in the functioning or malfunctioning of cells It was actually another Swedish Nobel laureate Dr Ulf S von Euler who was once Dr Bergstroms teacher who named the substances prostaglandins in the mid1930s after he first detected them in seminal fluid and assumed that they came from the prostate gland Although the prostate has a rich supply of prostaglandins they have been found throughout the body and the original name has persisted Dr Bergstrom said he began his research on prostaglandins in 1947 at the suggestion of Dr von Euler and spent some time trying to isolate and purify prostaglandin from the glands of Icelandic sheep However he said that he put the project aside largely for technical reasons until 1956 The Nobel citation credited Dr Bergstrom for his crucial breakthroughs in the 1960s when he purified several prostaglandins determined their chemical structure and showed that they were formed from unsaturated fatty acids Dr Samuelsson was cited for giving a detailed picture of arachidonic acid from which all the various types of prostaglandins  and there are dozens  are created He was also cited for clarifying the chemical processes involved in the formation and the bodys use of prostaglandins and for discovering various prostaglandin subtypes Dr Vane working independently was cited for discovering the subtype prostaglandin X which is now called prostacyclin It affects the activity of platelets that form the kind of blood clots that may lead to heart attacks and strokes His research has led to a new avenue of study in the cause and prevention of heart attacks the major killer in the United States and most industrialized countries as well as the effects of arteriosclerosis For example Norwegian surgeons earlier this year reported that they had injected prostaglandin I2 into the artery of a 75yearold man to salvage his leg that was on the verge of becoming gangrenous from advanced arteriosclerosis Dr Vane also was recognized for making one of the most remarkable advances in the prostaglandin field discovering that aspirin almost completely blocks the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid That discovery helped explain why aspirin is so effective in treating fever pain inflammation and other conditions New Treatments Are Developed Prostaglandin research has led to a variety of important new treatments for human and veterinary medicine Drugs have been found to counteract the formation of prostaglandins when there is too much of them in the body or when their effects are unwanted Such drugs are used to reduce menstrual pain and to help relieve the pains of gall stones and kidney stones the Karolinska Institute said in its citation In another application pediatricians can now correct a common birth defect among premature infants by injecting a drug during the first few days of life instead of doing major heart surgery The heart defect is called patent ductus arteriosus The drug is called indomethacin which is known to stop the synthesis of prostaglandins They play an important role in keeping the duct patent as it was when the infant was in the womb instead of closing as it is supposed to do shortly after birth Prostaglandins also have been used as a chemical means of inducing abortions and researchers have been studying the role of prostaglandins in human reproduction Dr Bergstrom working closely with the World Health Organization has been a leader in that field Researchers are investigating the effects of prostaglandins in such a wide range of areas as heart disease intestinal disorders pregnancy cancer fevers and sunburns The list of prostaglandins as well as their hormonelike effects has been expanding rapidly in recent years Most cells contain enzymes that can synthesize as well as degrade prostaglandins many of which are rapidly destroyed in the lungs often before the blood has had time to make one complete circulation through the body The most recently discovered members of the prostaglandin family are called leukotrienes and they are formed only in a few tissues and cells chiefly the lungs and white blood cells Release of leukotrienes in allergic and inflammatory disorders is thought to govern the symptoms that characterize asthma and similar disorders Dr Vane predicted yesterday that the knowledge would lead to the development of new drugs for such disorders Research at Columbia In previous interviews in Stockholm and in this country Dr Bergstrom said that the story of prostaglandins really had its origins at Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1930 There Dr Raphael Kurzrok Dr Charles C Lieb and Sarah Ratner had noted that the human womb would either strongly contract or relax when fresh human semen was inserted as part of pioneering attempts in the treatment of infertility The New York researchers apparently did not follow up on their observation But through the work of the Nobel laureates the effect the Columbia doctors observed is now known to stem from prostaglandins present in the seminal fluid Yesterdays award was the first since 1973 and the 10th since World War II in which an American scientist did not share in a Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine It was also the first of this years Nobel awards Each laureate will receive 157000 in ceremonies held in Stockholm on Dec 10 the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel the inventor of dynamite whose will created the awards that have been given since 1901
EXCERPTS FROM CAMPAIGN DEBATE BY SENATOR MOYNIHAN AND MRS. SULLIVAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/nyregion/excerpts-from-campaign-debate-by-senator-moynihan-and-mrs-sullivan.html,Following are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times between Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a DemocratLiberal who is seeking election to his second term and Assemblywoman Florence M Sullivan his challenger from the Republican Conservative and Right to Life Parties Social Security Q Id like to ask you about Social Security How much trouble do you think the system is in MOYNIHAN The Social Security system is in more trouble today than it was two years ago when the President first proposed a 40 percent reduction in the retirement benefits for persons retiring at age 62 which happens to be the majority of people entering the system The reason is we have the highest levels of unemployment in a half a century  the highest rates since 1940 and the largest numbers of persons out of work since then And that is your incomeThe outgo of the retirement system is not permanent its not fixed The income fluctuates and the income being dependent on employment is down very badly The point if I can take a quick second is I have been talking to you about the oldage insurance and oldage survivors insurance and disability insurance They have a shortterm problem more difficult than we had thought Theres a longterm problem thats right with us at this moment which is that of Medicare Medicare costs have been rising at 15 percent a year and we shall have to address that That cannot go on indefinitely Q Would you be in favor of a means test MOYNIHAN No I would not I would be in favor of much more strict requirements for hospitals about what they can charge MRS SULLIVAN It has been a very hot political potato for many many years and frankly most of the administrations were afraid to handle it because they felt that they would look as if they were trying to deprive the old people of something they worked all their lives for When President Reagan took office he realized that something would have to be done to save the system from bankruptcy I think that he was very courageous but at the same time he was doing something that was absolutely essential at the time I think it was very wise of him to appoint a bilateral commission to see what they could do about solving the problems And of course Senator Moynihan is a member of that commission And I have seen him at various times on television coming out after a meeting and decrying the Presidents moves and saying that the President was trying to scare the life out of senior citizens Frankly I think that Senator Moynihan was trying to scare the life out of senior citizens by making those remarks I know that there are certain things such as investments that have to be changed the way investments are made  and there should be actuarial policies followed that have not been followed that have succeeded in insurance business And after all this is insurance MOYNIHAN What are you talking about There are actuarial policies that will change what America This is not the Prudential Life Insurance Company This is the United States Government MRS SULLIVAN Well were talking about the Social Security system MOYNIHAN What are these actuarial changes you would make MRS SULLIVAN You see I am not on the commission right now I was just asked what are some of the things that might be done I have heard that actuarial policies should be followed MOYNIHAN What does that mean MRS SULLIVAN I followed that by saying I am not a member of the insurance industry Im just talking about different ideas that have been suggested in connection with the system  the method of investing the money for example the idea of eventually extending the age at which people retire to the age of 67 but doing it over a very long period I think perhaps that will one day be happening for this reason There are so many senior citizens the number of senior citizens is growing people are healthier and theyre living longer And I think that many people do not actually want to retire at a younger age anymore When that age of 65 was set the life expectancy was much below 76 or 78 which its at right now So these are just possibilities people are suggesting Q How about the means test MRS SULLIVAN Yes I oppose that Q Senator could you talk a little bit about what you think ought to be done about Social Security MOYNIHAN There is always the possibility of extending the interfund transfer which is a bookkeeping thing Its nothing serious There is the possibility of a very small transfer from general funds although we have to face the fact that you know you have a deficit and there are no general funds sitting around waiting to be used Q Arent you opening up a Pandoras box though if you go into general revenues to fund this MOYNIHAN If you insist on a repayment schedule there is general revenues in the system now Medicaid is part of the Social Security system Thats all paid for by general revenues Part of Medicare is in fact general revenues Federal Deficit Q How concerned are you about this massive Federal deficit and what can be done about it For instance would you favor the balancedbudget amendment MRS SULLIVAN Yes I do favor the balancedbudget amendment I think that we have to start addressing the problem now in light of the massive deficit that we have Q Do you think it could be balanced without major cuts in defense for example MRS SULLIVAN Yes I do I would not want to see any major cuts in defense I think that there is enough waste in the Government at every level including in the defense budget Q Senator what can be done about the deficits MOYNIHAN We are now spending 115 billion dollars in the coming 83 budget for a debt service Our just paying interest is 115 billion Its crowding out all other outlays But the debt is only about 2 12 years old If you got it back down to 5 and 6 percent you would cut that Q How MOYNIHAN By Federal Reserve policies of doing so thats how Thats what the Federal Reserve does If you bring down interest rates you bring down the cost of the debt The cost of the debt is called interest rates And secondly weve got to get us back down from doubledigit unemployment That is what is drying up revenues drying up GNP  steel running at 40 percent of capacity You see the real problem of this depression  and I will call it that  is that its not a business cycle movement in which things in the aftermath are pretty much like things beforehand Defense Spending Q Mrs Sullivan the Senator has said that he favors a 5 percent real increase every year for defense spending No 1 could you give us a figure of what kind of increase youre talking about for the Defense Department No 2 are there any defense projects that you would support and that you would not support because you think theyre too costly MRS SULLIVAN First of all the President when he took office was talking about playing catchup with the Soviets with respect to defense and he was suggesting that we should have a growth at the rate of 7 to 7 12 percent That is not what we have achieved We are up to I believe its 63 percent right now And I think that we cannot afford to cut anything from that defense budget Back in 1950 in nuclear arms we were 10to1 ahead of the Soviets In 1960 it was 2to1 in 1970 we were even Since 1970 the Soviets have continued to expand and to grow at the rate of 5 percent a year and they are now in the process of putting 12 to 14 percent of their GNP into military spending We have got to recognize the fact that we are responsible not only for our own safety which is of course No 1 but we also have defense agreements with more than 40 other nations They look to us to be strong An example of our lack of strength was in Afghanistan and in Poland And I think that the Soviets showed at that time that they knew that they were superior to us in weapons They are in fact superior in both types of weapons  nuclear and conventional Q Mrs Sullivan are you suggesting that if our country was militarily stronger than it is now we might have taken a different position toward Afghanistan or toward the troubles in Poland MRS SULLIVAN Im suggesting that those situations may never have occurred if we were stronger at that time I think that the Soviets realized that they were in a superior position and they took full advantage of it and of course now as in Libya when the Libyans attacked our fleet we shot down two of their planes and that was the end of that incident I think that we have started building up our credibility in the world again and we will have peace through strength But thats the only way well have it Q As long as were talking about defense do you want to tell us about the Senators 26 billion in the defense budget cuts MRS SULLIVAN All right That was under President Carter and there were  I dont have those various bills with me They added up to 26 billion I brought another one that was even bigger MOYNIHAN I ask Mrs Sullivan what 26 billion cut when what year Have you got it MRS SULLIVAN I havent got it MOYNIHAN Well you havent got it because it doesnt exist MRS SULLIVAN I can come up with various bills My mistake was that they added up to 26 billion It was more than one bill MOYNIHAN I wonder if I could ask Mrs Sullivan  and she doesnt have to answer  she said in 1960 the United States was 2to1 ahead of the Soviet Union in nuclear arms What do you mean by that MRS SULLIVAN In the number of nuclear weapons that we have produced and that we have  MOYNIHAN What is a nuclear weapon in your view MRS SULLIVAN Senator Moynihan lets not get technical about what the weapons are MOYNIHAN Lets not be technical MRS SULLIVAN Well a nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon MOYNIHAN You mean a rocket MRS SULLIVAN Ive never built one MOYNIHAN You mean a launching pad You mean a missile You mean a warhead MRS SULLIVAN I mean a nuclear weapon Any one of those MOYNIHAN You think a launching pad is a nuclear weapon MRS SULLIVAN No You are the one who mentioned that MOYNIHAN What do you mean by nuclear weapons What is a nuclear weapon MRS SULLIVAN Senator Moynihan if you want to get that technical I think we should have another debate on nuclear weapons and Ill have all the information about nuclear weapons MOYNIHAN Is it technical not to know what a nuclear weapon is as opposed to being a United States Senator MRS SULLIVAN Senator Moynihan on the night of the first debate talking about being unfair you made statements while we were on television that you had what you implied was inside information that you were in on with President Reagan that proved that what I was saying was wrong You in fact admitted later you had no inside information You implied to a general audience that I was misstating the preparedness of this country because you knew better through inside information And that was not true So I think that was very unfair of you MOYNIHAN You cannot define a nuclear weapon but you know that the United States is inferior to the Soviet Union in them when it was 2to1 in 1960 What I say was that the statement that the Soviet Union has nuclear superiority over the United States is false And is pernicious I said President Reagan said that last spring  last winter I publicly at that time so stated The structure of our forces is so different that to speak of one as superior and the other inferior when both are so huge is in my mind a mistake It is the worst possible message to send the Soviet Union that we think they are superior They are not Q Senator just to get that straight then you werent implying in that statement that you had inside information that wasnt available to anybody else MOYNIHAN No I was not Q Although it sounded that way MOYNIHAN Well it neednt have sounded that way School Prayer Q Were going to ask you about a series of domestic issues and wed appreciate it if you can keep it to a yes and no whether you favor each thing One is school prayer MRS SULLIVAN Yes I do MOYNIHAN I oppose stripping the Constitution of the Supreme Courts right to hear a case on the subject Abortion Q Medicaid financing of abortion centers MOYNIHAN I am in favor of that MRS SULLIVAN I am opposed Q The the antiabortion constitutional amendment MOYNIHAN Im against that MRS SULLIVAN Im for it Death Penalty Q Death penalty MRS SULLIVAN For it MOYNIHAN I am for it in very rare circumstances There is one crime which carries the death penalty in the United States code right now and that is committing a hijacking where death results I would have no objection to the death penalty for the crime of murdering the President or of treason during time of war Tuition Tax Credits Q Tuition tax credits Senator Id like you to address the idea that youve been proposing this for years and making political capital out of it but nothings happened MOYNIHAN I havent been overwhelmed by the political capital but a bill for the first time in history a bill supported by an Administration has been reported from the Senate Finance Committee and is on the Senate calendar Q Thats not going anyplace this year MOYNIHAN Well this year is running fast but that has happened and I claim it to be an event That never happened before MRS SULLIVAN It did take a long time to get there but yes I would support it definitely The Middle East Q On Israel and the Middle East lets narrow the question to your views on President Reagans proposal for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip And the Palestinian autonomy MOYNIHAN My reading was that it was not different from the Camp David agreements and that we have every reason to expect that the parties to that agreement will keep them I think there was a passage there with respect to the governance of Jerusalem which needs explaining and I think it can be explained But I stand by Camp David and the Egyptians and the Israelis are parties to that treaty MRS SULLIVAN I feel that President Carter took a very important first step with the Camp David accord and it is probably one of the most important things he did while he was in office And I think that President Reagans timing  especially at this point with the cessation we hope of hostilities in Lebanon  his timing in taking this very important second step which is in agreement with the Camp David accords was very good The point is that he made it clear to the rest of the world that we were going to take the initiative here that it was the time for people to sit down and negotiate on this and in fact it was excellent with respect to the meeting of the Arab nations in Fez Morocco Political Labels Q Senator youre running on the DemocraticLiberal line You have been identified for the last several years with various causes and people who have been labeled neoconservatives Id like to hear you label yourself MOYNIHAN I am a moderate Democrat within the tradition of John F Kennedy for whom I first went to Washington as assistant secretary of labor Q Youre not a neoconservative MOYNIHAN Now whats that Im a Democrat I voted first for Harry Truman And I stood in line with all the other kids and waved at Franklin D Roosevelt And I come from that neighborhood  not just the neighborhood but that people  where youre born a Democrat and youre baptized a Catholic Q Mrs Sullivan would you describe yourself too MRS SULLIVAN Yes but Id like to comment first  this is a quote from Senator Moynihan on Sept 29 1982 It was in The New York Times Six years ago on Election Night I said I ran as a liberal and was elected as a liberal I think I have behaved as one and voted as one and will go on doing so MOYNIHAN Well so was Harry Truman Whats the matter with that MRS SULLIVAN Well Im just saying you describe yourself as a moderate Democrat and  MOYNIHAN Well thats what Democrats are MRS SULLIVAN Liberals MOYNIHAN Thats right MRS SULLIVAN I am a conservative Republican I have always been a Republican Im very proud of the party Im proud of the government that we have now And I am for less government interference in our lives Im for lower taxes Im for a strong defense And I think that that sums it up
DANFORTH APPEARS TO LEAD IN MISSOURI SENATE CONTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/us/danforth-appears-to-lead-in-missouri-senate-contest.html,Despite an energetic challenger who calls on Democrats to rally to their party because of the economy Senator John C Danforth appears to hold a comfortable lead as he tries to retain a key Republican seat State Senator Harriett Woods Senator Danforths opponent campaigns tirelessly against the incumbents support of President Reagan But Mr Danforth is working just as hard He is outspending her by more than 2 to 1 with television advertisements supporting a warm image he enjoys among Missourians This is the only race in which Democrats are running a woman for the Senate a distinction that draws feminist interest and money from outside Missouri But it also is one of an important group of three Senate races where Republicans expected incumbents to be reelected on the basis of their personal qualities though representing normally Democratic states that have severe economic problems Looking for Upsets In Missouri as in Rhode Island with Senator John H Chafee and Minnesota with Senator David Durenberger Democrats acknowledge the popularity of the incumbents But they hope that vigorous opponents will achieve upsets by emphasis on the recession Party officials say that if a real Democratic tide is running it will show up in these states So far there is no evident tide in the show me state Mrs Woods who was endorsed today by The St Louis PostDispatch was an upset winner in the August primary She emphasizes her record as a state senator in supporting programs for the elderly She also cites the 101 percent unemployment rate for September as evidence the Administrations economic policies are not working At a breakfast in Bowling Green Saturday she told of encountering a hardworking onearmed farmer who faced foreclosure by the Farmers Home Administration Then she denounced the symbolism of a Government that will bail out the big banks on loans to Poland and Mexico but when it comes to our own working farmers says we have to be pretty selective Support for Danforth Called Tepid Pat Lea the Democratic state chairman argues that while no one dislikes Danforth there is no enthusiasm for him either For example Randy Snell a Clarksville schoolteacher questioned Mrs Woods after a parade Saturday and then told reporters Danforth is a good man honest hardworking But Mr Snell said he was leaning to Mrs Woods because of the economy and because she opposed antiabortion legislation Nevertheless there are just so many Missourians a candidate can reach by marching in parades Hoping to raise 500000 to spend on television as against 1000000 for the betterknown incumbent Mrs Woods is at a disadvantage in name recognition The Danforth commercials portray the incumbent effectively as a supporter of President Reagan but one who will sometimes vote his convictions regardless of the Presidents position Mrs Woodss far less visible advertising campaign replays the beginnings of his television commercials adds Thats what he says and quotes Mr Danforths voting record Incumbents Lead Substantial John R Powell the Republican state chairman said Mr Danforths lead was substantial but not yet safe in a state so Democratic that the Senators 1976 victory was the only Republican victory in the last 12 Senate contests He added that the lead would widen if Mr Danforth had exposed the record of his opponent whom Mr Powell called an extreme leftwing liberal person proabortion probusing proERA against the constitutional amendment to balance the budget Thus far Republican campaigners have not needed to use such arguments The only published poll conducted here by The St Louis GlobeDemocrat and KMOX a television station gave Mr Danforth a lead of 56 percent to 39 percent in a survey taken late in September He led by 23 percentage points among men but only by 10 among women Perhaps the greatest threat to Mr Danforths reelection is the impact of Fridays announcement of 101 percent unemployment It dominated television news here as elsewhere He said Obviously a Republican would rather not have 10 percent unemployment But he said Im not down in the dumps Everybody knows were in the soup The question is how we get out of the soup I dont see any enthusiasm for repeating past errors More than issues the difference in the campaigns is resources Mr Danforth expects to spend 2 million without investing any of his fortune from the RalstonPurina interests said Carrie Francke his campaign manager Jody Newman Mrs Woodss manager spoke of getting our message across by spending 750000 in the general election But other Democrats have said that this was unlikely to be enough One reason is that a television dollar does not go as far in Missouri as in other states of its size Much of the audience in the major television markets St Louis and Kansas City lives outside the state and cannot vote here
G.O.P. SEES OTTINGER-FOSSEL RACE AS A MAJOR TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/14/nyregion/gop-sees-ottinger-fossel-race-as-a-major-test.html,Representative Richard L Ottinger reflected the other day on the nice things that former President Gerald R Ford had recently said about Mr Ottingers Republican opponent Assemblyman Jon S Fossel Endorsements are good for raising money the 53yearold Democrat said in his district office here but they dont have anything to do with winning elections Mr Ottinger has represented Westchester County for 14 years and is accustomed to ranking Republicans coming in to help his opponents President Richard M Nixon did so in 1972 the year Mr Ottinger lost to Peter A Peyser a Democrat who was then a Republican Reapportionment has changed the lines of Mr Ottingers 24th Congressional District and relabeled it the 20th Extending from Mount Vernon north to Mount Kisco the new district now includes about 7100 more Republican and Conservative voters than it did in 1980 when Mr Ottinger defeated Dr Joseph W Christiana Identity Problem for Fossel Mr Fossel a 40yearold economist from Katonah represents an Assembly district in northern Westchester that extends south only as far as Ossining He must now campaign in southern parts of the county where many Republicans live but where he is a relative stranger His name recognition is already high Mr Fossel says of Mr Ottinger Hes got two things I cant possibly match One is the ability to send out newsletters free with franking privileges and a large staff he can use quite legitimately Mr Fossel is spending about 100000 on television advertising much more than was ever employed by an Ottinger foe Mr Ottinger has declined to buy television time The National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Committee have committed 55000 to the Fossel campaign the maximum allowed under Federal election law One of the Top Races Its one of the top races in the country no question about that said Joseph Gaylord the Congressional committees campaign director A top race Mr Gaylord said is one in which a particularly attractive Republican is pitted against a vulnerable Democrat Mr Gaylord said his committee had recommended that Mr Ford speak at a 100aplate breakfast for Mr Fossel earlier this month Mr Gaylord said Mr Ottinger was vulnerable because of Mr Fossels organization ability to motivate people and ability to generate funds Mr Fossel has Conservative Party backing as well as the Republican line on the Nov 2 ballot The breakfast raised about 25000 for Mr Fossels campaign treasury which is expected to total about 400000 Through the end of September Mr Fossel said he had raised about 300000 Mr Ottinger said that his budget would ultimately total about 250000 or double his 1980 expenditures with well over 15000 in hand now Dr Christiana acknowledged spending about 32000 in 1980 Ottinger Labeled Ultraliberal Republican strategy is aimed at picturing Mr Ottinger as an ultraliberal with a fiscal ideology that is as Mr Ford described it old tired and discredited Mr Ottinger in those days the former President said referring to his own Administration was a big spender and irresponsible I dont view myself as a liberal Democrat Mr Ottinger said in an interview But he added I vote very strongly on Constitutional rights  in favor of ERA and minority rights and thats what the ADA and others mark me on The Americans for Democratic Action a liberal political organization gave Mr Ottinger a 100 percent rating on his voting performance in Congress in 1981 Mr Fossel just supports Reagonomics Mr Ottinger said In his Harrison campaign office Mr Fossel asserted in an interview that Mr Ottinger had supported most of the increases in Federal spending and taxes He added I would have voted for the least rate increase in spending and taxes and therefore for the least Federal deficits He said that fiscally President Reagan is on the right track Agreement on Some Issues Later in one of the roughly 30 joint appearances the candidates are scheduled to make Mr Fossel described himself as conservative fiscally and tough on crime Yet he and Mr Ottinger agreed on some issues before 150 students and faculty members at the Westchester Community College in Valhalla One was abortion Asked whether either candidate favored a constitutional amendement banning elective abortions Mr Fossel said No I agree Mr Ottinger said They also agreed on opposition to any constitutional amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget It would wreck a recessionary economy to be frozen into that straitjacket Mr Ottinger said Youd have to keep cutting and cutting programs It wouldnt do the job Mr Fossel said The right way to balance a budget is to balance a budget
WORKING WOMEN CRITICAL OF REAGAN; G.O.P. FEARS IMPACT IN TIGHT RACES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/15/us/working-women-critical-of-reagan-gop-fears-impact-in-tight-races.html,Marilyn Stratmeyer is part of a profound change in American politics For the first 10 years of her marriage she stayed home in Lennox SD reared her three children and took her husbands advice about politics Now she is working as a waitress at the Longhorn Cafe and making her own voting decisions There are so many women who work now said Mrs Stratmeyer who is 40 years old They have their own money and that takes away a certain amount of the reliance they have had on men You have your choices now Political scientists have long argued that sex has no impact on voting behavior But in the 1970s women like Mrs Stratmeyer poured into the work force and by 1980 their new economic independence began to produce a political independence as well Postelection surveys showed that in 1980 President Reagan ran better among men than among women Since then public opinion polls have continued to reflect this difference in attitudes toward the President and a new term gender gap has entered the political language With the November elections less than a month away political analysts now believe that the gender gap could be a critical factor in many close races And even Republican officials concede that the animosity of women toward the President is now rubbing off on their candidates across the country Trend Worries Republicans Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee says that almost all Republican candidates for the Senate with the exception of Representative Millicent Fenwick in New Jersey are lagging among women The gender gap is widest among younger working women he says and the trend has the Senator worried If there is an unchangeable trend in this country it is the continuing escalation of women into the marketplace Mr Packwood said And if the current facts about young women in the marketplace hold Republicans are sitting on a time bomb This apparent shift in the political landscape has its origins out in the country in the personal and individual experiences of women like Mrs Stratmeyer While earning a paycheck gives these women a certain independence it can also produce a sense of insecurity Most women work because they need the money and now they say they are feeling firsthand the piercing vulnerability of rising unemployment rates Women realize the responsibility is on their shoulders observed Representative Olympia J Snowe Republican of Maine and they see how the President is setting them back The insensitivity in the White House is totally apparent It is apparent to Nancy Boucher a single parent of two children in Memphis who usually works two jobs to make ends meet Recently she took on a third job running a booth at the Tennessee state fair to earn some extra Christmas money Reagan Promises Doubted Every time Reagan makes a speech he says things will get better that the economy will turn around said Mrs Boucher But we never see that happening in our own lives Ann Aleck is head cashier at a discount store in Sioux Falls SD where she supervises many women who have entered the work force out of economic necessity Theyre out in the job market where they really dont want to be Mrs Aleck said That means that their kids are not taken care of at night and they feel terrible In their mind that is one of Reagans faults Even women who lack their own paychecks often manage the husbands and they feel the direct impact of inflation and high interest rates on the familys purchasing power Husbands dont buy the groceries said Mrs Boucher whose own husband walked out recently saying he did not want the responsibility of a family So they dont see the little price changes going up Since most poor people in America are women or their dependent children women suffer a disproportionate impact from President Reagans cuts in social programs For example 85 percent of the recipients of the minimum Social Security benefit which President Reagan wanted to eliminate are elderly women If women are not sick and infirm themselves they often take responsibility for relatives who are One of them is Helene Zangara a store clerk in Daytona Beach Fla who watches in pain as her inlaws scrape by on Social Security checks You see one of them pick up a box of strawberries in the market she said and the other one says to put it back They cant afford it Sex Discrimination Resented As women spread through the marketplace they also become more aware of discrimination based on sex and more resentful of what they feel is the failure of the Reagan Administration to eradicate that prejudice Elaine Brazell the wife of a retired civil servant in Florida cites several complaints her motherinlaws bank account was frozen after she became a widow and her daughters lost their seniority at work after they took maternity leave Reagan is committed to the church groups the fundamentalists Mrs Brazell said and they campaigned on no equal rights for women Reagan has been against abortion and equal rights added Vicki Chism a bank teller in Daytona Beach But women feel that should be their own decision In 1980 many analysts believed that Mr Reagans poorer showing among women was based on the war and peace issue the fear that his aggressive foreign policy could lead to war That issue appears to have paled in the face of economic concerns but it still bothers women like Iris Simpson an admninistrative assistant at the National Cotton Council in Memphis All this talk about the draft she said I have two boys and Im not in favor of that For some women hostility toward Mr Reagan and the Republicans is a matter of style Lee Ann Carnes a beautician in Lennox SD derides Nancy Reagan as a big spender and Joan Carter an assistant in a Florida law office says the President comes across to some women as a male chauvinist But many women say that their political attitudes are shaped by the oldest of female attributes Call it intuition said Kris Gilley a waitress in Sioux Falls but I think someone is always pulling Reagans strings
CONNECTICUT INCUMBENTS TOP SPENDERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/16/nyregion/connecticut-incumbents-top-spenders.html,The incumbents in the Connecticut statewide races this fall United States Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr and Gov William A ONeill are heavily outspending their opponents according to campaign finance reports filed yesterday and today with the Secretary of the State Senator Weicker a Republican spent more than 14 million in his quest for a third term from the day his campaign began through Sept 30 compared with spending of 11 million by his Democratic opponent Representative Toby Moffett Some of Mr Weickers funds however were spent campaigning against Prescott S Bush Jr the brother of Vice President Bush in the Republican primary The Weicker campaign put spending before the general election campaign at slightly more than 1 million A third entry in the Senate race Lucien P DiFazio the Conservative Party candidate filed an incomplete report indicating that he had raised 25600 between July 1 and the end of September and had spent 23143 The report did not say where the money had come from or how it was spent Mr DiFazio said when he began his campaign that he expected 250000 to 300000 in campaign contributions by midSeptember with the help of the National Conservative Political Action Committee In the gubernatorial race Mr ONeill a Democrat has raised about 800000 compared with 723000 for Lewis B Rome his Republican challenger since their campaigns began But much of Mr Romes funds were spent winning his partys nomination in a fourway race Mr ONeill faced little serious opposition for the nomination Labor and Business Aid Weicker The campaign reports showed that Mr Weicker received substantial amounts from the political action committees of labor unions trade organizations and manufacturers Among the large donors were the political action committees of the United Food  Commercial Workers 5000 the National Association of Home Builders 4000 the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks 2500 the Air Line Pilots Association 5000 United Technologies 6000 General Dynamics 1500 Colt Industries 1000 Stanley Works 1000 the Grumman Corporation 500 the National Abortion Rights Action League 6750 and the National Association of Broadcasters 1000 Individual donors to the Weicker campaign included Harry J Gray chairman of the board of United Technologies which is based in Hartford and the chairmen of the board or chief executive officers of Mobil Heublein Lord  Taylors the Southern New England Telephone Co and Caldor Inc Charles A Muessel treasurer of the Weicker campaign said his candidate would raise and spend 18 million by Election Day Donors to Mr Moffett included the Americans for Democratic Action 2000 the American Federation of Teachers 9500 the International Ladies Garment Workers Union 5000 the League of Conservation Voters 4100 and the Sierra Club 2000 Mondale Donation for Moffett Individual donors included former Vice President Walter F Mondale Arthur Miller the playwright Milos Forman the film director Mason Adams the actor former Representative Robert N Giaimo Stephen Stills the musician and Andy Warhol the artist Governor ONeills report showed donations from most of his commissioners as well as from former Senator Abraham A Ribicoff Alfred Van Sinderen chief operating officer of the Southern New England Telephone Company gave 2125 to Mr ONeill and 1250 to Mr Rome
LEGISLATURE'S TROOPS TURNING TO THE JOB OF WINNING ELECTONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/nyregion/legislature-s-troops-turning-to-the-job-of-winning-electons.html,Like generals of opposing armies the leaders of the New York State Legislature are deploying their forces and mapping lastminute campaigns to control the Legislatures 206th session Through much of the year they do battle over legislation on issues like taxes local aid the death penalty abortion and crime But with Election Day approaching much of the apparatus of the Legislature is turned to getting candidates elected Politics is the machine by which government operates said Kent Sanders director of the Senate Republican campaign committee and an assistant to the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton This is the political season Though all 211 seats of the new Legislature will be on ballots around the state each party in the Senate and Assembly is focusing on a small number of close races in what are considered marginal districts those that can change hands with a little extra effort They send money pollsters political technicians and manpower to key battlegrounds where they can do the most good County Units Almost Bypassed This type of support by a partys central operation as Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Democrat of Brooklyn calls it has in the last decade become a key factor in some close races It has all but replaced the once allimportant party county committees in some parts of the state In special elections the Assembly Democrats have been particularly skilled in bringing in dozens of campaign workers at the last minute In the Assembly the Democrats who have been in control since 1974 and who dictated the newly reapportioned district lines are hoping to increase their 88seat majority while the Republicans are simply trying to reduce the damage created by reapportionment There are 27 seats with no incumbents running and in three races incumbent Democrats and Republican are running against each other We are going to play a little defense said Assemblyman Clarence D Rappleyea Jr Republican of Norwich chairman of the Assembly Republican Campaign Committee In the Senate where a 61st seat was added by reapportionment the Democrats are hoping that national economic problems and a strong showing by the DemocraticLiberal candidate for Governor Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo will help them pick up one or two seats But 59 of 60 incumbents are running and the Republicans say they are confident of at least maintaining their 35seat majority Campaign Chest of 24 Million The basic weapons are the campaign committees of each party in each house and the money they raise throughout the year By Election Day all four committees expect to spend a total as high as 24 million The money comes from business interests and labor unions with a continuing interest in legislation in Albany Much of it is contributed without regard to party labels or ideology mostly to the parties in power in each house As Election Day approaches much of the regular legislative apparatus is mobilized as well Researchers and members of staffs compile records of accomplishments position papers arguments against the other side  the fodder of a political campaign Political aides kept on the legislative payroll throughout the year work with new candidates helping them develop campaign themes figuring out their messages and how to get them across to voters Some legislative employees go out to key districts across the state Others work as volunteers after working hours Night after night Democratic legislative employees fill the office of the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee working telephones and putting together mailings used in Assembly races In the Assembly Anthony Genovesi executive director of the Commission on Efficiency and Economy in Government and a key political operative travels throughout the state organizing field staffs targeting voter groups designing leaflets advising candidates on what to say and what not to say His political wizardry is admired by Democrats and Republicans alike On Leave to Campaign Since early September half of Mr Genovesis salary has been paid by the campaign committee Most legislative employees involved in campaigns say they are on leave or taking time owed But some say privately that few records are kept Asked about possible campaign abuses in the Legislature Marvin Nailor a spokesman for State Comptroller Edward V Regan said that the Legislature is a separate branch of government and was not subjected to routine audits The Legislature is in effect audited every two years at the voting booths he said The Legislature determines its own payrolls who gets paid what It determines its own leave policy its own time and attendance policy In Suffolk County William Gelfond a newly hired legislative employee on the Senate Democratic payroll is working on the campaign of Patrick R Vecchio against the Republican incumbent Senator James R Lack Joseph Polser a spokesman for the Senate Democrats said Mr Gelfond was technically on leave He added that the Senate Democrats kept a professional pollster Steve Appell on the legislative payroll as a program analyst The Senate minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein Democrat of Manhattan said that political aides all had regular substantive jobs but put in whatever extra time is necessary in order to help elect our members Both Legislators and Politicians Political work is part of the job he added We are legislators and we are politicians and that is the nature of the process There is no delineation involved There is a totality of responsibility people willingly undertake Mr Sanders of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee said that with the luxury of incumbency Republicans in the Senate dont need a bunch of people in a caravan going around the state away from their legislative jobs But he said one of his assistants was spending time on races in Rochester and Suffolk County while an aide to Senator L Paul Kehoe Republican of upstate Lyons in Wayne County was helping out in a race in a new district nearby The party leaders and their campaign committees have grown in importance over the years as the influence of the traditional political organizations particularly the county organizations declined in most parts of the state It used to be that the county committee would find candidates organize their campaign help with money and deliver the vote on Election Day Now the leaders have taken over much of the job of keeping their members in office and courting candidates to run against the oppositions incumbents This has occasionally caused friction with state Republican leaders complaining that their counterparts in the Legislature were competing for campaign donations while ignoring the rest of the ticket As Election Day draws near the campaign committees can shift money and manpower to the closest races for example spending thousands of dollars on television and radio in a single district But Mr Fink said that regardless of strategy and manpower there is no substitute for a candidate of good quality and character
YALE ENCOURAGING SCREENING TESTS TO FIND BIRTH DEFECTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/nyregion/yale-encouraging-screening-tests-to-find-birth-defects.html,A GENETIC screening test is available to pregnant women in Connecticut that can help determine whether they are carrying a fetus with a neural tube spine or brain defect The test is being performed at the Yale University School of Medicine and kits for it may soon become available to laboratories throughout the nation But because of the controversial nature of the test  some women carrying a fetus with a spine or brain defect will chose abortion  members of the Department of the Human Genetics at Yale say they are opposed to unregulated nationwide distribution Their concern is that without tight regulation the testing may increase anxiety among pregnant women and possibly result in their choosing abortions before the full scale of testing is completed raising the possibility of aborting a healthy fetus The concern about the tests comes at a time of debate within the scientific community about genetic testing in general Last week a Congressional subcommittee began hearing testimony on the advisability  and dangers  of genetic screening of workers to try to determine whether they are genetically predisposed to ailments that might be caused by exposure to certain substances in the workplace After first deciding in 1979 that kits for the AFP for alphafeto protein test for pregnant women be made available to any medical laboratory in the country the Federal Food and Drug Administration pulled back after some groups protested The groups which included the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology the Ralph Nader Health Research Group and the National Spina Bifida Association of America said they opposed the unrestricted regulation of the laboratories and of primary care physicians who would be performing the tests The FDA is currently reassessing its position on the testing kits The Federal agencys approval is needed before pharmaceutical concerns can market the kits on a nationwide basis Through the AFP test a physician can determine preliminary information about the health of the fetusthrough a simple blood test performed when women are approximately four months pregnant Alphafeto protein is a simple protein synthesized by the yolk sac If there is an incomplete closure of the spine as in spina bifida or an incomplete closure of the skull with incomplete brain development anencephaly AFP will leak into the amniotic fluid and raise the mothers blood serum level An elevated blood serum level indicated in an AFP test does not necessarily mean a woman is carrying a child with a neural tube defect however It may mean that she is carrying twins or is further along in her pregnancy than she thought Approximately five in every 100 women who have the test will show an elevated AFP level A second test is then required For most women the second test will be normal negative and no further testing will be required But three of every 100 women will require further testing The next procedure is ultrasound a technique in which high frequency sound waves directed into the uterus produce a picture of the fetus on a screen This test often shows a normal fetus or may indicate the need for amniocentesis  a procedure in which the fluid surrounding the fetus is drawn from the uterus and analyzed Only one in 15 women who have the test will be shown to be carrying a fetus with a neural tube defect which affects some 5000 babies born in the United States each year One of the problems with the test its critics says is that it takes several weeks for results to be definitive women who are told in the initial stages of the test that they may be carrying a fetus with a serious defect may become anxious and opt for an abortion rather than wait for the full test to be performed According to Dr Maurice J Mahoney medical director of the AFP program at Yale although there is a 92 percent chance that at the amniocentesis stage of testing a pregnant woman is carrying a normal fetus for those few women in the highrisk category timing and efficiency are critical factors This requires expertise at the laboratory level and in counseling Medical professionals believe that unregulated laboratories will not be equipped to handle the volume of the blood specimens quickly or efficiently enough Even with that tiny percentage of women we want to make zero errors in the diagnosis Dr Mahoney said Many women who find after all the testing is complete that they are carrying a child with a serious health problem will decide to terminate the pregnancy Thus absolute certainty about the information given them is necessary Dr Mahoney said He noted however that AFP was not a perfect test At the moment he said it is a test that can help women carrying a fetus with a serious birth defect to decide about the childs future A small percentage of women decides to go ahead and have the child he said and have a surgical team operate at birth on the child in the hope of alleviating some of the physical complications The program at Yale was set up by James PT Harisiades the statewide AFP coordinator and it is one of the first such programs in the nation It is our philosophy said Mr Harisiades that parents are given every bit of information necessary regarding the possibility of having a child with a birth defect Because of the ethical and moral concerns it is important that parents of the child be actively involved in a decisionmaking process At Yale Dr Mahoney and Mr Harisiades oversee the laboratory operations Thousands of blood samples from around the state are sent to Yale for analysis There are about a six centers in the United States with coordinated programs similar to that at Yale In terms of actual testing said Mr Harisiades Yale works with physicians throughout the state and encourages women to have the blood test and ultrasound if necessary at the local level he said Those needing sophisticated equipment and diagnostic expertise are referred to Yale or UConn which also has diagnostic equipment About 25 percent of the pregnant women in southern Connecticut are taking advantage of AFP testing center officials said Some womens groups and physicians oppose AFP testing in general Dr Ronald Rozette medical director of the Community Health Care Plan in New Haven said the last time I looked at the data there were still enough false positives women identified at the initial screening stages as possibly having a child with a genetic defect who actually did not to make me concerned about widescale distribution In a survey in Britain of 228 women interviewed 97 percent favored national AFP screening In a survey at Yale of 53 women questioned 60 percent said AFP testing should be routine during pregnancy Godfrey Oakley chief of the birth defects branch at the Center for Environmental Health in Washington has said It is clear that these AFP testing kits can work Theyre being used responsibly through centers in this nation such as Yale with experienced coordinators There are many professionals who feel that women should have access to these kits nationwide The question is how do you get responsible access
PEDIATRICS NOW RANGES FROM BABIES TO TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/nyregion/pediatrics-now-ranges-from-babies-to-teenagers.html,COLIC and middleear infections still occupy the pediatrician but this primarycare specialists practice now often involves such matters as teenage pregnancy birth control peer pressure smoking and drugs Why Because according to many pediatricians this specialty has taken upon itself the vast responsibility of improving health care for adolescents Were not throwing away the otoscope said Dr John Partin chairman of the department of pediatrics of the State University at Stony Brook referring to the device primarily used to check the middle ear of infants and young children Were just adding contraceptives His remark sums up the trend that has been taking place in pediatrics on Long Island and nationally in the last decade Dr Partin graduated from medical school in 1958 with an orientation toward babies Twentyodd years later his waiting room is filled with young adults wanting gynecological examinations and birth control and information on growing up Ten years ago adolescents were known as medical orphans having been shuffled around from general practictioner to internist to pediatrician according to Dr Partin Because the number of infants has decreased and many of the problems associated with infant and child health are under control he said we have expanded our practice to include this segment of the population Do teenagers like their new home among rag dolls and lollipops Dr Partin said Its my experience that teenagers do not like to be in a setting that stigmatizes them as being less mature than they are He added that if adolescents were treated as maturing young individuals they could be somewhat forgiving of the environment Now that the baby boom generation has grown up 30 to 40 percent of Long Island pediatricians are making significant efforts to attract teenagers according to I Ronald Shenker chief of adolescent medicine at the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center Pediatricians are offering different hours or days and some have separate waiting rooms Long Island is reflective of the general trend of pediatricians who are treating young adults into their early 20s Dr Shenker said Chapter 2 District 2 of the American Academy of Pediatrics which represents Brooklyn Queens Nassau and Suffolk has counted 797 pediatricians in the area The academy has about 22000 members throughout the United States The Board of Pediatrics located at Duke University in North Carolina has put more emphasis on comprehensive care for the adolescent and behavior issues in pediatric practice According to a 1980 article in the Journal of Adolescent Health Care there are 40 million Americans between the ages of 10 and 21 many of whom have no continuing access to health care Long Island officials agree The Suffolk County 1982 Youth Services Planning Agreement stated that children and youth are frequently ignored by health planning bodies It went further to document the acute need for adolescent services in Suffolk One objective of the program is to develop a base of information on health problems of the group in cooperation with the Suffolk County Department of Health Services NassauSuffolk Health Systems Agency State University of New York at Stony Brook and other health organizations Dr Partin was selftaught in adolescent medicine He recalled a 14yearold patient with severe abdominal pains She had been seen by a number of specialists yet no diagnosis could be made After three visits Dr Partin also found nothing wrong I turned to my patient and asked her to make three wishes he said On her third wish she asked that a friend of hers get well Then she started crying and we discovered together why she was having these severe pains The friend was her twin sister who had become pregnant Psychosomatic illness is not a stranger to adolescents who are struggling to establish themselves as a separate entity from their family Dr Partin added Rapport and trust are essential in communicating with teenagers Pediatricians practice grows more complex as adolescents become pregnant and have children We can actually treat the mother and her child in some cases Dr Partin said In 1980 Suffolk County ranked second in the state in the number of teenage pregnancies New York City ranked first These figures according to 1981 vital statistics from the New York State Department of Health include 1217 live births to teenagers and 1530 abortions Being an adolescent mother is a potentially stressful event which faces 600000 American teenagers yearly said Dr Shenker who is also associate professor of pediatrics at Stony Brook We must be advocates to our teenagers he said adding that routine health examinations allow for early detection and treatment of medical problems and counseling on birth control and drug abuse In spending more time with adolescents we were forced to adapt to several developmental stages Dr Shenker said Medical schools he said are now spending time on subjects linked with adolescence including menstruation rebellion drug abuse and counseling on longrange goals It could be said that pediatric medicine is in its adolescence and that adolescent medicine a subspecialty of pediatrics is in its infancy At the turn of the century Dr Partin said there were no pediatricians Those who took care of babies were generally obstetricians internists or general practictioners In 1933 the American Academy of Pediatrics was formed This group went on to stake out a turf in medicine Dr Partin said A task force on pediatric education formed in 1976 sent a questionnaire to 7087 pediatricians nationwide They all had graduated after 1961 Based on 3781 responses returned the task force found that about 66 percent of the doctors felt that their residency training was insufficient in adolescent medicine On the Island the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center the Nassau County Medical Center and the North Shore University Hospital have programs in adolescent medicine Stony Brook hopes to set up one in the near future We will always need pediatricians who specialize in the newborn Dr Partin said On the other end adolescent health care is going to play an increasing part of pediatric practice We are practicing on the new frontier
VOICES FROM THE POST-FEMINIST GENERATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/magazine/voices-from-the-post-feminist-generation.html,For more than a year a friend from work had been urging me to fix him up with a date My problem or it seemed to me his problem  was that his ideal woman sounded like a beautiful Boy Scout Finally I complained that his unrealistic expectations were sexist to boot He laughed Im not denying that You find me a woman whos not a feminist and well all be happy My friends much flaunted conservative politics were about to let me off an uncomfortable matchmaking hook I dont know any women who arent feminists I said He was still laughing Wrong You think that this is an issue of conservative versus liberal but its not If youd just look around youd see that youre a throwback Why would any woman today label herself a feminist I have yet to set up a date for my colleague and I probably never will I dont like the way he talks about women and all of my closest female friends  primarily women in their 30s  are feminists But his comment has stayed with me Are we nothing but the anomalies of a radical decade In 1972 the year I graduated from Cornell University Congress proposed the equal rights amendment Ms magazine published its first issue the Boston Marathon accepted women and the National Organization for Women was six years old I assumed that sexual equality would never again be perceived as undesirable Recently I began to suspect that I had been wrong The defeat of the equal rights amendment could be the work of male legislators representing corporate interests and a handful of women with good press agents Diminished social services which affect women most directly restrictive abortion laws cutbacks in affirmativeaction programs and proposed changes to the Federal civil rights guidelines concerning sexual harassment might be blamed on a generally more conservative political atmosphere But I wondered could a substantial proportion of the active participants in this retreat from the liberal advances of the 1970s actually be women Could my friend be right During the last 10 years I have seen my own feminism change Im not as angry as I used to be and my activism has become more of the moneygiving letterwriting sort But I have remained deeply committed to the principles of feminism and have continued to speak out in favor of the equal rights amendment access to safe and legal health care and abortion for all women economic equality Government and industrysupported day care What I wanted to find out was whether women 10 years younger than I worried about the same issues I decided to travel back to those places that had molded my political and social consciousness that had made me believe in the absolute importance of economic and sexual equality for women I became a feminist because I didnt think that women had the same opportunities and options as men Now I wanted to learn if women in my hometown and at my university women just out of college or new to the work force thought the situation had changed Were they even aware of the inequities that had existed between men and women as recently as the early 70s Statistics on the attitudes of 18 to 25yearolds toward feminism are almost nonexistent so my survey was decidedly informal unscientific and subjective But it turned out to be a personal odyssey that profoundly altered my attitudes toward this generation of women and even more toward my own feminism For it proved to me that my colleague should have no trouble finding at least among this age group a talented funny ambitious and if it didnt matter to him liberal woman who is not a feminist What has happened Where have I been hiding Actually Ive been living in New York City 10 years this past August I came here via Cornell from Sharon Pa an industrial city of everdecreasing population on the PennsylvaniaOhio border My plan was to stay in New York long enough to recover from an acute attack of careerism Then I would marry my college boyfriend look for some sort of work in his hometown of Allentown Pa and have kids probably three I was 22 and a feminist I came to feminism the way so many others did in the 1960s  through books I discovered Virginia Woolf and rediscovered Jane Austen I cried over Sylvia Plath I read The Second Sex The Group The Feminine Mystique And I made the decision to learn to take women as seriously as I had always taken men  a difficult task considering the years of training that conspired to make me think that men were more crucial to my sense of wellbeing than women What was hardest was learning to take myself seriously particularly as an equal participant in my relations with men My socialization had been very effective and the example set by my traditional parents a happy one I began slowly  by questioning not only the absence of a womens studies program at Cornell but also the importance I placed on what men said the fairness of traditional domestic roles even who paid for dates Working abetted by the compulsive watching of The Mary Tyler Moore Show put a practical underpinning to the theoretical ideas about feminism I had gulped down whole in college I knew I was right to tell my boss that no I wouldnt measure his inseam for a new pair of mailorder khakis but I still got teary standing up to a man who controlled my future and my paycheck I took courage every time Mary told Mr Grant through familiarly quivering lips that she wasnt being treated quite fairly Within a few months of starting my first job I decided  just as Mary did  that a fiance wasnt everything I acknowledged my own ambition Some of the romance has gone out of work I learned through hard experience to speak out against sexual harassment I realized that women in management even in publishing traditionally a womans field  were oddities or more frequently in the late 70s tokens I saw women lose professional stature and sometimes jobs when they took maternity leaves But in time as I became more successful I also became complacent and the feminist lessons that I learned from working the value of independence and a strong sense of self  became part of my unconscious They were like breathing I could not survive without them And I could never again think of myself as anything but a feminist I did not know that younger women could I did not know that feminism had become a dirty word I dont label myself a feminist Not for me but for the guy next door that would mean that Im a lesbian and that I hate men Its very hard to get heard if you assume a label thats going to turn people off to you And while it should not of course I am afraid that the lesbian connotation would affect my credibility with many of the people I want to reach Diana Shaw the 24yearold coauthor of a forthcoming book on decision making for adolescent girls spoke with assurance Think of the ERA situation she suggested You had a distinct issue there but the feminists brought along all these riders with it The one that did them the most harm was lesbian rights I decided that it wasnt appropriate for me to tell Miss Shaw that nowhere in the equal rights amendments 24 words was there any mention of lesbianism Besides the majority of women to whom I spoke reported that lesbian women were among the most committed feminists they knew As a consequence feminism had come to be strongly identified with lesbianism asked Jessica Jackson a black 24yearold account executive at a New York computerservice company why women seemed afraid to be incorrectly identified as lesbian Miss Jackson who is a feminist suggested that womens own anxieties about their sexuality might explain what sounded to me like homophobia At Mt Holyoke she told me the schism between lesbians and nonlesbians cut through the political fiber Coming to the Womens Center or to feminist events on campus meant communicating with a very solid lesbian community When you were 18 or 19 and real unsure of your sexuality the maturity to deal with that situation was just not there Whatever its cause the resistance to putting a label on their beliefs was real even for some women who might otherwise consider themselves feminists I was sympathetic at first I didnt need to be reminded of the discriminatory isolating and occasionally dangerous ramifications of labeling But as I thought about it I felt more and more strongly that one cant expect to reap the advantages of a social movement without announcing ones membership in it Sometimes accepting a label is a responsibility When my freshman roommate at Cornell found out I was Jewish she was at her request moved to a different room She told me she didnt think she had ever seen a Jew before My only response was to begin wearing a small Star of David on a chain around my neck I had not become a more observing Jew rather discovering that the label of Jew was offensive to others made me want to let people know who I was and what I believed in Similarly after talking to these young women  one of whom told me that she didnt think that she had ever met a feminist  Ive taken to identifying myself as a feminist in the most unlikely of situations The National Organization for Women prefers a different tactic People dont even like the word discrimination  Eleanor Smeal the outgoing president of NOW told me One of the reasons is that they dont want you to think that they have a bellyache that they are not OK And the word feminist is still considered a militant word The best way of dealing with all these things is not to use catchwords Talk about actual situations I disagreed with Mrs Smeals method but her explanation that a lot ob women are feminist in everything but name made some sense given the lack of consensus about what feminism means To some women feminism is a radical theory of separatism a special identification with women or those things that are distinctly feminine Most however agree with me Feminism means believing in equal rights Julie Rothman a 1982 graduate of the University of Vermont defined it in this straightforward way For most people feminism means having a strong sense of yourself as an individual independent female I was taken aback when she told me equally directly that she does not consider herself a feminist I give up too much of myself for the man I love she explained Like many other nonfeminists Miss Rothman who wouldnt let her older sister a social historian and a feminist into the room while we were talking  sympathizes with feminists I feel badly for them she said Its all right to be independent and strong but a lot of those women are alone Theyve set these goals for the ideal male a male theyve fabricated in their minds Defensiveness tinged her voice I do feel gratitude toward these women in terms of the actual political changes that have taken place Im just sorry that so few had to fight so hard to get what they got for so many Women who disavowed a connection with feminism while praising its political effects often sounded defensive when answering my questions but no one felt as put upon as I did I found myself wanting to show these young women my boyfriend Perhaps I thought they would like to come to a party and meet my friends I even had a nightmare in which a male doctor told me I had a terminal disease Your brain is not like a mans Early training dies hard and my unconscious was getting worked over But my discomfort peaked while talking to Rachel Flick the 23yearold assistant managing editor of The Public Interest magazine Since she is professionally associated with neoconservatism I remained unruffled when Miss Flick told me that though she continued to be grateful for the progress that feminists made in the last 10 years she had stopped associating herself with feminism about two years ago She now considers it an exclusively radical separatist bitter movement I was startled however to learn that her mother who had gone to law school after raising three daughters was the head of the task force on battered women at the San Diego chapter of the National Organization for Women My feelings about feminism are at least partially a reaction to my mother she explained Betty Friedan is right theyre losing the second generation because of this incredible bitterness She went on My abandonment of feminism was a process of intellect It was also a process of observation Look around and youll see some happy women and then youll see these bitter bitter women The unhappy women are all feminists Youll find very few happy enthusiastic relaxed people who are ardent supporters of feminism Feminists are really tortured people I was tempted to do something enthusiastically but I decided to relax I had after all heard fugues developed on the same theme by other women Miss Flick continued The reason I dont support feminism is that it simply does not speak my language Its a matter of style of attitude Im a lot less shrill since Im not a feminist The level of Angst in my life was just so futile I looked at myself after a while and said Oh shut up  When she walked out the door I felt suspended above a generation gap Neither of us could believe that the other was happy I was tempted to chalk off Rachel Flick as a conservative setup I had perpetrated on myself but I couldnt Perhaps I had been wrong not to admit more openly that being a feminist can make one occasionally angry frequently tired and often bored What worried me most however was a sense that we feminists who came of consciousness in the late 1960s and early 70s had ourselves been boring with our stories of how bad it was Instead of conveying our enthusiasms perhaps we had sunk into the trap of setting ourselves apart as gurus of liberation Donna Cooper told me that when she was at Cornell she was a Suzy Cheerleader Now at 23 she is the program director of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom a pacifist group founded in 1915 Some members want to take women out of the name she told me Miss Cooper has been an active feminist since 1979 She credits the June 12 rally for a nuclear freeze for allowing her to acknowledge openly that violence is a macho reaction The main reason I didnt  and dont  feel connected to the feminists who became active 10 or 15 years ago she explained is that I dont know if the older NOW women and the Ms women are willing to accept me Ive gotten the vibes from a lot of them that they think younger women arent professional I can sit in a meeting and act totally nonthreatening Older women cant probably because they were the first to open the doors But feminists should try to be more  warm The rejection of feminism has a long history in the United States Every period of advancement has been followed by one of retrenchment  at the beginning of the 20th century after women gained entrance into the professions particularly medicine during the 1920s after the ratification of the 19th Amendment after World War II and the successful integration of women into the workplace Nancy Cott associate professor of history and American studies and head of the womens studies program at Yale prefers to think of the years of retrenchment as moments of quiet after times of enthusiasm We should be emphasizing the periods of reform she suggested Id like to share her optimism but the 1980s are different This time the two traditionally prized female occupations  reproduction and homemaking  are no longer economically valued As numerous studies prove working is not a luxury it is a fact of life for most women They know that raising the small families that Americans now have is not a fulltime lifelong job  nor economically can it be And yet I heard feminists described not as women who were helping other women to achieve economic equality but as icy monsters as women who had let themselves go physically who had no sense of style Who had done this amazing publicrelations job Was I seeing actual differences between todays young women and those who addressed feminist issues 10 years ago or merely a reflection of the conservative mood of the larger community Marian Briffa a prelaw student at Fordham University and an active member of New Yorks Republican Law Students Association speaks at the age of 20 with the voice of the establishment I think that feminists are running a political course against every issue I believe in she told me Im not for Federal funds for abortion Im not for affirmative action Sure theres discrimination out there but you just cant sit there feeling sorry for yourself Its the individual womans responsibility to prove her worth Then she can demand equal pay Individualism is a hallmark of conservatism but women much more liberal than Miss Briffa told me that women should make it totally on their own For the first time I felt a backlash against the philosophical core of feminism  equality of economic opportunity  rather than its symbolic paraphernalia I would have found the lack of ideological cant refreshing even encouraging if most of these younger women hadnt by their own account been the victims of either sexual harassment or economic discrimination Not one woman I spoke to believes that women receive equal pay for equal or comparable work but it does not occur to most of them to use the power of the feminist movement to improve their position For Carol McFeeley a 25yearold sales assistant in a New York brokerage firm and a closet feminist success is crucial But her ambition dictates that she keep her mouth shut When I first started this job she remembered someone told a sexist joke and then he said Youre not a libber are you I said No Im not a libber and then I wanted to kill myself Reality can be intimidating Alexandra MacDonald a pseudonym requested for professional reasons a 24yearold reporter for a trade magazine decided to look for another job rather than speak up against what she saw as a clearcut case of sex discrimination against her on her last job even though she belonged to a union through which she could have filed a grievance I guess its a way of copping out she said of saying that Im not going to fight this thing The time is not right One thing that women can learn from men is to be more pragmatic Incidentally Mrs MacDonalds decision to adopt her husbands name even though as a writer she depends on an identifiable byline was not unusual In a perhaps trivial but startling change from women 10 years their senior most of these younger women expect to change their names when they marry Like so many of the women I spoke to Mrs MacDonald exhibited professional assertiveness and selfconfidence while maintaining fairly conventional attitudes about who bears the primary responsibility for child care As she said I was the daughter of a feminist but all of her activism only led her out of the house more When I came home from school my mother was working I resented it This is a fathers responsibility too but if fathers are not going to be responsible I think that mothers have to organize to get day care For herself however Mrs MacDonald hopes that by the time she and her husband decide to have children one of them will have a fulltime job and the other one will be working freelance or parttime An expectation of job flexibility for them and their husbands was remarked upon by most of the women In fact if men with high financial expectations and flexible jobs were traded on the stock exchange Id invest in futures Jennifer Moses a 23yearold who works as an assistant to the features editor of a major womens magazine shared my perception that todays young women seem extraordinarily sure they can have it all without even speaking up about unfairness at work I suspect that of my graduating class of 1400 from Tufts she explained only a handful went on to nonprofessional graduate school About half it seemed went to professional schools The rest went to good jobs  mostly at banks and such  with high salaries When you get out of school and immediately get a highpaying job why shouldnt you think you can have it all As for me Miss Moses continued if things keep going as they are and if Im lucky Id like to establish a career first and then get married and have kids since Id expect to take off 10 years or so when my children were young But you know she reflected if youre 22 or 23 and think that you dont have a choice theres something wrong with you Indeed it would be sad if the majority of 20yearolds were pessimists my generation  how quickly generations come these days  certainly thought we could have it all The difference is one of tone This groups naivete strikes me  subjectively as unidealistic our expectations were ridiculous but we spoke up for what we believed in And though almost all of my women friends see more contradictions in their lives than they like to admit admit them they do In a recent and certainly more objective survey conducted for Mademoiselle magazine of 10000 women between the ages of 17 and 30 87 percent of whom were 25 or younger Carol Tavris a social psychologist discovered that only 2 percent of the sample did not expect to work at all Furthermore Dr Tavris reported Half plan to earn over 25000 at the peak of their careers a salary earned by only 2 percent of working women Consider that 60 percent of the sample plan to stay home with their children for anywhere from two to six years Do they expect their jobs  or their employers  to wait for them And as long as they maintain primary responsibility for the children equal pay let alone salaries of over 25000 a year seems to me a distant dream In discussing this suspicion with a friend I tentatively suggested that we might just have to wait a few years for younger women to come to terms with the real issues of feminism She thought I was nuts They wont be radicalized she said Theyll just pout Perhaps but I think that at the very least their unexamined expectations may explain why they dont identify with feminism It must seem like yet another unnecessary compromise When driving into my hometown of Sharon Pa I hunkered down to get a better look out the window Things are bad when the mills are not puffing out smoky clouds With an unemployment rate of 147 percent the options for Sharon residents are limited For Sale signs stand like vigilantes in front of empty houses The Buhl Mansion a Romanesque monstrosity in which Sharons first captains of industry once lived now houses the WilMar Campus of Cosmetology And the hottest entrepreneur in town is the cemetery owner who gained national attention by planting a flag in his graveyard every day during the Iranian hostage crisis Today one must pass by the 444 Flags Museum to visit an ancestors grave site Given the conservative underbelly of Sharon I expected that young women there might not be sophisticated about feminism I was right but they saw the issues clearly Linda Manes a 21yearold just a few months out of college was quick to call herself a feminist I think every woman is a feminist to some extent she said In certain situations even those women who dont think they are will think Hey thats wrong you shouldnt treat me like that  Paula Gadola a 23yearold medical secretary said Feminism means equal rights so Im a feminist But Im not a womens libber Ah I thought the trigger words are different here Women dont receive the same pay as men and thats what the womens movement should do something about she explained Also harassment Men turn it around so it looks like your fault If that happened to me Id speak up In turn she went on women should take equal responsibility for equal rights In the mill some girl working the slag heap complained to my boyfriend that her shovel was too heavy that she wanted him to help her do her work Thats not fair As an aside Miss Gadola told me that though her boyfriend had been laid off he still paid for their entertainment In fact most of the young women I spoke to  including feminists and not just in Sharon  expect not to go dutch on dates Cindy Adams a pseudonym she requested for privacy is 24 years old and a newlywed She agrees with feminism but hesitates to call herself a feminist The abortion issue separates me from organized feminism Im against it Also though women should be treated like equals in the workplace I think families operate better if the man makes the decisions This isnt exactly the stuff that NOW membership drives are made of but Mrs Adams speaks with an unusual honesty about certain feminist issues I was raped when I was in ninth grade she told me And I feel angry for all women when I think about it She paused Women still need to work at getting rid of ads and stuff on television that are denigrating to women Mrs Adams recently lost her job as a youth counselor perhaps she suggested because I spoke up against what I thought was discrimination Id never let a guy make any moves on me in an office Id never sit still if I thought I wasnt getting the same pay as a guy And if I thought all the women in a place were being discriminated against Id try to organize them When I got back to New York I called another Sharon expatriate At 24 Mindy Werner reminds me of myself at 24 An assistant editor at a publishing company she is committed to feminism though she admits to having been around too many feminists for whom going to the bathroom is a political issue When I asked Miss Werner how her relationships with men differed from her relationships with women I felt as though I had pushed a button Ive only been romantically involved with men she explained so Ive only been burned in that way by men but it seems that women are a little less selfcentered more open more willing to share and listen Im always struggling between my political and theoretical beliefs and my personal life I spew feminism but then Billy calls me on the phone and Im all twittery I think women still feel a little guilty about sex so we deal with it by thinking that sex is love I actually feel moments of pity for men she admitted All these nice guys who were taught they were Gods gift  They almost cant help it that theyre pigs Cheryl Abrams Savit a 23yearold tour coordinator for mens tennis who has been married a year is understanding about her husbands oldfashioned habits He grew up in a very traditional family she explained simply He has this very funny thing He wants me to be independent at work but he wants his laundry to be done So a woman comes in to clean Its not that I have to clean up after him  he puts the dishes in the sink and I put them in the dishwasher  but I worry because I want him to be a good example for our kids I dont want anybody to think that its sissy to do the laundry or that its sissy to cook But Mrs Savit continued I also believe in putting girls in pink and boys in blue The differences between men and women are good Besides feminism has made men more flexible The question of whether feminism had changed men got a rise out of almost everybody Feminism has made things difficult for some of us who like chivalry Marian Briffa told me and a lot of romance is lost Jessica Jackson was smiling but she came down hard Sure men have changed Theyve become sneakier craftier angrier more insecure and more misogynist Theyre afraid theyre going to be castrated Speaking generally men either want to own a woman or be one Georgia Epstein another transplanted Sharonite feels sorry for men Feminism has made men more confused and theres some resentment Miss Epstein also feels some resentment At 24 she is a graduate of Columbia University and has just entered a masters program at the University of Pennsylvania but she is a nurse One of the problems with organized feminism she told me is that women who have chosen traditional roles as homemakers workingclass women who have always worked and found a way to have a family and women like me who have chosen careers like nursing have been denigrated They say to me Why arent you a doctor They give no credit to the fact that Im doing what I want to do Miss Epstein said Ive been discriminated against and been treated badly by doctors but its not something Ive done something about I dont think I have the right to call myself a feminist She sounded almost wistful as she went on Its like this whole punk thing of putting together clothes of really different styles Its the same with feminism The original clothing styles werent ours and the revolution wasnt ours So we put together our own kind of feminism which has very little activism in it I wish that I had had a revolution to go to a cause to believe in My life has been lacking in the kind of upheaval that allowed women to become feminists There were plenty of revolutions to go to in the late 60s and one of the best ones seemed to be taking place in Ithaca NY We argued about everything though it seems in retrospect that feminism took a back seat to antiwar activism and black separatism Most of my female friends for instance thought they would work few of us actually prepared for a profession Things are different now at Cornell Fortyfive percent of this falls entering class are women we made up only 28 percent of the class of 72 Twentyfive percent of the once allmale College of Engineering will be female this year No one has curfews anymore and parietals is a word lost from college vocabularies when coed dormitories made visiting hours obsolete Lizabeth Chabon McOsker a 24yearold member of the class of 80 told me that she got into feminist activities by playing nonvarsity rugby A lot of women in the club were feminists and exposure to them made me think about feminism I didnt tell her that I acknowledged my feminism in a sorority the first place I realized that women could be as smart  and as eccentric  as men I should have told her that women who wanted to play squash at Cornell used to have to wait until late at night when the men were through with the courts But Mrs McOskers description of Cornell made me think college may no longer be a good place to have ones consciousness raised I had read about the social and political throwback that had taken place on campuses in the late 70s but it took me a while to figure out the acronym when Mrs McOsker said In 1976 a lot of women were at Cornell basically for their MRS Never had 32 felt so old Memory is selective  and I wouldnt like to be judged now by everything I said 10 years ago  but I really felt that things had been different when I was in school that women were different when I started working And if the truth be known I felt that we had been better Twentytwoyearold Carmen Velasquez made me reconsider She came to the United States from Ecuador seven years ago with her two sisters and her mother who is a machine operator in a factory Today Miss Velasquez is in her fourth year at John Jay College where she is president of the Womens Awareness Club and she plans to go to law school Ill be the first attorney in my family she told me Im already the first feminist That was hard because my family is very traditional People try to reject change People forget and go back to the same old ways The fight has to be a continuous thing Mao Zedong couldnt have said it better I told myself to calm down At least some of the women I spoke to supported the equal rights amendment And more important all of them believe in equal pay for equal or comparable work  something that was certainly not always true Similarly all of them like all of my friends dream of creating a happy fulfilling relationship with a person they love Younger women just call their beliefs moderate while 10 years ago we knew they were radical But there is a crucial difference By my lights too many of todays young women are unwilling to act to speak up to fight against the inequalities that affect not only them but the rest of the worlds women What does it say about women when we lead a hateful backlash against lesbianism How can legislative backsliding be prevented let alone further advances toward equality be made if women become lazy about naming the inequalities around them I cannot presume to come up with answers for everyone For me however talking to these younger women was a radicalizing experience Ive recalled the significance of admitting the loneliness fear and economic danger of speaking up against sexual harassment and unfair labor practices  and of confessing that I am occasionally too tired to do it myself How else can I expect others to be courageous Ive remembered how crucial it is to concede that I dont yet know all the rules for a full and satisfying relationship with a man How else can I expect younger women to continue a battle for which they didnt enlist And Im going to try to convince my friends to reaffirm their feminism too Perhaps before its too late other women can rediscover as I did the simple pleasure  and the importance  of talking to women Perhaps women can then finally learn to stop blaming one another for the injustices that surround us
CLOSE RACES SEEN FOR STATE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/nyregion/close-races-seen-for-state-senate.html,NEARLY twothirds of Long Islands nine State Senate seats could be involved in close contests in next months election according to Democratic and Republican leaders Several factors account for the unusual competition in the State Senate races which Republicans have historically dominated Indeed veteran politicans could not recall the last time a Democrat was elected to the State Senate from a district completely within Nassau or Suffolk County The Island delegation is now divided 81 with the lone Democrat State Senator Carol Berman of Lawrence now representing a district that includes a part of predominately Democratic southeastern Queens Her new district will be wholly within Nassau as a result of a shift eastward of population and Senate district lines This shift reflected in the decennial reapportionment is one factor in the large number of potentially close contests Many of the Republican incumbents are representing new areas as a result of the reapportionment Another factor is an unusual number of wellknown Democratic elected officials who are running at least partly because of recruiting efforts and promises of aid by the State Senate minority leader Manfred Ohrenstein Even Kent Sanders the GOP State Senate aide who coordinates the effort for GOP candidates conceded that Suffolk Democrats have come up with pretty attractive candidates The arithmetic is not attractive however In all cases the Democrats are running against Republican enrollment majorities of up to 21 Mr Ohrenstein suggested another ironic factor He noted that many of the Democrats had expected to be running on a ticket headed by Mayor Edward I Koch a ticket that they figured would be unusually strong in the suburbs That is not to be but Mr Ohrenstein said that he still expected Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo the Democratic candidate for Governor to help the ticket because of his appeal particularly to ItalianAmericans the predominant ethnic group on the Island Mr Sanders does not believe that the gubernatorial contest will have an impact The incumbency factor is so strong he said referring to the legislative races As Mr Ohrenstein sees it the key races in order of his priority  and thus the funds and manpower of the State Senate Democratic campaign committee  are Senator Bermans effort to retain her seat in the ninth Senate district against a strong Republican effort by Assemblyman Dean Skelos Supervisor Patrick R Vecchio of Smithtowns campaign to unseat State Senator James Lack in the second district Suffolk County Legislator John Foleys challenge of State Senator Caesar Trunzo in the third district Suffolk County Legislator Wayne Prospects campaign against State Senator Owen Johnson in the fourth district Barbara Blumbergs second attempt in a year to defeat State Senator Michael J Tully in the seventh district and the effort of John Worthley to defeat State Senator Ralph J Marino in the fifth district which straddles the NassauSuffolk line Anthony J Prudenti the Suffolk Republican chairman agreed that the LackVecchio race was close He said that he was not too concerned about the other Suffolk races although he acknowledged that Mr Trunzo faced one of the stiffest challenges of his career Mr Sanders said that we have high hopes of defeating Mrs Berman and was optimistic that Mr Lack and other Republicans would win He questioned Mr Ohrensteins estimates of how much money the Democratic campaign committee would contribute to Mr Vecchio and other Democratic candidates saying that campaign financial reports indicate that the Senator does not have that much money available He noted that Mr Vecchio had received a total of 22000 according to the latest financial reports not the 50000 that Mr Ohrenstein spoke of There appears to be general agreement that three Republican incumbents  Kenneth LaValle of the first district John Dunne of the sixth and Norman J Levy of the eighth  are strong favorites to win reelection The following is a rundown on the other districts Ninth District Assemblyman Skelos 34 years old is regarded as one of Joseph M Margiottas proteges which is both a political plus and a minus The plus is the Nassau Republican organizations pouring more than 100000 into the district including television advertising that will be of interest to only a small portion of the metropolitan area viewing audience The minus is that Mrs Berman is making an issue of Mr Margiotta the Nassau Republican chairman and his conviction on Federal mail fraud and extortion charges Another unusual issue in this race is Mrs Bermans change of mind on the death penalty voting to override Governor Careys veto of such legislation at the last session after consistently voting against such bills Mrs Berman who is 59 and seeking her third term argues that she is representing her constituency on the issue now Mrs Berman faces a stiff test according to the enrollment arithmetic in the district She now represents a district with a Democratic enrollment majority In the new district Republicans have a 75 edge Second District Mr Ohrenstein is backing up his optimism about this race with what he says is at least 50000 in contributions from the Senate campaign committee to Mr Vecchio who has proved to be the strongest Democratic votegetter in Suffolk  winning Smithtown two times Because of the reapportionment that town now accounts for nearly half the electorate in the new district that has shifted eastward away from Mr Lacks strength in Huntington Brookhaven with about 30 percent of the vote and new territory for both candidates will very likely be the key to victory Mr Lack a former Suffolk County consumer affairs commissioner points to his twoterm record in the Legislature while Mr Vecchios main thrust is summed up in a brochure with the heading The man who shook up politics in Smithtown Mr Vecchio made the midlife jump to politics from an unusual platform He was a New York City detective who provided security for former Mayor John V Lindsay and other notables Third District Mr Ohrenstein has upgraded the chances of success in this contest because he said he was impressed with Mr Foleys campaigning and the cooperation of other Democrats such as Assemblyman I William Bianchi Both Mr Foley a 63yearold former high school teacher and Mr Trunzo a 56yearold accountant are proven winners Mr Foley who is not risking his county legislator post is counting on an aggressive and wellfinanced campaign and a shift eastward in the district away from Mr Trunzos base in Islip and into southern Brookhaven where Mr Foley is strong However Mr Trunzo is counting on the Islip Republican organization and the fact that Islip still constitutes threequarters of the district He also has Conservative and RighttoLife Party support Fourth District Another Democratic county legislator Mr Prospect is challenging Mr Johnson a veteran of 10 years in the Legislature who managed to stave off a threatened primary challenge but is now facing an aggressive generalelection opponent Mr Prospect is making issues of two controversies  the Long Island Lighting Company Shoreham Nuclear Plant and the proposed MultiTown garbage disposal plant on the grounds of the Pilgrim State Hospital in Brentwood Mr Prospect represents in the County Legislature the area adjacent to the proposed garbage plant Mr Prospect opposes both while Mr Johnson tempers his support of Shoreham with a proposal that its capital costs be phased into the Lilco rate structure rather than be reflected as soon as the plant goes into operation next year Mr Johnson sponsored the legislation that paved the way for MultiTown a joint effort of Babylon and Huntington towns Several politicans noted that it was unusual to find such volatile issues in a legislative race Seventh District Democrats are not as optimistic about this contest as they were earlier this year when Mrs Blumberg a 54yearold former Councilwoman came within 3000 votes of defeating Mr Tully in a special election The seat had been held by the late John Caemmerer a Republican who consistently won with heavy pluralities Mr Tully has never lost an election in nine attempts while Mrs Blumberg has lost two in the last year  the North Hempstead town council post last year and the State Senate special election earlier this year She had been the first Democrat elected to a full fouryear term on the town board in 70 years Unlike most Island contests there are clear ideological differences between the two on such issues as abortion the death penalty and gun control with Mrs Blumberg taking the liberal positions and Mr Tully the conservative Fifth District Mr Worthley a 36yearold professor of public management at Seton Hall University in New Jersey believes that Mr Marino may have been weakened by his past identification with Mr Margiotta who had selected him as first vice chairman of the county organization as well as an Oyster Bay GOP leader However others believe that Mr Marinos public feuding with Mr Margiotta over the effort to depose Mr Margiotta from his party positions may have strengthened him Mr Marino said he thought he had been helped by his break with Mr Margiotta although he noted that my opponent is still trying to tie me with Margiotta Mr Marino said that Margiotta aides had said that the county organization which has its own print shop would provide literature for him as it does for all GOP candidates But I havent seen anything yet Mr Marino added that Im not breathlessly waiting His vote politicians believe could provide a measure of the impact on voters of the break with Mr Margiotta In the last two elections he has won by at least 21
CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS: A TROUBLED HERITAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/style/children-of-alcoholics-a-troubled-heritage.html,The Governors Conference on Children of Alcoholics began with the reading of a letter from Jason Rolbards the actor Mr Robards wrote that he had been the child of an alcoholic and he urged Please dont stop with the parents Help the children too The conference believed to be the first to be called by the governor of any state tried to do just that Meeting Thursday and Friday in the New York Statler Hotel legilators government officials members of the clergy and professionals in the treatment of acoholism discussed ways of helping what some of them called the hidden victims of alcoholism  the children This is a major health problem for the United States Joseph A Califano Jr told the 600 who attended the conference He said at the opening session that seven million people under the age of 20 or one out of every 20 currently live with an alcoholic parent Directed Study of Children Mr Califano who was Secretary of Health Education and Welfare in the Carter Administration was in charge of a New York State study on children of alcoholics The study released last July found that 500000 children in the state lived in families where there was an alcoholic and that these children were four times more likely than other children to become alcoholics themselves Children of alcoholics never get the kind of special attention theyre getting at this conference Mr Califano said adding that he hoped that the study and conference would spawn new policies to help the children The Governors wife Evangeline GouletasCarey honorary chariman of the conference announced the formation of the Children of Alcoholics Foundation to reveive funds to help such children The foundation will be run by Migs Woodside a former assistant commissioner of New York Citys Addition Services Agency who prepared the state study Conference Became Emotional Governor Carey said he had written to the governors of the 49 other states suggesting that they follow New Yorks lead in helping the residents of their states better understand the prblems of children of alcholics The conference often grew emotional expecially in workshops when the professionals many the children of alcoholics themselves told of their own experiences and what had happened to the children with whom they had worked Caren F a recovered alcoholic in her mid30s who now works with Bowery alcoholics burst into tears in a workshop on child abuse and neglect when she recalled her own childhood She had been asked to form a family sculpture a popular method of treating children of alcoholics in which she chose people from the workshop to represent her family members The volunteers than acted out a scene directed by Caren in which her father came home drunk and beat her with a razor strap Shaken Caren said I felt just like I was back there when I was 4 10 and 16 years old I never though Id feel that anger again She said that she had begun drinking at the age of 13 and that she came home intoxicated noisy and boisterous a lot like my father She said she finally quit drinking through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous Sharon Wegscheider of Minneapolis president of Onsite Training and Consulting which works with the families of alcoholics told a menary session that the children of alcoholics generally adopt one of those four survival roles The family hero This child often the oldest works very hard to get family approval He is an overachiever who wants to please If he excels he becomes the familys representative to the outside world The scapegoat This child feel he is being emotionally rejected and uses defiance to pay back the family The child antagonizes the parents and gets most of the familys negative attention The scapegoat provides a focus that keeps the attention off the drinking parent The last child This child learns to avoid close connections in the family He spends much time being alone or quietly busy He suffers intense pain and loneliness He is seen by parents as being independent the one who can take care of himself The family mascot This child often the youngest is not taken too seriously mostly because of his age He is often hyperactive and uses humor and obnoxious behavior as a way of getting attention Miss Wegscheider whose mother and father were alcoholics mentioned several children of alcoholics she had worked with recently describing them in a social workers shorthand A 24yearold man graduate school student outstanding athlete ulcers severe colitis chest pains A 22yearold woman angry migraine headaches sexual identity issues incest survivor anorexic An 18yearold girl chemical abuser depressed over early abortion currently pregnant again off chemicals does not want to hurt baby school dropout on probation for shoplifting A 10yearold girl in special education classes shy has frequent colds and flu extreme sadness dependent on teachers has few friends A 7yearold boy hyperactive victim of child abuse doing poorly in school disliked by teachers and kids has nervous tic in right eye Many experts at the conference advocated residential treatment for the families of alcoholics One such center is St Josephs Rehabilitation Center in Saranac Lake NY run by the Rev Bernard Palka a Roman Catholic priest He said that nearly 100 alcoholics and their family members had received treatment since the center started admitting them last February Each family stays for five days If you treat the alcoholic without treating the family system one of three things is bound to happen Father Palka said The alcoholic will have a relapse or another family member will go into crisis or the couple will get a divorce The use of intervention in which an alcoholics family lovingly confronts the alcoholic abou this or her drinking and urges treatment was also highly recommended at the conference Some people think its kind of mean and horrible a whole lot of people ganging up on an alcoholic said Mona Mansell founder and president of the Freedom Institute a treatment center in New York City But if its performed correctly its one of the most loving processes that can take place Few children under 18 attended the conference Among those who did were three girls from an Alateen chapter in Dutchess County who conducted an open meeting to give conference participants an idea of how Alateen a selfhelp group for teenagers works The girls  Debbie 15 Carolyn 15 and Betsy 13  all chainsmoked as they described how they had gone to Alateen because of problems at home caused by alcoholic fathers Debbie said she had been referred to the group by an eighth  grade English teacher after he noticed she was so depressed that she sat by the window every day and cried in class I was really lonely she recalled Mom went to work and Dad went out drinking I took care of hte house and my younger sister One day Dad came home and beat Mon up He used to be the one I loved the most but after what he did to my mother I loved her the most Alateen she said gives me the incentive to try to love him again

ABROAD AT HOME; SENATOR JOE'S GHOST,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/18/opinion/abroad-at-home-senator-joe-s-ghost.html,It is a 30second spot shown often these evenings on Boston television channels As the advertisement starts there on the screen is a blackandwhite still picture of Representative Barney Frank A voice says Barney Frank says you can trust him But look at his record As a State Legislator he sponsored a bill to permit legalized prostitution and allow Combat Zones in every city and town in Massachusetts He voted against increased penalties for criminals who distribute pornography to minors And last year he voted to reduce the sentence for violent rape As the voice speaks printed words are superimposed on the picture of Representative Frank Prostitution Pornography Then at the end the ad cuts to a film clip in color of Mr Franks election opponent Representative Margaret Heckler She is walking down the street smiling in the sunshine with an American flag waving in the background The voice says Keep Margaret Heckler She has a record we can be proud of The ghost of Joe McCarthy must be grinning For his techniques are still used in American politics And here they are being used by just the sort of Republican who used to be snooty about old Joe a supposed moderate one of those Eastern types who looked embarrassed when Joe did something dirty to win Once 30 years ago I had to untangle a speech of Senator McCarthys trying to separate the false from the true It was hard to do because he presented facts in such a way as to suggest conclusions that were the opposite of the truth That is exactly the technique of Mrs Hecklers advertisement Consider the sentence about Combat Zones That is the name given to a seedy area of downtown Boston where prostitutes hang out and bookstores sell pornography The ad suggests that Barney Frank when he was a member of the Massachusetts Legislature wanted to spread prostitution and pornography everywhere The opposite was true The bill introduced by Mr Frank would have allowed communities to restrict adult entertainment to specific zones The US Supreme Court in 1976 upheld an ordinance of that kind over dissent seeing a violation of the First Amendment The purpose was of course to limit the spread of pornography to keep it out of residential neighborhoods not to increase it Police and prosecutors in Massachusetts supported Mr Franks bill The last sentence of the Heckler ad suggesting that Mr Frank wanted to go easy on rapists is another prime example of how to deceive with facts It refers to a curious 1981 political episode in Washington The District of Columbia Government adopted a new criminal code The section on rape expanded the definition of the offense so as to make conviction easier It also reduced the maximum penalty from life in prison which was thought to make jurors reluctant to convict to 20 years The changes had the support of womens groups Then the Rev Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority decided to make an issue of the life sentence for rape Changing it they said was antifamily Conservatives in Congress led by Representative Philip Crane introduced a resolution to disapprove the criminal code revision  and carried it over the votes of Barney Frank and other Congressmen brave enough to oppose a slick piece of rightist politics that might in fact make the punishment of rapists less likely in Washington Liberals are not always pure in their political advertising Some of us cringe when we remember President Johnsons highly effective spot in 1964 suggesting that Barry Goldwater might start a nuclear war But the really nasty tactics are most often to be found on the extreme right A good example in 1982 is the campaign for Senator being waged by Representative Robin L Beard of Tennessee Because the incumbent Democrat Jim Sasser opposed an antiabortion bill he has been called a murderer who votes in favor of slaughtering little babies Beard television ads distort the record to accuse Sasser of trying to help Communist Cuba What is so puzzling is that Margaret Heckler should want to get into rightwing gutter politics She has served eight terms in the House of Representatives never in a leadership role but respectable and generally liked This year redistricting pushed Representative Frank a feisty liberal into the same district with her And she has seemed to turn into another person Mrs Heckler has not had real competition in a long time Could it be that she considers it lesemajeste for someone to run against her Is there so little in her life except politics that the possibility of defeat has made her desperate The voters sometimes see through McCarthyism but not always It may work But what would it profit Mrs Heckler to win the seat and lose her political soul

UNCONSTITUTIONAL NEW YORK ABORTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/opinion/l-unconstitutional-new-york-abortion-law-229410.html,To the Editor The Times recently published two news articles regarding a woman with the mental capacity of an infant who became pregnant and for whom a court order for an abortion was being sought An article of Sept 23 reported that the New York State Attorney Generals office had sought a court order for an abortion on the ground that the pregnancy posed a threat to the womans life A State Supreme Court justice denied approval on that ground The next day according to a Sept 24 article the abortion was approved by the same judge on the ground that her parents consent could be accepted as a substitute for the pregnant womans consent Both articles indicated that under New York law an abortion can be performed after 24 weeks only if the pregnancy is deemed to be lifethreatening That indeed is the law but the law is unconstitutional and has been for almost 10 years because it does not make any provision for healththreatening situations In 1973 the United States Supreme Court in Roe v Wade and Doe v Bolton rendered complex opinions with regard to the states role in the abortion decision Among other things it held that even in the latest stages of pregnancy a woman could not be denied an abortion if her life or health was endangered This recent case is a very good example of why unconstitutional laws cannot be allowed to remain on the books I was involved in the womens movement in New York in 1973 and many of us wanted to do something to challenge the constitutionality of the New York law However we were met with great resistance from many sources The issue of late abortions we were told was very sensitive We should not get involved in it for fear of a backlash from antiabortion groups and individuals In any event a plaintiff for such a case is obviously very difficult to find It now appears that we were right after all In the case of this unfortunate mentally retarded woman the abortion could easily have been authorized on the ground that the pregnancy was a threat to her health New Yorks abortion law was a liberalization of the prior law before 1970 but is now unconstitutional and should immediately be amended NANCY S ERICKSON Columbus Ohio Sept 28 1982 The writer is professor of law at Ohio State University
SOME G.O.P. CANDIDATES IN THE SUN BELT GAMBLE ON THE PRESIDENT'S; COATTAILS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/20/us/some-gop-candidates-in-the-sun-belt-gamble-on-the-president-s-coattails.html,After dusk chased the flickering sunlight off the north Texas plain 70 people gathered Tuesday night in the Chamber of Commerce offices to hear Jim Bradshaw from nearby Fort Worth contend that the latest surge in stocks proved President Reagan is on the right track and things are getting better At a time when many Republican Congressmen in the Northeast and Middle West are putting distance between themselves and Mr Reagan Mr Bradshaw is typical of the Sun Belt Republicans who ardently embrace the Reagan program hoping to ride the Presidents coattails into Congress His battle is among a score in newly drawn or markedly altered Congressional districts that are considered crucial to the outcome this fall Many are considered extremely close I believe in what the President is doing and know that he has to have a Congress to help pass his program Mr Bradshaw a dapper 42yearold businessman boomed enthusiastically I say give President Reagan more than a chance Give him a hand Give him Jim Bradshaw We have a Republican district and if you elect Tom Vandergriff then people around the country are going to say You see President Reagan is wrong  Personality Campaigning His Democratic opponent Mr Vandergriff for 26 years the Mayor of nearby Arlington Tex offered a studied contrast on all counts He has been quietspoken and reassuring His view of the contest was personal not national The news from Wall Street does not really mean all that much to those of us on Main Street he told the audience Its heartening in one respect to break the back of inflation Whats so disheartening is to realize that you dont have any money left to spend because of recession and with layoffs farm foreclosures and business bankruptcies at record highs Theres no way that this is a race between Ronald Reagan and Tom Vandergriff he said Jim wants to be the Presidents supporter Well I do too The way to do it is to put people back to work That is unusual political talk in a Sun Belt state that has long regarded itself as immune from the economic stagnation of the North It is an important debate because in such Sun Belt states as Texas Florida California New Mexico and Arizona and in such Western states as Oregon Washington Colorado and Utah and even in Tennnessee sharp fights are on for most of the 17 new Congressional seats shifted into these areas by the flow of Northerners to the South and West in the last decade There are also important battles for four other districts that were substantially reshaped from 1980 and that have no incumbent defending them Republican strategists regard these too as essentially new districts Primary Battlegrounds Nationally Democratic strategists regard these seats as lucrative targets to rack up important gains nationwide at Mr Reagans expense Republicans concede that if they are to hold the Democrats in check in the election they must perform well in these Congressional districts Each side sees the districts plus 37 others left vacant by retiring Congressmen as the prime battlegrounds that will swing the election in the House of Representatives So hotly contested are many of the 21 seats that Republican strategists now expect to win 10 of them They concede seven to the Democrats and consider four too close to call while Democratic strategists think they will take 11 the Republicans only six and that four are tossups Here in the new 26th District of Texas a suburban semicircle around southwestern Fort Worth that stretches north into two more rural counties and in the 25th District on the southern flank of Houston Democrats seemed better poised than Republicans to achieve success though that was not the way things looked last summer The Houston district stretching from the affluent suburb of Meyerland through heavily black Sunnyside to the bluecollar towns of Deer Park and Pasadena where the movie Urban Cowboy was filmed was set up to favor a Democrat Narrow Victory for Reagan In the Republican tide of 1980 Mr Reagan carried these areas by only 501 percent This year most politicians rate Mike Andrews a 36yearold lawyer making his third race for a Congressional seat as a Democrat as a modest favorite over Mike Faubion 34 a new right Reagan loyalist who has been strikingly well received in his first active run at politics after nine years in private law practice The district in the Fort Worth area carried by President Reagan in 1980 by 671 percent was set up to favor a Republican But Mr Vandergriffs long experience and wide bipartisan reputation and calm but pervasive campaigning have made it a close race one that he could possibly win against the odds I have a strong opponent concedes Mr Bradshaw who lost in 1980 to Jim Wright the House majority leader If it had been anybody but Vandergriff I could have gone to Europe and relaxed and come back to be inaugurated Some White House officials have contended that even if Democrats do win some of the new Sun Belt seats it will not hurt President Reagans prospects in Congress next year too much because he has previously won support from Southern conservative Democrats But neither Mr Vandergriff nor Mr Andrews fits that category and their elections would be a decided setback for the President in Congress Quarrels With Reagan Positions Mr Andrews a young former district attorney campaigns as a moderate who is quite at home with mainstream Democratic Party positions Not only does he forcefully oppose the President on constitutional amendments for school prayer abortion and balancing the budget but he advocates delaying the third year of the 1981 Reagan tax cut program and slowing down the growth of military spending to from 3 percent to 5 percent a year from the Reagan level of 10 or 11 percent a year Mr Faubion who favors the budget abortion and prayer amendments makes an issue of fighting crime by proposing a sixyear limit on the terms of Federal judges He ardently backs the Reagan economic program and seeks to cast his opponent as too liberal for Texas With an aggressive and expensive directmail campaign Mr Faubion has latched onto some of Mr Andrewss earlier ads used in black precincts showing him with an arm around Representative Mickey Leland a black Democratic Congressman who is anathema to many bluecollar and conservative Democrats in some of the Fort Worth suburbs Mr Bradshaw is also trying to emphasize differences with his opponent by attacking Mr Vandergriff as the endorsed candidate of union bosses and as a supporter of the Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts But Mr Vandergriff taking the advice of consultants has sought to depict the race as a local contest over who would work the harder who would be the most effective in bringing about a better quality of life for north Texas As Mayor Sought to Add Jobs He is one Democratic candidate who can quickly say how he would deal with rising unemployment by recalling that as Mayor of Arlington which grew from 8000 to 150000 people in his tenure he helped bring General Motors the Six Flags amusement park DallasFort Worth airport and the Texas Rangers baseball team to the area He proudly acknowledges support from labor leaders and goes on to cite endorsement by top business executives as well Both he and campaign aides assert that his politics though less conservative than Mr Reagans is conservative enough for the Republican Party to have tried initially to recruit him as its Congressional candidate Our polls show he wins enormously strong trust from voters of all stripes commented George Shipley of Austin the Vandergriff campaigns poll taker Hes a political Walter Cronkite While Mr Bradshaw works at projecting the differences between the candidates and warns voters against turning back from Reagan policies to what he calls the tax and tax spend and spend policies of Democratic Administrations Mr Vandergriff calmly responds that people are weary of seeing first one side and then the other side say its all the other guys fault Then he adds They want to see a bipartisan effort at solving our problems House Races in Key New Districts  Following is a list of 21 districts with sharply contested Congressional races Of these 17 are wholly new districts added to Sun Belt and Western states and Tennessee because of population shifts in the 1970s Four others three in California and one in Indiana

ABRAMS AND MISS SCLAFINI CLASH IN THEIR FIRST DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/20/nyregion/abrams-and-miss-sclafini-clash-in-their-first-debate.html,State Attorney General Robert Abrams described his agency as primarily a civil office yesterday then frowned as his opponent Frances A Sclafani challenged his definition and called him a lawyer who has never tried a criminal case In their first campaign debate Miss Sclafani the RepublicanConservative candidate also accused Mr Abrams of failure to act against dumpers of toxic waste in New York City and of malfeasance in supervising a special prosecution in Syracuse Mr Abrams the DemocraticLiberal candidate for a second term said he had acted properly in both cases He said he had compiled an outstanding record in running the secondlargest law office in the country the largest is the Federal Department of Justice that he had won big refunds for victimized consumers and had maximized his limited criminal jurisdiction In a discussion at The New York Times the two candidates also offered conflicting judgments on the states highest court the Court of Appeals Victims Rights Superseded The rights of the defendant have superseded the rights of the victim said Miss Sclafani an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County In deciding what evidence is too tainted for use in a trial she said the court has taken the doctrine of the fruit of a poisonous tree and turned it into a lemon She said voters should be able to decide whether judges should continue in office after they have been on the bench for a few years Mr Abrams countered I think the Court of Appeals is an outstanding judicial body He said he would support a public vote on retention of lowercourt judges but not for Court of Appeals judges The two smiled in greeting but Mr Abrams looked startled when in her first answer Miss Sclafani still smiling said sharply He has never tried a criminal case In fact he has never tried any major case My opponent is a politician She stayed on the attack through the 97minute session The Andreoli Fiasco Pulling a document from a heap on the table in front of her she criticized what she called the whole Andreoli fiasco This referred to an inquiry into charges of political corruption in Syracuse that was conducted by two successive special prosecutors in Syracuse and has now been completed Miss Sclafani displayed a letter to Mr Abrams from eight investigators in 1980 when it appeared that the inquiry might be called off charging that his public statements had obstructed the investigation Mr Abrams speaking slowly replied that he had not responded directly to the charges in the letter but had consulted with the special prosecutor Of course you had to Miss Sclafani said This was a hot potato Later Mr Abramss aides said some of the complaining investigators had written a statement in 1981 acknowledging that it was evident to them that the Attorney General did in fact seek and obtain funding to continue the investigation Shuffling through more documents Miss Sclafani said Mr Abrams had done nothing when poisonous wastes were found on Staten Island and in Long Island City Queens Mr Abrams replied that when the case came to his attention I personally called the Mayor I spoke to the Police Commissioner Miss Sclafani interjected Did he ever tell the people Did he issue a press release Calls Post a TwoFisted Job Afterward Mr Abramss aides said that the Staten Island case had been prosecuted by the District Attorney there and that in the Queens case Mr Abramss office had sued for damages Like a prosecutor Miss Sclafani interjected frequent comments and after a while Mr Abrams hit back After hes finished patting himself on the back Miss Sclafani said when he had spoken about his record Id like to point out that the Attorney General should be the peoples advocate In a twofisted job  civil and criminal he sat on the one fist Hes the chief law enforcement officer Mr Abrams interrupted The Attorney General is not the chief law enforcement officer he said Hes the chief legal officer Differ on Death Penalty They were asked about the death penalty I favor that in cases of violent premeditated murder Miss Sclafani said Im opposed Mr Abrams said But he noted that in his official role he would defend a capitalpunishment law Well thats a nice political statement Miss Sclafani said A moment later they were asked about governmentpaid abortions for poor women Mr Abrams said he favored them and Miss Sclafani said Its really not germane to this election I would enforce the law My private views have nothing to do with it Both endorsed a strong role for the Attorney Generals organizedcrime task force but Mr Abrams said he had already restructured a crippled unit and she said scornfully Hes beefing it up now Wheres he been for four years Both supported a unified state court system Both urged strong sentences for drunken driving Both favored public campaign financing I sure would said Miss Sclafani laughing She said she was being outspent 1 million to 30000 by Mr Abrams Mr Abrams said Republican candidates such as Senator Alfonse M DAmato had been able to count on immense contributions from the party I havent seen any Miss Sclafani said

IOWA GOVERNORSHIP RACE TIGHTENS UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/us/iowa-governorship-race-tightens-up.html,Roxanne Conlin the Democratic gubernatorial candidate who disclosed in July that she paid no state tax in 1981 appears to have made a considerable comeback in her race against Lieut Gov Terry Branstad The latest Iowa Poll involving 1009 Iowans of voting age showed that Mrs Conlin had moved within 4 percentage points of Mr Brandstad a Republican A month ago another Iowa Poll gave Mr Branstad a lead of 11 percentage points over Mrs Conlin They are competing for the office that Robert Ray a popular Republican is relinquishing after five terms In May after Mrs Conlin handily defeated two opponents in the primary election she held a lead of 45 percent to 38 percent That was before the disclosure that the 37yearold Mrs Conlin a former United States Attorney and assistant Iowa Attorney General and her husband James an investment broker and real estate developer paid 2995 in Federal income taxes and nothing in state taxes in 1981 despite a net worth of about 22 million Lost in Real Estate She Says Mrs Conlin said she earned 35000 that year as United States Attorney but that the income was eaten up by the losses in her husbands real estate business They were cash losses  losses due to an economy that has turned sour losses due to high interest rates factors over which I have no control she said It was also disclosed that the Conlins use of real estate tax shelters against which Mrs Conlin campaigned in the primary had been a factor in reducing their Iowa tax to zero Mrs Conlins explanation did not sit well with voters especially Republicans who remembered other remarks she made earlier in the year attacking Mr Branstad and other Republicans as belonging to the party of the privileged Then in August and September as the two candidates campaigned throughout the state and held several debates voter attitudes apparently changed One episode regarded as detrimental to Mr Branstad occurred when he told a group opposed to abortion that he would use his inaugural to stage a special celebration for them and would use his position as Governor to help raise money for their movement Mrs Conlin has also seemed to gain ground as the focus of the gubernatorial debate shifted to the economy and the states bleak employment picture Unemployment Key Issue Asked to identify the key issue of the campaign participants in the most recent Iowa Poll cited unemployment Among these voters Mrs Conlin was favored 2 to 1 In August the most recent month for which figures are available 83 percent of the states work force of 14 million was idle The figure contrasts with 66 percent a year earlier and 98 for the nation in that month In September the national rate rose to 101 percent However because many jobs in this state are seasonal the unemployment rate fluctuates significantly and earlier this year it was as high as 114 The two candidates differ sharply on what should be done The day after the most recent Iowa Poll was taken Mrs Conlin detailed a proposal under which the state would raise 300 million by selling bonds and use the money to put Iowans to work repairing roads and bridges and in projects to conserve water soil and energy This plan she said will put Iowans to work doing what Iowa needs to have done He Attacks Her Plan Mr Branstad said he had been advised by lawyers that the Conlin plan would be unconsitutional because it was not specific enough And besides he said the 660 million estimated total for the bonds and interest was too costly It is the kind of spendnow paylater philosophy that got us into trouble in the first place he said referring to the states deficit which has been estimated at 90 million Mr Branstad called for tax cuts and incentives to businesses as an inducement to create jobs Included in his proposal was the establishment of an investment mutual fund a bank that would raise money for investment loans by allowing Iowans to invest My approach is to encourage and assist the private sector to create real jobs he said not makeshift government jobs that are going to end in six months The states economy is a related issue In the four years that Mr Branstad has been lieutenant governor the state went from a 250 million surplus to a 90 million deficit He Disavows a Letter Mrs Conlin and other Democrats have also attacked her opponent for what they call his right wing views Television and radio advertisments have said that Mr Branstad opposed a number of legislative efforts that would have helped the poor and the handicapped There have also been repeated references to a fundraising letter that went out over his name in 1978 The letter which he said was the idea of the National Conservative Political Action Committee and which he said he signed against my better judgment contained a passage that said as for all the welfare giveaways I say theyre not worth a pitcher of warm spit Mr Branstad said he had repudiated the letter shortly after it was circulated Despite the narrowing of Mr Branstads lead voters still appear to prefer Mr Branstad in times of trouble Asked in the poll which candidate they would rather have in charge of Iowa government in a crisis the voters picked Mr Branstad by a wide margin
RACE FOR 28TH DISTRICT IN NEW YORK FOCUSING ON U.S. ECONOMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/nyregion/race-for-28th-district-in-new-york-focusing-on-us-economy.html,Matthew H McHugh has won four terms in the House of Representatives as a liberal Democrat from this largely rural and smalltown district in which the Republican registration is 457 percent compared with the Democratic figure of 319 percent This year the Republicans have come up with a candidate  David F Crowley  who they feel is their most viable challenger to Mr McHugh to date They have pumped in money from the national party and placed the 28th Congressional District seat on a short national list of those they hope can be captured from the Democrats Mr Crowley is also the candidate of the Conservative Party I wouldnt be here if we didnt feel David Crowleys election was important Vice President Bush said during a recent appearance here He described the district as clearly winnable Mr McHugh 43 years old is taking the challenge from Mr Crowley a 45yearold lawyer and former Broome County Republican chairman in stride He appears confident that he can survive the threat No Windfall for Republican For one thing the financial help from the Republican Party and messages from the United States Chamber of Commerce to its members to give immediate support to the businessoriented Mr Crowley have not amounted to a windfall of money The filings of the two candidates show that as of Oct 13 Mr Crowley had this year raised 165397 of his projected 411000 budget while Mr McHugh had raised 258450 In 1981 Mr McHugh raised approximately 40000 according to his campaign manager Joan Loehr However Mr McHugh is worried about the effect of some advertisements for Mr Crowley paid for by the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee One depicted Mr McHugh as an inveterate junketeer Another showed a pastiche of headlines about sex and drug scandals on Capitol Hill and suggests that it is time for a fresh face from the district Mr Crowley says the commercials were valid What has he done for this district Mr Crowley asked in an interview He is said to have good constituent services but maybe people are tired of all these spending programs What is believed to make Mr Crowley a more potent candidate than others who have tried to unseat Mr McHugh is his base in Broome County which takes in 43 percent of the district Supported on 2 Campuses Mr McHughs home base of Ithaca represents a small portion of the district But he has solid support there from the teachers and students of Cornell University and Ithaca College He has been particularly well liked in Ithaca since the late 1960s when as District Attorney he was a calming influence on an armed student occupation of the Cornell campus His support for the nuclear freeze his rejection of President Reagans economic policies and his efforts on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee to cut military aid to Central America have struck a responsive chord in the university community Mr McHugh succeeded Edward I Koch on the Appropriations Committee when the New York Mayor left Congress and he is regarded by state officials as a valuable advocate of the states interests In his seat on the subcommittee Mr McHugh has participated in six Congressional overseas trips in eight years I have to make judgments on foreign aid he said Surviving the Recession The national recession has left the district relatively unscathed From Cornell to the International Business Machines General Electric and Singer Link plants that have transformed Binghamton from an old factory town to a place of modern industry to the hotel complexes of the Catskills unemployment hovers around 75 percent Both candidates however talk about the national economy as the chief issue of the campaign Mr Crowley embraces Mr Reagan saying that the economic outlook is upbeat I get a strong feeling that people like what Reagan is doing Mr Crowley said The president of the Home Builders Association in Broome County told me a few weeks ago We havent been as busy in three years Mr McHugh while careful not to attack the President personally tells audiences that the policies of the Administration are wrong and unfair and suggests that it is time to slice into its defense requests Not an Unqualified Liberal Mr McHugh is regarded by many in the district as having taken a a liberal stand on many issues but he voted against a threeyear extension of the ratification process for the proposed equal rights amendment although he is in favor of its reintroduction in Congress He also opposes Medicaid financing of abortions and has not supported any guncontrol legislation Mr Crowley is against the renewed effort for an equal rights amendment favors a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in public schools and like Mr McHugh opposes Federal financing of abortions Mr Crowleys first outing as a political candidate has not been entirely smooth Mr McHugh pointed out that Mr Crowley owed taxes on property he owned and the matter received coverage in the local press And asked how he would balance the

LIFE AMONG THE RUSSIANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/magazine/life-among-the-russians.html,Marc Greenfield a graduate student at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs worked as an English editor for the Soviet Novosti Press Agency in Moscow from 1979 to 1981From the window of my apartment on Leninsky Prospekt I had a view of two ponderous ornate semicircular buildings that rose on either side of the broad thoroughfare several blocks away They were the gate to Stalins Moscow symbolizing the dictators concern with display Beyond these monoliths the road with its solid squat apartment houses remained a showpiece of Soviet architecture for thirdworld dignitaries whose limousines flew up and down the avenue in impressive motorcades to and from the Vnukovo airport My building was somewhat different It was typical of the raw massproduced apartment blocks that went up all over the country in the decade after Stalins death as the Soviet Unions new leader Nikita Khrushchev undertook a crash program to relieve the countrys desperate housing shortage The people somewhat ungratefully called these dwellings khrushchoby a play on the word trushchoby or tenements The contrast between the pompous edifices up the street and my own shabby abode was as good a symbol as I could find of the gulf between the Soviet Unions pretentious front and its inner reality Yet cheerless and cramped though my tworoom apartment may have seemed by Western standards the allocation of that amount of living space to a single person was wasteful luxury by Soviet criteria I remedied the situation by marrying a Russian woman whom the authorities permitted to leave the country with me And I was in a privileged position in another way Unlike foreign diplomats correspondents and businessmen who are forced to live in special compounds and find it difficult to break out of their isolation I was able to live and work among the Russians and observe Soviet society from within For two years from 1979 to 1981 I worked in Moscow for the Novosti Press Agency which always has two or three people on its staff for whom English is their native language Their job is to help the agency make its English texts resemble English no mean task I was hired after years of Soviet studies at McGill University and after spending four months in Leningrad University perfecting my command of Russian The vantage point afforded me by my unusual position in Moscow has left me with an impression of an exhausted society trying to catch up with the West while hiding its backwardness from foreign eyes  far different from the menacing image of resolute Slavs girding for struggle with America that we often receive at home A symbol of this less terrifying Russia greeted me when I reported at Novosti Press Agency to start work It was a huge colored poster across the street that read Communists Early fulfillment of plans is the promise of success The poster hung in a new wing that had been under construction for more than five years That plan seemed no nearer fulfillment on the day I left Moscow than on the day I arrived Another of my favorite Moscow posters stood on Moscows Garden Ring Road which encircles the capitals downtown section Forward to Communism it exclaimed The authorities finally took it down realizing the unfortunate imagery of a slogan like that on a road leading nowhere One of the first rules I learned at Novosti was that office work in Russia is something you structure around expeditions to some store within walking or riding distance For several hours a day various Russian colleagues who should have been at their desks were out shopping Their superiors turned a blind eye to their absence How else could most Muscovites cope with a situation in which the necessities of life are permanently in short supply Hordes of people from the countryside descend on the capital daily to empty the store shelves Everything depends on hearing in time about some store that has just got in a new supply of food clothes or other consumer items and on getting there before the supplies run out The situation was especially hard on the women in our office most of whom had to be both breadwinners and housekeepers since Russian husbands traditionally will not help with cooking and household chores regarding that as unmanly The rumor grapevine that kept track of what was in stock on any particular day was known by the Russian initials OBS standing for Odna baba skazala or One woman said When word reached us that one woman said she saw say mushrooms on sale at a certain store there was often a quick strategy session and a volunteer was sent to make purchases for all interested parties Other times the women disappeared one by one If there was a phone call for one of them the proper procedure was to say I think shes gone to lunch Chances were the caller had heard the same rumor and wanted to get in on the purchase Incidentally I learned never to ask who was calling the retort was usually an offended And who are you Unwritten rules also govern behavior in a shopping queue The line often looks more like a mob but your place is strictly yours people run off to do other errands hoping to make it back in time as the line shuffles slowly to the sales counters and there is hardly ever any dispute about reclaiming your spot If you are not employed  and under Soviet law only married women and pensioners have the right not to work  entire days can be spent standing in line A woman friend of ours waited for eight hours one summer day outside a store that had received a delivery of Yugoslav shoes and boots She returned the next day at 630 AM to her reserved place RUSSIA 1st JUMPnumber 436 she told us  and was able to make her purchase at noon On a bus one summer day I overheard this conversation between two women one of them with a pair of Austrian boots Did you have to stand long Not very Only overnight Overnight You call that not long Its worse in winter when you have to sleep in the doorways This time it was fine It was warm Do they fit No two sizes too big But I wasnt going to stand in line for nothing After a while I began to wonder if Russians get a morbid pleasure from the mild misery that a line produces I have seen them stand in line for no reason  to go through a metro station door for instance even though two other doors are open Once I watched dozens of people line up to cross single file between two puddles although they could have walked around them My wife Olga surprised me one day by coming home with some fine Bulgarian grapes There had been a long line  a wait of several hours  before one counter and no line at a second counter selling the same grapes but from the bottom of the crates These she bought in no time at all Ostensibly the crowd thought the first counter had the better product But my theory is that most Russians have become so accustomed to standing in line for anything worth buying  often jumping into line first and only then asking what is on sale  that they automatically suspect something is wrong if there is no line Of course as I learned from watching my higherups at Novosti not all Russians must stand in line Even at a fairly low level of the bureaucracy many officials receive salaries high enough to enable them to buy things for a few extra rubles through the back door  on the black market At Novosti one of the editors would poke his head into our room every now and then and make some mysterious gestures to the other Russian editors He was taking orders for a zakaz a food package For middlelevel apparatchiki a broad selection of foodstuffs and consumer goods is available at special discount stores closed to the general public as are the hardcurrency stores for diplomats and other foreigners At the highest level there is home delivery of choice food items and imported foreign manufactures For all these more fortunate people I am convinced the queue is psychologically important as a symbol of the superior status they have worked so hard to achieve Maybe thats one reason so little is done to cut down on queues through more sensible marketing methods Which brings me to another reality of Russian life  the role of privilege At Novosti privileges in the form of goods and services were widely used to recruit informants whose job was to keep an eye on their fellow workers I came to know some who had the character to refuse the deal most however could not resist the offer with its promise of material advantages Having to get around Moscow like most Russians by public transportation or on foot I became keenly aware of another form of privilege that foreign residents with their cars are less exposed to I mean the privilege of sitting behind the wheel Private cars practically plow through crowds of pedestrians at the crosswalks whatever the law may be the common attitude is that being in a car bestows hierarchical advantage which should not be demeaned by yielding to a pedestrian The game is played by the same rules all the way up the social ladder The chauffered black Volga sedans of Government and Party officials speed down the streets cutting off the smaller privately owned cars The big Chaika and Zil limousines of the ruling elite zoom along in their special lanes ignoring pedestrians cars and traffic signals alike A third form of privilege is access to information One day at work I happened to come across a pile of reports issued by the Soviet press agency Tass Reading it I realized that this was not part of the agencys daily file for public consumption it was part of Tasss restricted service meant only for the eyes of middlelevel bureaucrats I had flipped through about 30 pages when the department chief entered the room Realizing what I was doing he told me brusquely to stop I explained that I had already read essentially the same material at a Western wireservice bureau but this made no difference He was upset because I was encroaching publicly on his authority his hardearned right to read a category of dispatches that was denied to others However I soon found that in dealing with other Soviet institutions I too was a person of some privilege by virtue of working for so prestigious an organization as Novosti When for instance my telephone was disconnected by mistake and I went to the local telephone office I was yelled at and told that it would take at least a month to restore service moreover I would have to pay a fine When Novosti called them about it my phone was reconnected within 15 minutes and I was offered an apology When I went around to several restaurants trying to reserve a table for my wedding reception no bribe sufficed But when Novosti called a beautiful table setting was arranged and no bribe was necessary I learned that in matters of this sort it was best not to do anything myself if I could help it Most of my Russian colleagues were very casual about their work One reason for this of course was the need to use working hours for shopping expeditions another was the poor pay I as a foreigner on contract was in a special category Lack of motivation seemed in fact to be widespread throughout the Soviet system With the exception of several dedicated scholars and military men the Russians I knew seemed unconcerned about working well I often heard them say They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work Novosti was a topheavy organization providing employment for everyone from language students to retired intelligence agents Most of the employees were concerned exclusively with furthering their careers and utilizing the privileges offered at work Only a handful of employees  real Party types  were entrusted with writing about current events The other writers or correspondents were given chunks of written material and explicit instructions on how to organize it into article form After being checked by an editor for political correctness an article would be sent to one of the language departments where it would be translated by a Russian staff member Then checked against the original it would be given to one of the foreign editors who was supposed to improve the quality of the translation After this the article would go to one of the Russian editors for final verificationRussia 2d Jump The translations came to my desk not in English but in what might be called an Englishing of Sovietese a bureaucratic jargon whose prime purpose is to keep the meaning ambiguous and blurred At first doing what I was hired to do I did my best to turn the texts into clear English But I quickly found that I was wasting my time Whenever I succeeded in improving a translation it would promptly be turned back into English Sovietese Unused to seeing thoughts expressed in a simple straightforward and unambiguous fashion they would change the texts back to something very much like the original uncorrected translation I once listened in on a seminar for Novosti journalists A senior editor explained how to write correctly One brave soul in the audience couched a question in a long politically safe introduction  as all Soviet writers do when they are about to say something potentially suspect He then asked How are we supposed to write convincingly about the Soviet economy when even before we release our next fiveyear plan Western specialists have already predicted its outcome The answer was that Novosti writers should stress the positive aspects of the economy and ignore the negative ones The permissive attitude toward absenteeism went hand in hand strangely enough with a rigid system of discipline Novosti editors would total up the number of grammatical translating or political mistakes allegedly made by each subordinate In case of a really serious error the guilty party was summoned to the department heads office for a severe reprimand The employee then had to write an explanation of why he or she had made the mistake and had to promise never to do it again This upset some people quite a bit However there were never any serious consequences since under a system committed to finding jobs for all a Soviet employee enjoys almost total job security Short of committing some political or financial crime it is practically impossible to be dismissed Much worse were the criticism sessions or letuchki at which the entire department staff gathered to criticize one person After the poor wretch had been made to feel like the lowest form of life on earth the department head who had usually initiated the process with a scathing attack would rise to commend the victim for the praiseworthy quality overall of his work The employee would take the floor expressing gratitude for his comrades very just criticism which had given him new insights into his work and promising to do better in the future Nobody took these meetings seriously except the persons informed that it was their turn to be criticized I once attended an open meeting of Novostis Communist Party cell Open meant that all Novosti employees including those who were not party members were invited to attend Five minutes after the meeting began I received a note from one of my superiors asking why I had not chosen to go home early All meetings are held during working hours This note was followed by a second and a third asking the same question in other ways The next day another boss called me in to explain that although everybody was invited to attend these meetings I was not Obviously my superiors did not want me to see my Soviet colleagues lack of interest in party sessions  the reading and chatting that went on the catcalls that greeted anybody who prolonged the discussion There were also meetings at work to propagate basic information about civil defense Such sessions are conducted throughout the country judging from the ones at Novosti they are not taken very seriously either At the one meeting I attended I saw people catching up on their reading during the lecture or even taking naps The information dispensed was of a very rudimentary nature where to take shelter in basements and the subway system where to find food and water and so on in case of a nuclear attackRussia 3rd Jump An example of the level of civildefense information available in the Soviet Union was a short film made in the early 1960s and occasionally shown at movie theaters It told viewers how to make protective gauze masks The film carefully avoided any description of what the masks would be protecting them from The civildefense posters that hung in every apartmentbuilding managers office I saw were equally simplistic One for example explained how to recognize a nuclear explosion another showed happy people being dug out of the rubble by men in radiation suits Many Russians I talked to believed that these measures however futile were the Governments way of reassuring the people that if war came the country would not be as unprepared as it had been on the eve of the Nazi invasion When another civildefense meeting was scheduled at Novosti I was called in by the chief editor of the English section a retired army officer who spoke only a few words of English All smiles he asked me how I was doing at my job before getting to the point Marc he said why dont you leave early today I replied that I preferred to stay But Marc he persisted I dont understand If you can go home early why dont you go home I said I was curious about the coming meeting Finally he cleared his throat and explained that although the civildefense meetings were open to all at Novosti that did not include me In fact he said I was the first foreign employee in their department who had actually wanted to attend After that I left early whenever meetings were scheduled Like most Americans I knew that despite its advanced space and military programs the Soviet Union was backward on the level of everyday technology But it wasnt until I lived among the Russians adopting Russian ways that I realized the extent of that backwardness Desk calculators were only beginning to go on sale in Moscow and the most sophisticated model cost an engineers monthly salary of 130 rubles 195 by the official exchange at the time Most stores still used abacuses and banks had no electronic calculators The State Bank for Foreign Trade one of the countrys most important foreigncurrency handlers was still conducting daily transactions by hand with the aid of some desk calculators One out of every four phone calls I made while in Moscow produced wrong numbers and the percentage was not much better for incoming calls Friends told me of one family privileged enough to be allowed an occasional trip abroad which returned with an American washing machine They plugged it in turned it on  and overloaded the entire apartment blocks electrical system The gap between the best and the commonly available is particularly pronounced in the field of health care Most clinics and hospitals for the countrys rulers rely on imported technology while those for the population at large are poorly built and equipped Although the Soviet state provides free medical care at the neighborhood clinic the quality of treatment can be so poor and the wait so long that many Russians prefer to treat themselves at home using homeopathic medicines or to pay doctors an illegal fee to receive prompt attention The Soviet ambulance service has one very good feature There is a doctor for each ambulance The Russian name for the service  Skoraya Pomoshch or Fast Aid  is however a misnomer since it can take several hours to respond to an emergency call When I tore a tendon in my leg in Leningrad an ambulance arrived 90 minutes after my call The doctor a woman reluctantly agreed to take me in for Xrays of my greatly swollen ankle At the hospital I had to manage five flights of stairs to the emergency room without help from her or any of the attendants They took an Xray and told me I had a minor sprain I got home by tram with the help of two friends The injury  diagnosed correctly when I visited New York two months later finally healed by itself Another time I was hospitalized for a week in Moscow with infected tonsils and a high fever The doctor without taking any culture specimens prescribed massive injections of penicillin This I later discovered is a common procedure Standard antibiotics are prescribed without testing for resistance or allergic reaction I was later to learn that penicillin was ineffective against the infection I had been suffering from  and had overcome apparently through sheer rest My Russian friends had a grinandbearit attitude toward medical treatment It often seemed to me from their stories that when in doubt Soviet doctors choose the more painful form of treatment  injections for instance instead of pills Many painful treatments such as drilling teeth draining sinuses and even performing abortions are generally administered without anesthesia I dont know if theyre right but most Russians I talked to are convinced that the authorities want to keep abortions painful though legal in order to discourage their use at a time when the proportion of real Russians compared with nonRussian ethnic groups in the Soviet Union has decreased to a little over 50 percent Russian couples in Moscow with their low salaries and small apartments usually prefer to have only one child The Government offers financial subsidies to large families but the sums involved do not cover the expense of supporting even a single child Gynecologists offices have antibirthcontrol posters on display One poster I saw showed a man and a woman staring glumly into an empty crib the legend read Without children life is empty Another poster depicted a woman sitting desolately in a playground filled with children The caption What does the future hold in store Barrenness Representative Russians rather than members of the intellectual or official class seemed to me to live in a mixedup mental world They regard themselves as the liberators not the occupiers of Eastern Europe and they cannot understand why there should be such great ill will toward them in those countries which  they are well aware  enjoy higher living standards than they do They are particularly perplexed by the fuss made over Poland since the Poles are known to be slouches who already live too well for their own good In their talks with me Russians visualized the outside world as a hostile camp ready to tear them apart However they regarded the United States with great respect and curiosity and were tremendously impressed by what they knew of the American standard of living On the other hand Soviet society with all its faults seemed to meet their most important needs This is the first generation of Russians since their revolution that has not known war or starvation and their living standards though low by our criteria are higher than most Russians can remember As for freedom they seem to find enough of it in Russias vast open spaces and in freedom from economic insecurity With jobs guaranteed by the state people can spend their last ruble without worrying about the next paycheck Moreover most Russians seem engrossed by their very special brand of human relations Nothing is more essential to a Russians happiness than acquiring good friends maybe its because it is so hard to acquire anything else An evenings entertainment is likely to involve a social gathering All night long you talk eat and drink I think it is these conversations that are Russias main charm and attraction for the foreigner The breadth of the topics discussed is exhilarating and reveals the eclectic nature of the Russian intellectual At first I wondered how my friends expected me to meet practically every night and go to work in the morning It took little time to realize that if you dont take your job too seriously if there is no real threat of being dismissed and your meager salary will always be there you need not worry about coming to work exhausted or a little hung over It is job security beyond our wildest dreams that makes these nightly sessions possible My circle of friends was linked with others in Moscow which in turn were linked with circles in other cities so that I found myself part of a network of friends covering the entire country On the principle that any friend of a friend is a friend of mine I found myself accepted warmly and without question by people from various walks of life But I had to be careful not to abuse their hospitality for Russians will serve you with the best they have in their homes regardless of its cost or scarcity By allowing myself to be entertained on what might seem to me a modest scale I could well be depleting a familys scarce food supplies I never met a Russian who would hesitate to offer the couch in his small apartment to a friend who dropped in without warning For reasons it would take a more scientific approach to plumb I also found the average Russian inordinately dependent on alcohol Each Friday afternoon the buses and the metro were full of office workers who had obviously got a head start on the weekend Everybody drank and nobody talked without liquor Though a teetotaler I was forced to develop a tolerance for vodka so as not to cut myself from intellectual exchange My new talent came in handy one day when I shared a train compartment with a colonel in the rocket corps on his way to a Soviet missile base When I told him I was an American he pulled out a bottle of vodka from under his pillow filled an eightounce glass and gave it to me to gulp a toast to SovietAmerican friendship Luckily he poured another glass for himself and the bottle was finished Before he went to sleep he shook his head sadly and said You have no idea how much money we waste on these missiles No idea Its such a pity such a pity Like others who have spent any time in Russia I came back with some firm opinions There is a lot of bluff in what the Russians say about themselves and their society Intensely patriotic they are proud of the countrys bigness enjoy being Americas rival and compete with us in the only fields they can  world influence and the arms race On the other hand anybody who has seen the disorganization that characterizes the Soviet civilian economy cannot but wonder about the state of their military establishment A first step toward understanding the Russian colossus might be the realization that it is the most developed of the worlds underdeveloped nations and not  as it is usually put  the other way around The Russians are a tired people hoping for a better future and trying as best they can to live under very difficult circumstances in a world that puzzles them as much as they puzzle it
CANDIDATES FOR FAMILY COURT JUDGE DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/archives/candidates-for-family-court-judge-debate.html,FOUR of the five candidates for Family Court appeared last week at a meeting in White Plains sponsored by the Westchester County Womens Council The audience which included many whose work brings them in contact with the court questioned the candidates on a range of specific issues including educational workshops for men and women who batter their spouses and children orders of protection and the effect of a RighttoLife endorsement in abortion cases Two seats are to be filled in the November election The candidates who appeared were Family Court Judge Barbara L Kaiser a DemocratLiberal who is serving an interim term by appointment of Governor Carey Cheryl J Bradley DemocratLiberal John J Sherlock on the Republican and Conservative lines and Louis A Barone on the Republican Conservative and RighttoLife lines The fifth candidate Charles Mills who is running on a RighttoLife line said in a telephone conversation that he had not received an invitation to the debate Mandating educational workshops for batterers has been an option for judges since 1981 One questioner saying the program was underused asked how judges could be convinced to order the workshops and enforce contempt penalties on noshow batterers Mr Sherlock replied The program is beautiful but I dont know if a man can be ordered to attend or if that is within the discretion of the court and consistent with the law We must recognize his rights and not infringe on an individuals liberty Judge Kaiser agreed as an old civil libertarian She said that to compel a batterer to attend you must first prove the person had done the act charged otherwise it would be better if it was done voluntarily for the education to be effective Mr Barone said he would be reluctant to mandate education unless a crime was committed Mrs Bradley also deferred to legal safeguards in questioning an educational mandate whose constitutionality may not survive a challenge She suggested however that the judge could order psychiatric evaluation Jeanine Pirro chief of the domesticviolence prosecution unit of the District Attorneys office who was in the audience expressed disappointment that not one candidate would insist the respondant attend workshops or face contempt charges Respondant is the word used in Family Court for the defendant the plaintiff is called the petitioner One questioner asked how the candidates would treat a case of repeated assaults in which the accused person contributed to the delay of a permanent protection order by such tactics as neglecting to retain a lawyer promptly Mrs Bradley said I would have no problem with sending that to Criminal Court One man spoke of timeconsuming appearances in Family Court to deal with his wifes petitions concerning custody and visitation He asked how that could be prevented to save the courts time the costs and his continuous emotional involvement Mrs Bradley suggested that appointment of a law guardian to see to the best interests of the children might help to prevent such manipulation of the court by parents battling through children Judge Kaiser suggested arbitration as an alternative Mr Barone because of his acceptance of the RighttoLife endorsement was asked if a woman would get a fair hearing from him in an abortion case I dont encourage or discourage her decision he said It really doesnt bother me whatsoever In a later exchange on the question he said My own religious belief is something I cant impose on someone else Im not against RighttoLife and thats why I took the line After the meeting Vickie Stein chairman of the Family Violence Committee of the Womens Council and moderator of the meeting spoke about Mr Barone and the other RighttoLife candidates for state judicial office I believe that it is dangerous and improper for any judicial candidate to accept the RighttoLife endorsement she said because it is a singleissue party and judicial candidates are not supposed to campaign on issues Any judge who accepts that political line cannot approach a case with an open mind because he has a publicly acknowledged bias Another question concerned whether a single mother battered in a domestic situation should be allowed to choose Family Court a civil jurisdiction instead of Criminal Court No way said Mr Barone citing the overcrowding of the Family Court calendar Mrs Bradley disagreed Not only single women but also exspouses should be able to use Family Court and new legislation to this effect ought to be submitted and passed to insure this alternative Judge Kaiser although noting that New York State does not recognize commonlaw relationships said I dont take such a tight view on discretion concerning who can use Family Court and I would like to test the limits of that discretion An unmarried mother whose child is in danger already has the legal right to ask Family Court for an order of protection pointed out a member of the audience Virginia Knaplund a lawyer for Westchester Legal Services
NEW YORK POLL SHOWS STATE VOTERS AMBIVALENT ON BIG TAX CUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/nyregion/new-york-poll-shows-state-voters-ambivalent-on-big-tax-cuts.html,New York State voters consider themselves overtaxed but appear unwilling to reduce taxes sharply if such cuts would reduce the level of services provided by state government according to a New York Times Poll just taken The survey found that New Yorkers view state government as not spending enough in a number of areas and a substantial minority of the electorate would be willing to see taxes rise if the money could be targeted to particular areas especially aid to local schools This ambivalence about taxing and spending has so far been helpful to the campaign of the DemocraticLiberal candidate Lieut Gov Mario M Cumo Mr Cuomo has said he would like to cut taxes but believes that the 40 percent cut in income taxes proposed by his opponent Lewis E Lehrman would force major reductions in state aid to localities  and could lead to propertytax increases At one level Mr Lehrmans program clearly speaks to powerful antitax sentiments in the states electorate The survey found that 67 percent view state taxes as too high 52 Percent Back Large Tax Cuts Yet only 52 percent of the states voters said they favored large tax cuts and 40 were opposed And half the voters who supported large tax cuts said they would oppose them if the reductions would require cutbacks in essential services This reduced the hard core of tax cutters to onequarter of the states electorate The surveys findings on these and other questions are one indication why Mr Lehrmans seemingly popular proposals have not yet pushed him ahead of Mr Cuomo The Times survey showed Mr Cumo leading Mr Lehrman The poll found that voters were as ambivalent about spending increases as they were about tax cuts Fiftytwo percent said that the state provided too little assistance to local school districts only 3 percent thought the state was giving too much aid Fortyfour percent complained that there was too little state aid to local governments and only 9 percent thought there was too much assistance Yet these voters too had their doubts and they also showed that the electorate favors assistance to schools far more than it supports assistance to local governments 39 Percent for More School Aid Over all 39 percent of the states voters said they would still favor increasing aid to schools even though this would result in tax increases This position would correspond roughly to the one taken by Governor Carey earlier this year Mr Carey called for a penny increase in the state sales tax to increase state aid to school districts On the other hand only 25 percent of the voters would support increased assistance to local governments if tax increases would be required Local assistance and school aid account for 60 percent of the state budget which means that any Governor who hopes to make substantial cuts in state spending without hurting these popular programs would have to look for large cuts in the limited pool of money left over Most surveys have shown that voters favor cutting welfare a position Mr Lehrman has advocated But when The Times asked voters if they thought welfare payments in New York were too high too low or about the right amount only 24 percent said they were too high a fifth said they were too low and the rest thought welfare payments were at the right level or did not have a view If the word welfare is not mentioned  polls have shown a substantial hostility to welfare in the abstract and voters were asked their views about government aid to the poor 40 percent believed the government was doing too little for the poor only 14 percent believed it was doing too much And if the states political leaders ever do get around to cutting taxes the survey showed they would find a sharp division among taxpayers over which levies should be cut first Onethird of the voters interviewed felt that property taxes should be cut first nearly as many prefer cutting the sales tax while 24 percent support cutting the income tax Only 6 percent feel that business taxes should get priority Not surprisingly homeowners are more in favor of propertytax cuts than renters more surprising is that a fifth of the states renters would cut the property tax before the other levies On the face of it Mr Lehrmans plans to make large cuts in the income and sales taxes would appear popular But the survey suggests that Mr Cuomo could make considerable headway by showing that such cuts would require cuts in state aid which in turn could result in propertytax increases Divided About Westway The survey also showed that the states voters were sharply divided on two controversial issues the Westway project to replace the West Side Highway and Medicaid financing of abortions for the poor In New York City the survey found registered voters favored the Westway project by 53 percent to 29 percent The project also found favor in the suburbs by 51 percent to 25 percent A majority of upstate voters had no opinion on the project but those who did split 34 percent to 11 percent against the Westway Thus the project found favor statewide from 38 percent of the voters and was opposed by 29 percent The remainder had no opinion The survey found voters sharply split on whether the government should pay for the abortions of women who cannot afford them Fortyeight percent favored Medicaid abortion financing and 46 percent opposed it Catholics opposed Medicaid abortion financing by 56 percent to 38 percent Protestants split evenly with 47 percent favoring it and 47 percent opposed Jewish voters strongly favored Medicaid abortion financing 78 percent to 19 percent The survey also found that upperincome respondents favored state financing of abortions and that lower income voters were opposed Finally the survey shed some light on the conflicts over the last year between Governor Carey and the State Legislature Among voters likely to cast ballots next month only 27 percent approved of the way Mr Carey was handling his job while 61 percent disapproved The Legislatures rating was slightly higher 35 percent of the likely voters approved the way the Legislature was handling its job 39 percent disapproved and 26 percent had no opinion HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED The poll was based on telephone interviews conducted from Oct 10 through 16 with 1941 adults throughout New York State Of this total 1264 said they were registered voters The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the state for each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by randomly selecting digits thus permitting access to listed and unlisted residential numbers The results have been weighted to account for household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to race sex age and education In theory it can be said that in 95 cases out of 100 the results based on the entire sample are no more than 3 percentage points above or below what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult New York State residents The error for subgroups is larger depending on the number of sample cases in the subgroup The theoretical errors do not take in account a margin of additional error resulting from the various practical difficulties in taking any survey of public opinion Assisting The New York Times in its 1982 survey coverage is Dr Irving Crespi of Irving Crespi and Associates a survey consulting concern
HOW'S HE DOING?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/books/how-s-he-doing.html,THE REAGAN EXPERIMENT Edited by John L Palmer and Isabel V Sawhill 530 pp Washington DC The Urban Institute Press Cloth 2995 Paper 1295 ETERNAL vigilance may be the price of liberty but it has other costs as well We can subject government to so intense a scrutiny that we no longer see its larger directions and purposes Still this is the American way So President Reagan had hardly taken office when the Urban Institute a Washington think tank decided that his Administration would need unblinking attention After all his campaign promised nothing less ambitious than what this book calls a counterrevolution If the New Deal would not be repealed it would at least be put on a very stringent diet To monitor this experiment  without precedent the Urban Institute secured 6 million in foundation funds and took on a team of 27 analysts backed by a research staff and a 19member panel of advisers The result is The Reagan Experiment announced as a rigorous and impartial assessment of the programs and policies of the man Americans elected two years ago The titles of the chapters are neutral to a fault Budget Policy Social Services The State and Local Sector By my count there are exactly 100 tables with data from the Office of Management and Budget the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers The editors acknowledge that some areas  defense foreign affairs the environment  get only marginal attention Nor are abortion school prayers and other issues touched on A second volume is promised for 1984 however The Reagan Revolution takes the Presidents rhetoric very seriously We are reminded of his 1980 campaign promises to cut taxes balance the budget and give more money to the military inflation would be halved and we could expect a similar reduction in the 74 percent unemployment rate that was President Carters legacy Supplyside economics supplemented by monetary policy would ensure the early success of this allinclusive program The Urban Institutes analysts also tell us what most of us already know Instead of improving the general economic picture has grown steadily worse The essays in this book provide a daybyday chronicle of targets and tradeoffs as expressed by data from official Washington But from another standpoint the Reagan experiment can be said to be working The book cites cuts in social programs especially those aimed at aiding disadvantaged citizens Following the Presidents directives there is to be less money for infant immunization nursinghome inspections and nutrition programs for lowincome pregnant women Here the Urban Institute is on familiar terrain According to its research in area after area less qualified people are being hired staff training is being postponed and reduction in the quality of care is inevitable Meanwhile over at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fewer studies are being done on potential car defects including braking requirements and the drivers field of vision It is not altogether clear for whom this volume billed as nonpartisan  is intended Its style tends toward the special patois of applied social science Nor is it easy to follow the exposition if you cannot identify SEOG NDSL CWS BEOG GSL and MISAA The world according to the Urban Institute seems composed of paper and printouts The book offers little evidence empirical or otherwise that the 27 analysts ever left their cubicles Moreover to refer to the Administration as an experiment sounds just a little condescending as if the President must remain on probation until credentialed professionals certify his status What the authors mean of course is that Ronald Reagan rejects theories and institutions with which they are allied and that they call his outlook counterrevolutionary implies that it conflicts with an accepted consensus on how America should run In fact what the Reagan Presidency is seeking to accomplish is very much in the American grain It begins with the premise that ours is a capitalist country that our overall wellbeing depends on the prosperity only business can create That is what supplyside economics is essentially about The people whom government must encourage are those who supply the marketplace with services and goods They must be allowed to invest and innovate take risks and make money for their vigor and ambition builds the nations wealth Equally important only if their enterprises flourish will employment be available for everyone who wants it Hence their antipathy to regulations and controls The issue is less economic cost than constraint by bureaucratic rules Of course car brakes ought to work But must the torsion of each screw be precisely specified Ronald Reagans is very much a business Administration and that prospect was not concealed from the voters when they went to the polls The Reagan program the Urban Institute also asserts marks a retreat from egalitarian values that had attracted growing and often bipartisan support over the past 20 years What the authors do not consider is that this President has a mandate to effect some serious changes The welfare state has made too many people improvident and indolent Take that nutrition program for lowincome mothers Let us assume as we may that some are adolescent girls who plan to have and keep their babies While liberals would lavish these teenage mothers with services including generous stipends the Reagan response is that the very availability of these benefits encourages youthful pregnancies and the poverty that follows The Urban Institutes own posture comes across in discussion of Washingtons dealings with the states Previous Administrations we are told pursued a constructive partnership based on a cooperative model Now we have antagonism evidenced by reduced Federal funding and sterner standards for food stamps and other services These controls the analysts point out appear to contradict the Administrations interest in regulatory relief Nor are there signs that the states will pick up the tab for various programs as Federal money ebbs But the President knows that the states have usually taken a dim view of socalled human services Less cash from Washington will allow them to define their own priorities and some might see that approach as being in a cooperative spirit Nowhere in The Reagan Experiment is there space for a rendering of the Administrations intentions The book can be said to be nonpartisan in that the Urban Institutes advisory board has some Republican members But partisanship can take other forms It is clear that the volume has an implicit commitment to what may be called the administrative state an ideological edifice that has grown in myriad directions over the last half century In addition to being very expensive this state is based on presumptions of knowledge about social functioning Hence the disadvantaged and community development there are many similar phrases must be supported by programs and funding A large segment of the middle class now staffs this state and it has created a mode of discourse that is difficult to challenge How can anyone oppose improved nutrition for lowincome mothers Ronald Reagans promise was to dismantle this state Part of his Administrations problem is that it lacks an analytic apparatus comparable to that wielded by bodies like the Urban Institute In an age of mathematical models and the professionalizing of compassion his people who are very different by temperament and training from the supporters of the administrative state come across as McGuffey Reader moralists Whether we will ever again see what American capitalism can do is at this point uncertain But if that system cannot work we had better have something nearly as good to put in its place
NATION'S VOTERS TO DECIDE HIGHEST NUMBER; OF BALLOT PROPOSITIONS IN 50 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/us/nation-s-voters-to-decide-highest-number-of-ballot-propositions-in-50-years.html,A new national wave of statewide ballot propositions the most since 1932 will be decided in the Nov 2 elections Most were submitted by liberal rather than conservative groups a sharp reversal from the recent past The voterinitiated propositions for lower taxes and spending limits on state and local governments that were predominant in the late 1970s have been overshadowed this year by a variety of proposals that environmentalists consumer and antinuclear groups placed on the ballot either through voter petitions or through state legislatures In addition to the advisory petitions calling for a freeze on nuclear weapons that are on the ballot in nine states their proposals include curbs on utilities and nuclear energy requirements for land preservation and for a bottle deposit to prevent litter creation of special zones to encourage rebuilding of blighted neighborhoods tax increases or new assistance for schools and transportation political reforms and a hotly contested gun control measure in California On the conservative side there are measures to limit taxes although fewer than in past years In addition there are proposals to impose the death penalty for certain crimes to reaffirm the right to keep and bear arms and to take a variety of other actions such as ending land use planning in Oregon or prohibiting the use of state funds for abortions in Alaska But these are far outnumbered by the measures promoted by the activist citizen groups on the left that have sprung up in recent years to effect change through lobbying legal action and direct votes on issues Indicator of Voter Sentiment Some authorities say they believe the vote on the ballot proposals may be a better indicator than the Congressional elections of whether voter sentiment is swinging back toward the left after almost two years under the conservative government of President Reagan The really significant question as the Nov 2 ballot approaches is whether or not American voters are on the verge of moving to the left in their verdicts on ballot questions said Patrick B McGuigan editor of Initiative and Referendum Report published by the Free Congress Foundation a conservative research organization Mr McGuigan acknowledged that the most significant development in the past two years has been a dramatic increase in the effectiveness professionalism and credibility of the liberal campaigns in placing issues on the ballot David D Schmidt editor of The Initiative News Report an independent publication said the content and number of this years ballot proposals constituted a definite swing to the left and were all the more impressive because they were accompanied by the signatures of at least 16 million voters 53 Proposals From Petitions In the 23 states that permit ballot propositions initiated by citizen petition 53 propositions gained the required number of signatures and survived court challenges to qualify for the ballot In all states Mr McGuigan counted 230 referendums that the legislatures put on the ballot many of them proposing minor revisions in state law but a significant number of them issues pushed by citizens groups Some states including New York and Connecticut have no major proposals on the ballot this year In addition to statewide proposals a number of local jurisdictions are to vote on a variety of questions In Ohio for example 34 school districts acting under a new state law have put proposals on the ballot to increase the income tax to help pay for schools And in Berkeley Calif citizens will vote on an initiative to ban the use of electroshock therapy used to treat depression Many of the statewide propositions are being intensely debated with large sums being spent on the campaigns for or against them particularly on utility curbs the bottle deposit proposals and gun control Spending on just two propositions Californias pistol control and bottle proposals has already passed 10 million Mr Schmidt said Initiatives Peaked in 1914 Use of the voterinitiated referendum reached its peak in 1914 as a result of the Progressive political movement that swept the country after the turn of the century It declined when the states began requiring more signatures to put propositions on the ballot It rose again in the Depression of the 1930s when there was widespread citizen unrest and in the 1970s when there was growing distrust of representative government Mr Schmidt said one reason for the initiative boom this year was the lightning rod effect of controversial officials such as Mr Reagan and Interior Secretary James G Watt They arouse intense opposition from their critics who being out of power in the nations capital are bringing their case directly before the people with ballot initiatives he said It is no surprise that environmentalists who have sponsored initiatives in the past decade have taken the initiative route as never before in 1982 Most of the states that permit initiatives are in the West only six east of the Mississippi River do so Maine Massachusetts Florida Illinois Ohio and Michigan But citizens of some states can sometimes accomplish the same results by persuading the Legislature to put a particular issue to a public vote Thus a number of controversial proposals are on the ballot this year in states that do not permit initiatives Following are some of the major proposals to be decided Nov 2 Nuclear Weapons Citizens in Massachusetts California Arizona Montana Michigan Oregon New Jersey Rhode Island and North Dakota and the District of Columbia will vote on the proposal that has been approved by hundreds of local governing bodies across the country to urge a bilateral verifiable halt to production deployment and testing of nuclear weapons This years freeze votes Mr McGuigan said represent the first instance in which voters in nine states have directly decided upon essentially the same question and thus is as close to a national referendum as the United States has experienced In addition Colorado voters will decide on a proposition to establish a fund to begin converting the Rocky Flats nuclear weapon site near Boulder to peaceful uses Utilities A popular assault on utilities is reflected in some of the initiatives In two states Michigan and Ohio public service commissions would be made elective rather than appointive which advocates say would give the public a better opportunity to control high rates The controversy in Michigan was further heated by two other propositions one to restrict utilities from automatically passing on to customers the higher costs of fuel and other expenses and the second a less severe alternative against passthroughs that was drafted by the Legislature Utilities in the state have spent more than 2 million to try to defeat the two more restrictive of the three measures In Missouri and Nevada ballot proposals would create utility consumer advocacy agencies to oppose rate increases and other practices before state regulatory agencies Nuclear Power In a highly publicized wellfinanced campaign Maine voters are being asked once again to vote to shut down the states only nuclear power plant Old Maine Yankee at Bailey Point The 1980 proposal which called for an immediate shutdown was defeated by a wide margin The current proposal would close it by 1987 In Massachusetts a heated contest is under way over a proposal to require that any new nuclear plant or radioactive waste disposal site be subject to approval by the people in a referendum Conservation Four states Arizona California Colorado and Washington would impose a minimum 5cent deposit on all soft drink and beer containers sold within those states But Massachusetts residents will vote on a proposition to repeal a bottle bill enacted by the Legislature In Arizona the Legislature over Gov Bruce Babbitts veto approved a Sagebrush Rebellion law that would have the state join other Western states in asserting claims to Federal lands Environmentalists however drafted a ballot initiative to nullify the law So the dispute that has been simmering in the West for many months will now go to the public vote The question will also be decided in Alaska but there a Tundra Rebellion measure on the ballot proposes that the state assert claims to Federal land The votes are likely to provide only a gauge for public opinion on the question In California a proposition to give the state more control of water resources a measure sponsored by environmentalists is under heavy attack Taxes The tax revolt has not yet spent all its fury In Oregon for example a proposed constitutional amendment that is almost identical to Californias Proposition 13 of 1978 which drastically reduced property taxes is on the ballot again after being rejected in the past But most tax measures now take another approach Mr McGuigan counted nine that would increase taxes or shift the tax burden to business An initiative in Washington would abolish the sales tax on food and would tax business profits rather than gross receipts A proposal in Missouri would raise the sales tax by 1 percent with half the proceeds going to schools and the other half used to lower property taxes Arizona and South Carolina measures would offer tax exemptions for businesses locating in enterprise zones in deteriorating neighborhoods Crime and Justice Californias proposal to ban pistols has attracted wide attention with advocates saying its approval would signal an important breakthrough in the antigun drive But New Hampshire and Nevada have proposals that affirm the right of citizens to bear arms Several other measures are aimed at harsher punishment for criminals and suspects In addition to a Massachusetts proposal to impose the death penalty for certain crimes an Arizona proposal would prohibit bail for suspects in some felony cases a Missouri referendum would abolish the requirement that the State Supreme Court review every conviction resulting in life imprisonment and a Michigan initiative would slow layoffs of police due to budget deficits Business Rules A number of restrictions on businesses placed on the ballots by consumer groups are similar to those proposed in the Depression A State of Washington plan would limit interest on credit card and installment purchases to 12 percent a Nebraska proposal would prohibit nonfamily corporations from acquiring farmland a Michigan initiative would restrict foreclosures on homes and a Maine proposal would end milk price controls Political Reform Struggles over redrawing Congressional and legislative districts after the 1980 census gave rise to efforts to take some of the redistricting power away from the Legislatures In California for example an initiative would provide for reapportionment by a commission or the State Supreme Court and in Missouri more power would be invested in redistricting commissions working with the Legislature

MRS. LEHRMAN AND MRS. CUOMO: NEW LIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/25/style/mrs-lehrman-and-mrs-cuomo-new-lives.html,It was teatime in the living room of the Park Avenue apartment of Lewis and Louise Lehrman Sunlight touched the pale green walls hung with French and American Impressionist paintings and a breeze ruffled the draperies The five Lehrman children home from school were laughing and playing at one end of the vast apartment decorated by ParishHadley while at the other end the cook was preparing dinner In the midst of this domestic idyll Mrs Lehrman was sitting on a sofa her hands folded talking about one of her two favorite subjects the children when a fastmoving figure in a navy blue suit and red suspenders shot past the doorway Mrs Lehrman seemed surprised by the sudden appearance of her husband who is the RepublicanConservative candidate for Governor and her other favorite subject Why hi love she called Hi sweetheart he replied A rare free hour had turned up on the candidates schedule he explained so he was home for a run in the park Mrs Lehrman smiled and Mr Lehrman disappeared into the back of the apartment to see the children and change into shorts Running Since Winter Politically speaking Mr Lehrman a millionaire businessman has been running since early last winter His wife has been sitting tight tending to their four sons and a daughter aged 3 to 13 years the family also has an estate in Greenwich Conn and a farm in Mechanicsburg Pa During the primary when it looked as though the Democratic nominee would be Mayor Koch a bigcity bachelor the Lehrman family made an upstate campaign swing the candidates suspenders flashing at parades and county fairs Then school opened and the surprise winner of the Democratic primary turned out to be Mario M Cuomo another father of five and except for the last two days of the campaign the childrens politicking will be confined to jogging through their fathers 30second commercials Oh well be away with Daddy on Halloween Mrs Lehrman told Eliza 7 when she picked her up from school at the bus stop Eliza looked crushed until her mother suggested that she trick or treat on the plane By her own admission Mrs Lehrman is still getting used to her sudden role as a political wife Im perfectly happy to meet people but Im not comfortable giving a speech in front of a crowd That doesnt mean that Im any less interested or less involved or that I dont think Lew should be Governor I know it would mean a major disruption of our lives for him to do this but I feel very strongly that he should do it The people of New York deserve him Professional Mother In the role of professional mother as she put it Mrs Lehrman seems altogether comfortable judging by her performance during a recent interview It was interrupted from time to time as children drifted home from school to report on the days events at showandtell football scrimmage and piano practice You have to be there to get the feedback on the spot Mrs Lehrman maintained after Peter 3 described his day in nursery school If you wait until dinnertime its gone out of their heads Although the Lehrmans employ a fulltime governess Mrs Lehrman considers herself a fulltime mother Saying I didnt have five children so I could hand them over to someone else to raise she voiced concern about the numbers of mothers of young children who work when they could afford to stay home Many choose not to and I think thats too bad she said with a sigh Repeatedly during the interview Mrs Lehrman acknowledged that some of her views might be seen as oldfashioned unpopular or unpolitical She said for example that she and her husband oppose abortion and that many of their friends disagree with them Lews not for abortion but he doesnt feel he should dictate to people one way or another she said adding however that her husband is on record against the use of state funds for abortions for poor women The television set is another area where the Lehrmans sometimes find themselves at odds with other families Except for special events such as the World Series or a rocket launching the children watch no television on weekdays  not even scenes of their campaigning father on the evening news Cable television is off limits at all times because of the nudity Mrs Lehrman explained adding that even the permissible Saturday cartoons left the children looking drugged We encourage homework here  she said and reading for 15 minutes before bedtime Mrs Lehrmans community work revolves almost entirely around one of the four private schools the children attend I dont mean to sound selfless  I really enjoy it she said as she ticked off some of her varied tasks a delegate to the Parents League of New York a member of the safety patrol that shepherds children home from school and a class mother among others The only thing missing was brownies for the school sale Oh Ive brought brownies she said with a light laugh and needlepoint and knitted things to the Christmas sale The other day Mrs Lehrman was hostess at the Knickerbocker Dancing Class which meets at the Cosmopolitan Club No one was surprised that in the midst of the campaign she was there to shake the childrens hands said an acquaintance on the same dinnerparty circuit as the Lehrmans Her background is very white glove Louise Stillman Lehrman who is 42 years old is the daughter of Charles Latimer Stillman retired chairman of the finance committee and former executive of Time Inc and of Frances Johnson Albano the Stillmans were divorced when Louise was 10 Mrs Lehrman is an alumna of the Brearley School the Madeira School in Greenway Va and the Columbia University School of General Studies In 1958 she made her debut at the Debutante Ball of the New York Junior League and at a small dinner dance at the River Club Services in Both Faiths It was there eight years later that she married Lewis Edward Lehrman in a ceremony performed by a Civil Court judge Theirs is a mixed marriage he is Jewish and she is an Episcopalian The children have attended services of both faiths Mrs Lehrman said and will choose their religion when they are older Mrs Lehrman says that religion has never been an issue in our house It became a campaign issue last week when Mr Lehrman was questioned about his Jewish identity at a meeting of the New York Board of Rabbis This did not seem to have ruffled his wife She shook her head and said Its difficult for people to understand When you dont go to church every Sunday or to the synagogue every week and your children dont go to Sunday school its hard to say that youre religious people But in fact we both have a strong sense of values and a lot of that comes from our religious heritage
A.C.L.U. SEES ADMINISTRATION AS A DANGER TO CIVIL LIBERTIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/25/us/aclu-sees-administration-as-a-danger-to-civil-liberties.html,The head of the American Civil Liberties Union accused the Reagan Administration today of ideological opposition to civil liberties and said that the Administration and its supporters in Congress had been responsible for the most dangerous threats to civil liberties in recent years Ira Glasser the American Civil Liberties Unions executive director made the accusations in an introduction to a 60page report that the organization issued today While the report Civil Liberties in Reagans America reviewed what it characterized as threats to civil liberties by school boards and local and state governments it reserved its harshest criticism for the White House and Congress Earlier Dangers Recalled Mr Glasser said that in some ways the Reagan Administration posed a greater danger to civil liberties than did either Senator Joseph R McCarthy or President Richard M Nixon Those men he said were not ideologically committed to making fundamental changes in our legal structure They had no particular theory of government They were driven by personal ambition and to be sure they did not hesitate to sweep the Bill of Rights aside when it was an obstacle Mr Glasser continued But for this Administration the erosion of the Bill of Rights seems to be a primary goal not a side effect This Administration seeks to make structural changes in our system of government that should they succeed will not be easy to overcome once their time in office passes Mr Glasser singled out the Administrations support of legislative efforts to strip the Federal courts of their jurisdiction to enforce an array of constitutional rights If such bills pass he said the Federal courts will be terribly weakened The courts will no longer be insulated from politics they will become the tool of whoever is in power Accusations From the Start The ACLU is a 62yearold lobbying and litigating organization concerned with protecting individual rights as outlined by the Constitution and statute law Its relations with the Reagan Administration have been strained since the early days of the Presidents term In May of last year Edwin Meese 3d President Reagans counselor made a speech in which he accused the Civil Liberties Union of being part of a criminals lobby that had made the job of law enforcement more difficult The tone of todays report including Mr Glassers introduction was reminiscent of the ACLUs stance toward the Nixon White House One typical brochure for recruiting new members in those days began The NixonAgnewMitchell Administration is engaged in a concerted attack on American liberties The report today reviewed the status of civil liberties in 20 categories including criminal justice national security political dissent abortion and womens rights Hostility to Women Charged One of the principal undercurrents in Reagans America is a hostility toward women the report said which is masked as a nostalgic demand for a way of life based on traditional family values The tradition referred to is the nostalgic family model of the 1950s and of fundamentalist Christian doctrine the report added a family dominated by the husand as provider and defender in which the womans role is reduced to that of mother and minister to the needs of the husband
NUCLEAR ARMS: A NEW CATHOLIC CONCERN; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/us/nuclear-arms-a-new-catholic-concern-news-analysis.html,Voicing urgency and firmness the Committee on War and Peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has offered a proposed pastoral letter on nuclear weapons that places concern for arms reduction at the heart of the churchs social ministry The draft statement to be debated by the full conference at a meeting next month draws on biblical teachings papal pronouncements and liturgical practices to support its central theological contention that Catholics must give utmost attention to achieving peace and the abolition of nuclear arms Alarm over nuclear weapons has recently risen sharply in the church Among the key convictions mirrored strongly in the draft statement is that the issue is integrally linked to a cluster of moral priorities such as opposition to abortion that follow from a commitment to the principle of the sacredness of life While some bishops have spoken out for a condemnation of nuclear arms many others have taken more moderate positions and a few have expressed adamant reservations about moving in a more antinuclear direction The committee has strived to give the bishops a platform on which they can stand together without having to agree totally In elaborating on this theme the bishops committee spotlights several aspects of Christian tradition that have often been overlooked or regarded as unrelated to the everyday lives of Catholics Under this statement issues of war and peace can no longer be considered peripheral Explanation of Spiritual Basis Underlying the statements specific recommendations is an extensive explanation of the spiritual foundations on which it rests Peace is a gift of God the bishops say and it is attained through acceptance of Jesus loving salvation Only with repentance and grace can Christians achieve peaceful aims Reducing violence cannot be a matter only for bishops and church strategists but must concern every communicant because the peril is so great The bishops bring together the diverse emphases on peace in the churchs life in a manner that underscores a unified and powerful teaching They note for instance that an exchange of a sign of peace usually a handshake or embrace enters into every celebration of the mass To stress the importance of the pursuit of peace for each person the bishops further counsel Catholics to seek forgiveness through the rite of penance if they have failed to fulfill this basic mandate Seeking an end to the arms race is shifted to the core of responsibilities and its neglect is therefore believed to be sinful Questions of Conscience With individual responsibilities still in mind the bishops go on to address the situations faced by many Catholics involved in questions of conscience including workers in military plants the military and nuclear research The approach is not to scold or forbid any of these activities as such but to ask participants to keep the churchs teachings on war and peace in mind in forming their own consciences Focus on the churchs traditional pacifism and nonviolence likewise becomes an important element that helps shape the statements entire tone and purpose In effect the statement places the burden on those who would use any tool of force It presses Catholics to forswear many forms of violence As in the case of the bishops recent opposition to all military aid to El Salvador against the wishes of the Reagan Administration the draft statement shows the hierarchys increasing willingness to break with official United States Government policy It is another sign of a church once made up mostly of immigrants and subject to nativist attacks no longer pressured to prove its patriotism by uncritically accepting military and foreign policy On the contrary the draft statement reflects a growing perception among the bishops that they must speak to the largest society as a principled minority Progress on Set of Principles If their fellow bishops accept the formulation given in the draft proposal the hierarchy will have gone far in asserting a consensus that not only condemns nuclear war rejects first strike strategy and supports a bilateral nuclear freeze but also takes definite steps as a body of Christians to lay down a set of principles that runs counter to much prevailing conventional thinking We readily recognize that we live in a world that is becoming increasingly estranged from Christian values the draft statement says In order to remain a Christian one must take a resolute stand against the commonly accepted axioms of the world The strongest theological feature of this critical stance is that the demand for peace must realistically be balanced by the reality of a sinful world Visions of utopia are set aside in favor of standards that recognize the evil intentions of nations The bishops refrain from drawing many absolute conclusions upholding the traditional teaching that full peace can be attained only through God The bishops add that they know that at times efforts to pursue both peace and justice are intentioned and the struggle for justice may threaten certain forms of peace With that delicate balance the committee hopes to move the bishops in a new direction
Serving the Term,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/opinion/serving-the-term.html,There is a 13yearold in Grand Rapids Mich who is pregnant by a boy of the same age A ward of the court she has asked for an abortion The court in the person of Probate Judge Randall Hekman has refused permission I find it impossible Judge Hekman says not to give regard for this totally innocent and defenseless creature that is within the womb of this lady Given the judges concern for the innocent and defenseless one is puzzled that it doesnt extend to the 13yearold girl Or does sexual precocity imply an irrevocable loss of innocence an access to knowledge that renders one if not quite grown up no longer young Maybe being pregnant makes it impossible for someone to be thought of as a kid any longer Maybe thats why the judge called this child a lady As for defenselessness  doesnt being a ward of the court because of neglect as is this girl constitute official proof of hers Judge Hekman has a counterpart in another Michigan judge who last year refused to allow an abortion for an 11yearold ward of the court whose pregnancy resulted from rape That girls baby is now also a ward of the court her 12yearold mother having been found unable to provide for her emotional wellbeing In both cases Judge Hekman and his fellow in Kalamazoo are strictly speaking simply making decisions So why does it look like what theyre really doing is handing out sentences
"WASHINGTON; CHURCH, STATE AND THE BOMB",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/opinion/washington-church-state-and-the-bomb.html,In next weeks Congressional elections the voters in nine states will be asked to pass judgment on the nuclear arms race But while most of them will probably come out for freezing the development of these weapons of mass destruction this question has almost vanished as a major issue in the election The Reagan Administration opposes a nuclear freeze on the ground that it would not be in the national interest and has asked in effect Do you want to help the Russians This question has muted the antinuclear movement and the Administration is now inclined to believe that the question will go away Even so wise an observer as Ben J Wattenberg has concluded that the antinuclear demonstrations like the antidraft and Equal Rights Amendment marches of last spring will really have little if any effect on next weeks election He is undoubtedly right in the short run and while this consoles the Reagan Administration this is one of those elemental issues that wont go away Other forces in our national life are insisting that the control of nuclear weapons is too serious to be left to the politicians or to governments For example the Committee on War and Peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops often regarded as a militant antiCommunist organization has just drafted a proposed pastoral letter arguing that Catholics must pay the utmost attention to achieving peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons It insists that if the Catholic conscience believes in the sacredness of life for example in its opposition to abortion it cannot ignore the possible use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations It goes beyond that and in an astonishing challenge to the power of the state even suggests that Catholics have a moral obligation to consider as a matter of Christian conscience whether they should cooperate in the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons In this proposed message to the Catholic constituency the bishops even suggest that indifference to the threat of nuclear weapons is sinful We readily recognize they say that we live in a world that is becoming increasingly estranged from Christian values In order to remain a Christian one must take a resolute stand against the commonly accepted axioms of the world There are also other organizations in Washington not religious but secular that are monitoring the nuclear arms race and they also have something to say For example theres a group in the Washington suburbs monitoring world military and social expenditures Its latest report says the following  The worlds stockpile of nuclear weapons is now equivalent to 16 billion tons of TNT In World War II three million tons of munitions were expended and between 40 million and 50 million people died  The US Government is now spending a minimum of 45 billion a year on a Rapid Deployment Force to protect its vital interests in Middle East oil as opposed to 400 million for research on renewable energy resources as alternatives to oil  In 24 countries food consumption averages 30 to 50 percent above requirements in 25 countries the average is 10 to 30 percent below requirements The richest fifth of the worlds population has 71 percent of the worlds product the poorest fifth has 2 percent  In 32 countries governments spend more for military purposes than for education and health care combined These issues are not really being debated in this election Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts has tried to argue the nuclear freeze issue without much attention or success His main competitor for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1984 former Vice President Mondale has been concentrating on the labor vote and sounding vaguely protectionist President Reagan has been flying around the country calling on everybody to stay the course without saying anything about the major issue of nuclear arms control But outside politics other voices are trying to be heard We seek the Catholic bishops said to encourage a public attitude which sets stringent limits on the kind of actions our Government will take on nuclear policy in our name We believe religious leaders have a task in concert with public officials analysts private organizations and the media to set the limits beyond which our military policy should not move in word or action These voices are not being heard very much in the present election but they are touching deeper parts of the American mind and they will probably continue to be heard long after the votes in next weeks election are counted

REAGAN ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF STRESSING ECONOMIC FEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/us/reagan-accuses-democrats-of-stressing-economic-fear.html,President Reagan pressing to protect his Congressional coalition in the dwindling days of the campaign accused his critics today of playing with peoples fears about the economy and turning the nightly television news shows into the network evening blues Repeatedly expressing concern that the political season will serve to scare people and subvert recovery Mr Reagan journeyed to this friendly state a keystone in his own Presidential victory to plead for a little more time to fix the one remaining problem the 40year record tide of unemployment The President was hailed repeatedly His own smile beamed from a downtown billboard Bluegrass music gave way to a brassy thumping version of Hail to the Chief when Mr Reagan arrived before an overflow crowd at the Raleigh Civic Center His satisfiedlooking host was Senator Jesse Helms the conservative Republican who engineered a crucial primary victory here for Mr Reagan in 1976 one that gave him impetus for the 1980 drive A great turning point of my life the President said in an aside that was a strong tribute to Senator Helms But of necessity Mr Reagan had to focus on the dominant political issue of the economy rather than the Senators cherished array of social issues Strong Wings on Weary Hearts The President alternated between predictions of a new season of hope for the economy and lambastings of Democrats who feel they may be able to crack his Congressional coalition in the elections Tuesday We will put strong wings on weary hearts he told the enthusiastic Republican rally contending that he could see the end of the long terrible night of economic hardship At the same time he indicated sensitivity to the compassion issue being stressed by Congressional Democrats  the accusation that the Reagan economic program has been tailored for the rich and the powerful Its about time that the people who blow so much smoke about compassion started showing some real compassion for the people who pay this countrys bills Mr Reagan said Denouncing the Democrats for leaving the nation with what he called an an economic monster the President said that if he must bear the blame for unemployment he would also take credit for other statistics showing economic improvement He offered qualified acceptance of the oppositions contention that the economy was now on its knees WellPlanned Campaign Day Thats quite an improvement he said because two years ago it was flat on its back The crowd laughed and applauded and obviously enjoyed a wellplanned campaign day filled with patriotic trappings including the presenting of the Medal of Freedom to Kate Smith the singer identified with God Bless America White House political aides have been poring over almost daily political readings aimed at the shifting nuances of voter attitude as Tuesday approaches This research appeared to underlie at least two points in Mr Reagans speech One was his continuing need to combat the compassion issue The other was a new hint of resentment of the evening television news shows as Election Day approaches and stories focused on the mixed economic news particularly the latest unemployment rate of 101 percent Our critics are playing with peoples fears trying to scare them into believing that things will get worse so their own political fortunes will get better the President said But the picture of fear and despair that they paint on the network evening blues is a picture of where America was not where shes going Contrary to the early campaign hopes of White House strategists Mr Reagans final week on the campaign circuit featured only the smallest singlesentence mention of the social issues abortion and school prayer Normally such topics might galvanize politics in this conservative bastion that is part of the rightwing realm of Senator Helms Instead the Presidents speech reflected how dominant the economic issue has become and how yoked are his need for popular confidence in the economy and something other than a clear rebuff at the polls next Tuesday Favorable Economic Data Cited This great country of ours is ready to move again Mr Reagan said And its time others stopped trying to scare people and subvert recovery Once again as he does at every campaign stop the President listed favorable economic data beginning with falling interest and inflation rates Today he stressed the newest data showing inflation shrinking further below 5 percent thus far in 1982 But he did not mention Mondays drop in stock market prices ignoring a marketplace that he was hailing in speeches two weeks ago as evidence of recovery Before he left the White House however he fielded a question on this subject and argued that the market was leveling but remained an up market Slowly surely confidence is being restored Mr Reagan contended before the rally And America will lead the world out of this worldwide recession

AT THE MOVIES; Stacy Keach on directing one's destiny.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/29/arts/at-the-movies-stacy-keach-on-directing-one-s-destiny.html,STACY KEACH is one of those actors who seem to work at will In every medium December will bring him to the big screen in That Championship Season and next month will see him on television in The Blue and the Gray adapted from Bruce Cattons work about the Civil War In The Blue and the Gray Mr Keach plays a fictional character based on fact he explains Hes Lincolns bodyguard a Union officer an Army scout and a bit of a spy He believes its the best part hes ever had and he almost didnt get it An irony he says Last year I was on the road with Barnum We opened in New Orleans played three weeks went on to the Kennedy Center in Washington played six weeks then went to Detroit where we died Nobody in Detroit could afford to go to the theater It was very sad to me but as a result of Barnum closing I was able to do The Blue and the Gray  Mr Keach likes to come back to the stage once a year though during one long period in the 1970s he stayed away I had done a very successful Hamlet in New York he says and I thought Ill do it in California Sort of hometown boy comes back from the wars Well it was a different production it didnt work out and I was disappointed so I sort of sat on my hands for four years after that When I finally went back and did Cyrano  in Long Beach with Stefanie Powers it was wonderful and I realized how important it was to me In the movies Mr Keach says that having made The Long Riders was a turning point for him and for his brother The Long Riders was a film written by Stacy and James Keach produced by Tim Zinnemann and the Keach brothers and starring the Keaches as Frank and Jesse James I realize now Mr Keach says that you cant rely on other people to come to you all the time and say Have I got a part for you Youve got to go to a producer and say Have I got a part for me I think its important to produce direct write do as much as you can because that way an actor can control his destiny a little more At 41 Mr Keachs feelings about being an actor are different from what they were at 21 I took to acting like a duck to water he says but not to early success I didnt know how to react to the press I was only comfortable when I was behind a character Now having achieved a certain amount of satisfaction and also a certain amount of acceptance of the frustrations and rejections I think I have a much clearer perspective about who I am Since hes been covered with awards  Obie awards Drama Desk awards Tony nominations New York Critics Poll awards  it seems fair to inquire whether he ever got a bad review Sure he says In facthe is very proud of his bad reviews from one famously nasty critic Mr Keach remembered He once said of me What Stacy Keach lacks in spirit he makes up for with spirit gum  In the movie version of That Championship Season Mr Keach is the guy who tells Bruce Dern that Mr Derns wife has been having an affair with Paul Sorvino The character he plays is not altogether nice but Mr Keach likes him You have to commit yourself to find the virtue in a character he says You cant play a negative point of view So Im very defensive about him He chuckles I think hes a wonderful person Something else Mr Keach thinks is wonderful is that his place at Malibu Calif is still standing after the fires that tore through the area two weeks ago We live in a continual disaster movie out there Terry Jean Moore And Her Struggles Terry Jean Moores arm is in a cast because Precious Agnes Moore sat on it Precious is only 3 12 years old but she got all excited during a ride at Disneyworld and she bounced down crack on her mothers arm and that was that It was simply the latest in the series of accidents that constitute the life of Terry Jean Moore In 1977 when she was 21 she was arrested in Orlando Fla for stealing 5 and sent to jail for seven years At Broward Correctional Institution she became pregnant by a guard and refused to identify the father or to have an abortion The television show 60 Minutes did a segment about her struggles to keep her baby and through the efforts of a young woman lawyer she won early parole Now theres a movie called Love Child based on her story produced by Paul Maslansky and directed by Larry Peerce Miss Moore Amy Madigan the actress who plays her in the movie and Mr Maslansky are sitting in the living room of a hotel suite discussing the queer turns taken by fate In the next room Mr Peerce is nursing a cold and from time to time he appears and adds a wheezy footnote Miss Moore says she liked the idea of having herself played by an unknown  I said Sure if Im goin up Id like to take somebody with me   but she hated the final screenplay I came back an hour after I gave it to her says Mr Maslansky and there it was in shreds I just felt they were going to make me look cheap says Miss Moore I thought they were going to present my love affair with Eddie just the sexual parts It wasnt like that It wasnt all sex for us We were scared we were nervous we didnt enjoy it at all And thats why I blew up Talking her feelings through with Mr Maslansky and Mr Peerce reassured Miss Moore who had been hired as technical adviser on the picture and the venture went ahead Miss Madigan who somewhat resembles Miss Moore  both are rangy narrow boned with husky voices  says it was strange to play a living person I truly didnt want to imitate her but I know what it is to be hurt by a man and frightened and lonely and I trusted I could get these things across Then Terry saw the dailies and   And I just left her alone interrupts Miss Moore I just let her do her work because it was so great For Miss Madigan whose experience encompassed stage and television and playing piano and singing with a rock band this was a first movie and to have gotten the lead still seems a miracle After I did my screen test I went back to my job she says and that night Ive got to tell you I was the worst waitress Besides viewing Love Child as a terrific acting opportunity for herself Miss Madigan thinks audiences get a lift from it too You see the change from a very frightened somewhat violent person to someone who grows through love I hope people take that from the movie that you can change you can win Nobody meeting Miss Moore would deny this After her release from prison she went to Fort Lauderdale Fla to see her babys father I verified that he was married she says and I just felt he should stay with his wife I figured all that pressure I didnt need I didnt want to go back to that Home again in Orlando she supported herself and the baby by working at a Howard Johnsons And when I met her Mr Maslansky says she was driving a bus between the Orlando Airport and Budget RentaCar The future doesnt worry Terry Jean Moore I live minute by minute she says because I know what its like to get time taken from me

Liberalism,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/31/magazine/new-york-gubernatorial-campaign-referendum-with-national-overtones-old.html,St Thomas More or Sandy Koufax Somewhere between them lies the man who could well be the next Governor of New York Until very recently a portrait of the saint who wrote Utopia and then lost his head to King Henry VIII hung on the wall of Lieut Gov Mario Cuomos law office in Queens Mr Cuomo the Democratic candidate for Governor in Tuesdays election is a lifelong admirer of the man he sees as a practical ambitious politicianlawyer who was willing to pay the ultimate price for principle The portrait had to come down Mr Cuomo says because of snide suggestions that the candidate was flaunting his religiosity But some Cuomo allies aware of suspicions that Mr Cuomo was inherently a political loser see the martyrs removal as a sign The man who lost the New York City mayoral election back in 1977 has no intention of coming in second in this years race to succeed Hugh L Carey who has chosen to retire A profile of Lewis E Lehrman Mr Cuomos opponent begins on the opposite page All of which leads Patrick Caddell the candidates pollster now as he was then to a baseball analogy In 1977 Mr Caddell says he was very much like Sandy Koufax sitting on the bench of the Los Angeles Dodgers Everyone knew Koufax had great potential and a great fast ball But he had no control and no curve And then one day Sandy Koufax had it all He had the fast ball a curve that dropped off the table and pinpoint control He went from being an enigma as a pitcher to one of the most awesome pitchers of our time And that argues Mr Caddell is what happened to Mario Cuomo on Sept 23 when he scored an upset victory in the Democratic primary over the very man who had defeated him five years earlier Mayor Edward I Koch There was no transition Mr Caddell says Cuomo has gone from being a man who had a lot of potential but couldnt seem to put it all together to one of the most awesome candidates Ive ever dealt with On Tuesday the voters will render a verdict on the Cuomo candidacy but along the way they will be making a larger decision It will shape the future of the two parties not only in New York which gave Ronald Reagan a plurality of its votes in 1980 but in the nation A Gov Mario Cuomo with ties to both the CarterMondale and Kennedy wings of the national Democratic Party would be influential in the struggle for the partys 1984 Presidential nomination More to the point the New York State contest is a clash of ideologies of two dramatically different visions of the proper role of government On the one side is Lewis E Lehrman a 44yearold economic libertarian who thinks that governments main purpose is to insure public safety and who would otherwise pretty much like the state to get out of the way of free markets and free people With these views and a program for a 40 percent tax cut that resonates with the Presidents supplyside economics Mr Lehrman is widely regarded as a Reagan lookalike In fact Mr Lehrman is a truer believer in small government than Ronald Reagan himself  to the point of wanting to cut the national defense budget Work save invest are Lew Lehrmans words the words of a man who prides himself on having grown up as he puts it in the land of Babbitt Crime is not to be countenanced in that land and Mr Lehrman vehemently calls for a war on savages and for the return of capital punishment as a deterrent His yearlong campaign is built upon money most of it his own and television commercials he expects to spend some 10 million before the campaign is over more than twice as much as his opponent On the other side is Mario Cuomo a 50yearold liberal committed to using the government to promote as he likes to put it jobs and justice He proclaims such unfashionable words as New Deal and Great Society with pride for he harks back in his ideals and constituencies not so much to Jimmy Carter as to Hubert Humphrey Mr Cuomo opposes capital punishment and laws that would ban abortion And the people who support him tend to be some of the old liberal faithful particularly unions Jews and blacks In fact lacking his opponents financial resources Mr Cuomo is building his campaign on the labor of thousands of volunteers most of them from the publicemployee unions In a sense the terms of the contest have been framed by Mr Lehrman who entered the fray armed with elaborate plans for coping with two central issues crime and the recession These problems are real enough on the state level with the public ever more fearful of crime and New York losing major chunks of its industrial base to other states Yet both the candidates and the electorate are aware that the issues transcend New Yorks boundaries In this campaign with these contenders the voters of New York may offer an important clue to just where the nation is headed toward more of the new conservatism or toward a return engagement with the old liberalism The candidate stood outside a state office building in Harlem a skyscraper legacy of Nelson A Rockefellers stewardship of New York On this sunny October afternoon Mario Cuomo was wearing a white shirt a pinstripe suit and a conservative tie but he missed the preppy look aspired to by so many politicians these days The suits polyester count was just a bit too high For a few moments he engaged in a vigorous debate with a woman selling Bible tracts The rugged 6foot1inch candidate towered over her as she firmly informed him that he was an employee of Satan like all politicians Mr Cuomo defended his trade but asked for a prayer Inside the candidate spoke to more than 100 black ministers in a glassandconcrete meeting room Christ never made a 30second commercial he said But Christs message Mr Cuomo went on endured for 2000 years and it could be summed up in one word The audience shouted it out Love they said  and they were right As Governor Mr Cuomo said I will see my job as taking care of the people who are ill of the people in wheelchairs  taking care of the people who need help Black ministers have in elections past demonstrated a remarkable ability to send their congregants to the polls And as a liberal Mr Cuomo can count on heavy majorities among blacks as well as among Jewish and Latin voters and on a strong majority among tradeunion members As a Roman Catholic he enjoys many of the same advantages as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Governor Carey  he can poach on property that is often Republican Whereas Messrs Moynihan and Carey have had ethnic appeal to New Yorks large numbers of conservative IrishAmericans Mr Cuomo has a direct line to the ItalianAmerican community which usually supports Republicans Nor is an ItalianAmerican voter likely to overlook the presence on the ticket of Alfred B DelBello the Westchester County Executive who is running for Lieutenant Governor It is said Edward S Lurie executive director of the Republican State Committee a matter of pasta versus issues To keep all these groups pulling together Mr Cuomo relies on his 24yearold son Andrew who became the campaigns operational chief after graduating from law school Andrew Cuomo has demonstrated an intuitive skill at motivating people and developing strategies he is also by most reports the one member of the Cuomo team who can argue successfully with the candidate When Mr Lehrman first offered his tax program Mr Cuomo was inclined to ignore it his son convinced him he should counterattack Neither father nor son however quite succeeds in giving the frenetic campaign headquarters in Manhattans garment district a semblance of orderliness There are never enough telephone lines for example and the candidates daily schedules often seem subject to whimsy Mario Cuomo also counts on a media campaign crafted by Harvey Cohen a young consultant deep in his first statewide effort and a field operation built by the hands and brains of the states labor movement particularly the publicemployee unions During the primary nurses and file clerks and window cleaners by the thousands dialed telephones and knocked on doors and got the voters to the polls Norman Adler the politicalaction director of District Council 37 the New York City municipal labor union likes to say that Mr Cuomo won in the streets The ethnic mix of the Cuomo campaign and the labor muscle behind it have an oldfashioned liberal look to them and Mr Cuomos campaign speeches also have an oldfashioned sound Consider how the candidate dramatizes the differences between himself and his opponent the man who made his fortune on the chain of Rite Aid drugstores Running a government is not like running a drugstore or a private corporation And that is very close to the heart of the matter The Republicans  Lehrman included  really use these references sincerely If I ran a drugstore I can run a government Why They miss the obvious difference A drugstore a corporation deals with people who can afford a product Government supplies it to people who couldnt afford it without government You couldnt build your own schools you couldnt build your own hosptals you couldnt build your own roads and bridges Because youre in a wheelchair you couldnt feed yourself We have the obligation to do it Now the trial lawyer begins speaking as if Lew Lehrman were in the room Thats the difference between my business and your business You deal with bottom line and dividend Im not in a profitmaking business You believe that God helps those whom God has helped  the ones who can afford the product We dont So Mr Cuomo is a big spender right He vehemently denies the charge You say that Im a liberal and that I believe in spending money by increasing state agencies Where in my record did you get that The truth is you can balance the budget and have social compassion at the same time The campaign has revolved almost exclusively around two issues jobs and crime That is what the candidates are talking about that is what the voters tell the polltakers they care about For Mario Cuomo New Yorks economic problems have been caused by Washington and the solutions have come out of Albany The states unemployment level of 86 percent for example is 15 points below the national figure One explanation The recession of the mid1970s hit the state so hard that a significant number of older manufacturers simply went out of business leaving todays economy much closer to the serviceoriented postindustrial society that many experts say the nation is headed toward But Mr Cuomo gives much of the credit to the broad program of incometax cuts put through by Governor Carey Among them was a reduction of the top tax rate from 15 percent to 10 percent a break for the welltodo that according to Mr Cuomo made the state better able to compete with its neighbors and the rest of the country for new business investment Mr Cuomo put out a position paper on the economy among his goals a major investment in the states rapidly deteriorating roads bridges and sewers and a cap on state spending to make future tax cuts possible But he acknowledged that his paper was mainly a response to Mr Lehrmans own taxcut plan which is based on the belief that the states taxes are still not low enough to bring new companies running Mr Lehrman would slash the income tax by 40 percent over eight years eventually cut the sales tax in half and trim a variety of other taxes  all of which he argues would unleash economic growth For weeks Mr Cuomo has been attacking his opponent as an economic radical and charging that the Lehrman program could cause a fiscal crisis  not too dissimilar Mr Cuomo says from the impact of President Reagans tax cuts on the current economy The safest vote Mr Cuomo argues  the conservative vote really  is a Democratic vote And he bolsters his notion by quoting Republican politicians who have also questioned the Lehrman plan The war on crime  the second major national issue that resonates in New York is a favorite of the political right which is traditionally comfortable in the role of the party of order And there is no doubt that the death penalty for example is popular Polls show that 70 percent of the states voters are for it Mr Lehrmans relentless television campaign in support of that solution and the appointment of tough judges has according to some polls convinced a plurality of voters that he is likely to be a more effective crime fighter than Mr Cuomo But Mr Cuomo offers his own share of toughtalking purple prose He speaks of muggers for example as the midnight mayors of the metropolis noting that his 19yearold daughter Maria has been mugged twice And Mr Cuomos television spots show police officers proclaiming that he is the strongest candidate on crime issues Theres a difference he says between being tough and being loud He argues for life imprisonment without parole as an alternative to the death penalty  which he says is the politicians easy answer to a problem that has resisted simple solutions since the time of Adam and Eve Crime is but one of that panoply of issues that strikes a chord among angry  and traditionally Democratic workingclass voters These socalled social issues have threatened the Democratic coalition ever since George S McGovern was tagged in 1972 as the candidate of acid amnesty and abortion On all such questions Mr Cuomo takes the traditionally liberal line He would keep abortion legal and continue government financing of abortions for poor women and he supports a homosexualrights bill But in his heart Mr Cuomo is an economic liberal more than a lifestyle liberal How traditional is he Lets put it this way says his son Andrew Im still waiting for my talk on sex My father used to tell me whenever I went out with someone Just remember that the girl youre going out with tonight is somebody elses sister  In the 1977 mayoral campaign the television advertisements created by Gerald Rafshoon Jimmy Carters media adviser emphasized Mr Cuomos adherence to traditional values and family life Rafshoon had me as an ethnic peanut farmer Mr Cuomo said and he thought the commercials ineffective But they did reflect a central fact of the Cuomo campaign  that like Jimmy Carter the candidates conservative life style balances his liberal political views Mario Matthew Cuomo was born on June 15 1932 to parents who had emigrated from Salerno Italy His father dug ditches in New Jersey eventually saving enough money to open a 24hour grocery store in South Jamaica Queens a heterogenous neighborhood tipping toward a black majority The store prospered and in 1949 the family moved to Holliswood in the hills of eastern Queens a leafy neighborhood where Mario and Matilda Cuomo still live and where they raised their five children Mr Cuomo attended St Johns Prep a Catholic high school He was a good enough baseball player to be signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system but he left the game in short order The immediate cause was an injury caused by an errant pitch but he offers another reason today I was a lousy ballplayer I couldnt hit a curve ball Mr Cuomo was graduated from St Johns University summa cum laude and enrolled at St Johns University Law School He married Matilda Raffa soon after and Page 69 her salary as a gradeschool teacher supported the couple until his graduation in 1956 For more than 15 years Mr Cuomo dedicated himself to his law practice and to teaching law classes at his alma mater He was something of a workaholic which he now says kept him away from his family more than he would have liked I wish I had gotten to know Andrew better Mr Cuomo a compulsive diarykeeper noted recently in his campaign log But neither Mr Cuomos children nor his marriage seems to have suffered In fact the gubernatorial campaign is something of a family affair Matilda Cuomo who was initially uncomfortable about his going into politics has herself taken to the campaign trail Most of the children who range from 12 to 27 years of age contribute their spare time Maria has taken off six months from college to work in the campaign And then there is Andrew with whom Mario Cuomo has a complex relationship which the son describes as a mixture of love trust and competitiveness The two are close frequently locked in debate they once played basketball together but Andrew says he gave up because his father can be positively mean under the boards Mario Cuomos career in the public eye began in 1966 when he represented 69 families in the Corona section of Queens whose homes were about to be destroyed by the city to make room for a new high school Eventually the city accepted Mr Cuomos compromise which shaved down the size of the school and saved all the homes while requiring the city to move 14 of them But the experience bred in Mr Cuomo a deep mistrust of the ways of bureaucracies In 1972 Mr Cuomo was asked by then Mayor John V Lindsay to mediate another explosive dispute The Mayor was proposing to build three 24story towers that would house lowincome people most of whom were black in the middleclass Forest Hills section of Queens most of which was white Another Cuomo compromise led to the projects being cut in half maintaining the principle of building housing for the poor in middleincome areas Mr Cuomo says without building so much of it that the middle class would leave thus resegregating the neighborhood One of the lessons of Forest Hills Mr Cuomo argues is that much of what passes for racial conflict in our society is really a kind of class conflict among groups differentiated more by their incomes educations and habits than by the color of their skin In the course of the controversy Mr Cuomo also learned to be impatient with those liberals who condemned from afar the angry responses of white families whose lives were being threatened with disruption Almost every aspect of Mario Cuomos political life has been complicated by his relationship with Hugh L Carey It was summed up recently by Mr Cuomo in these terms You have to have a pretty strong relationship to do everything we did to each other and have it still survive The two men met on the St Johns campus where Mr Carey who is 13 years older was in law school and Mr Cuomo was an undergraduate The friendship ripened when they were both active in the St Thomas More Lawyers Guild In 1969 Congressman Carey ran for Mayor and tried unsuccessfuly to recruit Mr Cuomo to run for comptroller on his ticket Mr Carey eventually dropped out of the race Mr Cuomo ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1974 on a ticket headed by Howard Samuels a businessman who had long been active in Democratic politics The SamuelsCuomo combination had the endorsement of the Democratic State Committee they were the organization candidates  but the primary was won in an upset by Hugh Carey and Mary Anne Krupsak defeated Mr Cuomo After winning the general election Mr Carey appointed his onetime ally Mario Cuomo as Secretary of State Three years later with the Governor as his chief inspiration and cheerleader Mr Cuomo was persuaded  after a long public display of indecision about whether he was really the best candidate  to run for Mayor of New York City It was a bizarre contest First Mr Cuomo lost the Democratic nomination to Edward I Koch then Governor Carey shifted his endorsement to Mr Koch finally campaigning in the general election on the Liberal Party line Mr Cuomo lost again but he garnered 41 percent of the votes a much higher total than anyone had expected Mr Cuomo was far more comfortable in the runoff than in the primary The pressure was off Mr Caddell says The voters seemed to like the new confidence and the less acerbic debating style and according to one postelection analysis they liked him better because they felt that Mr Careys defection had made Mr Cuomo the antiestablishment candidate Governor Carey moreover had lost much of his own popularity A year later when he was opposed for renomination by his own Lieutenant Governor Miss Krupsak Mr Carey feared he might be in trouble and he had to find a new running mate He asked Mario Cuomo the man he had left in the lurch and Mr Cuomo accepted Mr Carey was renominated and the CareyCuomo ticket behind in the polls for most of the campaign triumphed Yet as one associate of both men says I dont think Carey ever completely forgave Mario for the fact that Carey needed him so much During the 1982 gubernatorial primary and now during the campaign itself Mr Cuomo has made much of his post Experience Money Cant Buy is one of his slogans And polls indicate the voters think that being Lieutenant Governor is a perfect preparation for being Governor Mr Cuomos tenure has not been untroubled One of his worst problems was the conviction of his chief of staff William Cabin who had placed several nonexistent names on Mr Cuomos payroll and then cashed their checks Mr Cuomo himself discovered the scheme and turned Mr Cabin over to the law and the state has recovered the funds But the episode had been used by Mayor Koch and then Mr Lehrman to bolster charges that the Lieutenant Governor is unable to hire a good staff Hes going to have to prove executive ability and prove he can pick competent people says David Garth Mayor Kochs media adviser But I think hes smart enough to do it Meanwhile Mr Cuomo and Mr Carey were sparring There was for example Mr Cuomos decision to head President Carters reelection campaign in New York at a time when Hugh Carey harbored some Presidential ambitions of his own There was the period from the middle of 1980 through at least the middle of 1981 when the Governors erratic behavior made him a difficult man to get along with even by the accounts of his closest allies And at one point there were rumors that Mr Carey intended to dump Mr Cuomo as Lieutenant Governor Mr Cuomo was certain that the rumors came from Mr Careys inner circle from which he was largely excluded He proceeded to hold a dinner to raise funds for his own campaign chest An associate of Mr Carey and Mr Cuomo said that the 300000 the dinner brought in aggravated Mr Careys worries about his Lieutenant Governor Until Governor Carey announced last January that he would not run for reelection it was widely thought that Mr Cuomo might challenge him Two weeks ago mulling over their relationship Hugh Carey offered this explanation Its very hard to share your confidence with a man who might run against you Maybe I look for too much allegiance Immediately after Governor Careys announcement of his retirement Mr Cuomo joined the gubernatorial race but most politicians dismissed his candidacy as soon as Mayor Koch entered the lists Not Mario Cuomo Two months before the primary in his office behind the State Senate chamber in Albany the genial candidate was sitting with his feet up on his desk trading jokes and poking fun at himself and the reporters who were covering his race He exuded confidence although he had been unable to get much media attention for his campaign virtually every important Democrat in the state had suggested he quit and the polls showed him far behind Mayor Koch This is not like 1977 Mr Cuomo said This year I have a rationale and Ed Koch doesnt The word is a favorite rationale It goes with being a trial lawyer and carrying around a briefing book with a page in it headed The Case for MMC In 1977 Mr Cuomo said I was just one of many candidates each of whom could have been as good a Mayor as I Koch Badillo Sutton Abzug even Beame  they all could do it But this year what makes the most sense and everybody knows it is that I step up to be Governor which is what Ive been prepared for and Koch stays on as Mayor of New York City I was at Brighton Beach the other day and I asked the crowd How many of you like Ed Koch and there were lots of cheers And I asked And how many of you like me and I got applause  not as much as Koch but enough And I said Good because you can have both of us Vote for me and Ill be Governor and Ed Koch will stay as Mayor And they laughed But I could see they were thinking And it worked for Mario Cuomo almost exactly as he said it would The rationale triumphed over pollsters politicians and pundits not to mention over a betterfinanced opponent who had been thought of as the states most formidable campaigner It also turned the tables on Hugh Carey who had cast his lot with Mayor Koch Why have the two men had so much trouble with each other Says Michael J DelGiudice who was Governor Careys director of policy management The Lieutenant Governor is so close to power sees it exercised but cant exercise it himself In this case it was complicated by the fact that you had two smart very articulate alwaysthinking individuals the same kind of political characters  being so close to each other It was inevitable that they would have disagreements Mr Carey himself offers a similar thought What did he have to look forward to No one who is qualified to be No 1 ever wants to be No 2 The resentment that is part of his relationship with Hugh Carey poured out early one morning when Mr Cuomo was asked why the Governor had endorsed Mayor Koch this year He thought Koch was going to win Mr Cuomo replied and then went on to talk of Mr Careys prospects Whats his future Hes going to have to live here with Harry Helmsley at 21 for the rest of his life he said a reference to the Manhattan realestate tycoon and the swank restaurant And Engie and he living in Westchester Mr Cuomo continued referring to the Governors second wife Evangeline Gouletas Carey With whom With the realestate people and the money people and the 21 people Theyre all going to be with Koch Its all one big circle Then Mr Cuomo offered his own version of what Mr Carey was thinking This guy Cuomo cant win Why should I be neutral and be left out What do I get if Im neutral Yet the two men are still on speaking terms in fact Governor Carey has become a strong advocate of wouldbe Governor Cuomo and Mr Cuomo now says that Mr Carey has a future on the national political scene The two men bumped into each other recently at a meeting of the Democratic State Committee I put my arm around him Mr Cuomo recalls and I said Were going to win this one in November He was relieved felt good Then Mr Cuomo laughed Its a peculiar relationship he said So what happens if Mario Cuomo does win on Tuesday A Cuomo victory is not likely to result in any drastic changes from the course pursued by Hugh Carey though Mr Cuomo argues that he will have more success than Mr Carey at getting his program through the State Legislature The candidate is well liked personally by many legislators including Republicans and he says he would build up personal relationshipswith individual legislators and seek prior consultation with leaders practices Mr Carey disdained There is some doubt however over how well Mr Cuomo will get along with Stanley Fink the Assembly Speaker The two men are philosophically in tune but their ambitions overlap Mr Finks plans to run for Governor this year were shelved when Mayor Koch announced his candidacy Mr Lehrman argues that his opponents debt to publiclabor bosses would loom large in a Cuomo administration Mr Cuomo is already on record as favoring potentially expensive changes in pension laws that match the desires of the publicemployee unions And Mr Cuomo has also supported reform  Mr Lehrman calls it a weakening  of the Taylor law which bars strikes by public employees Mr Cuomos supporters contend that the very weakness of the economy militates against any major financial concessions to the unions In fact Mr Cuomo as Governor would confront a number of unhappy choices It is the nature of the old Democratic coalition he is trying to revive that its parts will sometimes collide A prime example the white ethnics versus the black and Latin minorities  Forest Hills revisited The candidate himself acknowledges that his hopes of helping the poor will be limited by his desire to balance the budget Im ready for that he says Youre going to have to make a lot of people unhappy On the national level any newly elected New York Governor automatically becomes a power to reckon with and that would include the candidate who insists he wants no such talk Im not a national voice Im not a national figure Mr Cuomo says In fact Mr Cuomos victory over Ed Koch and the manner of his achieving it running against Ronald Reagan and conservatism guarantee him national attention Mr Cuomo also benefits from ties to both the Kennedy and the CarterMondale wings of the Democratic Party Jimmy Carter was one of Mr Cuomos strongest supporters in the primary and Mr Cuomo worked with Mr Mondale during the 1980 campaign At the same time as the carrier of liberalisms banner in the Democratic primary Mr Cuomo drew support from many of Senator Ted Kennedys staunchest allies in the union movement and elsewhere Given those connections Mr Cuomo would probably play more than a grandstand role in the jockeying for the 1984 Democratic Presidential sweepstakes Should he be elected though Mr Cuomos strongest influence may be personal and philosophical The reason Mario Cuomo will be a very important national figure said Meyer S Frucher a top Carey administration official and Cuomo adviser is that he can talk to his roots and represent them And his roots are the very people who are abandoning the Democratic Party the working class the sons and daughters of immigrants Mario Cuomo will be very important in translating the aspirations of the new immigrants  the minorities  to the old immigrants The candidate walks into the kitchen of his modest home in Queens It is after midnight on the day of his first television debate with Lew Lehrman Mr Cuomo is pleased but a bit uneasy The trial lawyer has made his classic presentation sometimes sarcastic sometimes amusing always forceful maybe too forceful Mr Cuomo is singing Kiss Today Goodbye He turns his cheek toward Matilda winning a kiss He turns his cheek toward his daughter Maria and gets another Andrew sits at the table munching on crumb cake Another room of the house is filled with piles of wedding gifts Margaret the eldest daughter is getting marrried on Sunday Mr Cuomo starts talking about the events of the day Pacing around the kitchen he uses his arms and eyebrows mimicking chuckling at a joke recounting some of his own better lines Matilda Cuomo enjoys the spectacle She says that her son the politician is sending her upstate to campaign for 11 days Maria reports on events at campaign headquarters and Mr Cuomo responds by teasing his daughter and her friend Sandra Pleskun about their love lives Then Mr Cuomo turns serious talking first about Hugh Carey then on to larger political and philosophical issues Mario Cuomo is a complicated man On the one hand he is outgoing and ebullient freely sharing his ideas with anyone who cares to come along for the ride Says Adam Walinsky a lawyer who once wrote speeches for Robert Kennedy but has since moved to the political right and is backing Mr Lehrman Marios an enormously engaging man with a superb sense of humor Hes a guy you enjoy spending time with having dinner with arguing with Yet Mr Cuomo is also deeply introspective He often speaks of his childhood of the boy from the wrong side of the tracks the outsider There was the parents day at St Johns Prep for example You had to bring your parents to the school he recalls but everybody in the school was Irish An occasional Italian but highclass Italian  son of doctor son of lawyer And I had to say Bring mama and papa here from the grocery store They wouldnt understand a word So I decided not to ask them to come To save them from embarrassment There has never been a judgment in my life that I have rued more Mr Cuomo is a reflective intellectual He fills his conversations and speeches with quotes from the Bible or John Dos Passos or John Donne He relishes the English language and the usage thereof playing word games polishing phrases making fun of the jumbled syntax of a reporters question The book he wrote about the Forest Hills controversy a critical success was a reverie on the ambiguities of public life On this late night in his kitchen at the end of a long rambling discussion  Andrew Cuomo is nodding off to sleep  Mario Cuomo talks of his admiration for the thoughts of the Catholic writer Pierre Teilhard de Chardin It has to do Mr Cuomo says with trying to understand evil Catholicism is a troublesome thing he says It suggests a God who is terribly shortsighted and who created the world as a series of moral obstacles And theres just something unreasonable about that and thats the way you were raised Everythings a sin God doesnt want you to enjoy this or enjoy that If you have a good time youre probably doing something wrong And then he continues his voice rising in excitement this French Jesuit writes a book that begins To those who love this world   He never talks about heaven and hell He never talks about sin except as an experience all of us go through All life is good all living is good God intended you to make the most of it in human terms by following the instincts that you have as a human being God intended you to suffer evil and experience evil and to think of evil as being some kind of flaw in the stone that you sculpt around And you dont treat it as a disfiguring or debasement Its something that you scuplt around And the flaw becomes part of the whole life and thats rejection failure tragedy its all part of the whole An existentialist for Governor A man who until a month ago was thought by many in politics to be unable to cope with being a frontrunner an insider a winner A Sandy Koufax who has suddenly found his curve ball The final inning is only two days off
Map; ASSEMBLY RACE IN THE NEW 18TH WATCHED FOR MANY REASONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/31/nyregion/map-assembly-race-in-the-new-18th-watched-for-many-reasons.html,PERHAPS more than in any other election race on Long Island this year there is a special sense of history among the three candidates in the oddly shaped territory that has been marked off under reapportionment as the new 18th Assembly District in Nassau County One reason for this feeling is that the 18th is the first suburban district in New York State in which black and Hispanic residents outnumber whites Political strategists say this may not necessarily be reflected in the result Tuesday Whites are generally considered as more likely to vote and the returns from the 18th will be scrutinized for clues on whether that pattern continues in the district which is bisected by the Southern State Parkway and includes all or parts of Uniondale Roosevelt Lakeview and Freeport Another reason that the race is being watched closely is that both candidates of the major parties are black women who disagree on many major issues The DemocraticLiberal candidate is Barbara A Patton of Freeport a 38yearold lawyer She graduated from Hofstra Law School in January the same month that her RepublicanConservative opponent Briding G Newell of Roosevelt became the executive assistant to the Nassau County Commissioner of Commerce and Industry Also running is Joan M Kennedy of Freeport the candidate of the Right to Life Party Mrs Patton and Miss Newell have been running aggressive campaigns and their headquarters are across the street from each other in Hempstead Early in the campaign Mrs Patton concentrated on walking through the 18ths 70 election districts  ringing doorbells introducing herself and urging voters to remember her when they go to the polls Miss Newells campaign by contrast has placed less emphasis on fleshpressing and more on telephoning voters to win their support although Miss Newell has done her share of doortodoor campaigning as well Miss Newell estimates that she will have spent 20000 to 25000 on her campaign by the time the polls open Mrs Patton says she has had less money to spend but feels that her chances are better because people have had enough of Reaganomics and of Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau County Republican chairman who was convicted last year of mail fraud and exortion When the day comes that people sense something is wrong in the country you cannot allow cynicism to rule you Mrs Patton said I dont consider myself a bleeding heart but I have a sense of right reason and thats what counts Miss Newell said that being a black Republican candidate in a minority area is going against one of the norms We as a culture across the country are largely Democratic and here we are trying to elect a Republican Miss Newell said The leaders did not give this away  we worked for it and its the chance of a lifetime The two candidates agree that one of the things the districts Assemblyman should do is work to bring increased school aid back from Albany They also identify jobs crime and housing as major concerns but they differ on what to do on those issues and disagree on other issues such as abortion While ringing doorbells in Hempstead on a recent afternoon Mrs Patton said she was prochoice but added The right to choose is different from proabortion Miss Newell said she disliked the fact that abortion has become a political issue  Its a personal decision after all she said as she sipped tea in her campaign headquarters She said she believed in the concept of limited abortion and was opposed to abortion on demand She said she supported it only in cases involving rape incest or danger to the health of the mother On the death penalty Mrs Patton said she was opposed unequivocally and favored consecutive sentences instead Miss Newell supports the death penalty Mrs Patton criticized Miss Newell for supporting Mr Margiotta who was sentenced to a twoyear prison term but remains free pending his appeals In Nassau County weve been talking about crime Mrs Patton said Mr Margiotta is a convicted felon I remember from my law courses that thats the most heinous crime there is You have to say no to that kind of thing Miss Newell said she did not expect the Margiotta issue to overshadow the larger issues of the campaign Im the first minority Republican candidate she said Im not getting a large feedback on Mr Margiotta
THE NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN: A REFERENDUM WITH NATIONAL OVERTONES; The New Right,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/31/magazine/new-york-gubernatorial-campaign-referendum-with-national-overtones-new-right.html,Three men were sitting on a squalid West 84th Street stoop in Manhattan the other day when Lewis L Lehrmans limousine eased between doubleparked cars Hey Lehrman they yelled raising beer cans in salute Hey thats Lehrman They had spotted the sharp features and crinkly white hair that several million dollars worth of television ads had made familiar throughout the state and the recognition was instant It was just the kind of recognition that has helped to catapult Lew Lehrman over the ranks of skeptical party regulars and onto Tuesdays ballot as the RepublicanConservative candidate for Governor Mr Lehrman 44 a newcomer to party politics whose fortune was made in his familys Rite Aid discount drugstore chain has financed the longest and most expensive television campaign ever staged in any state election saturating New York with his gettough message on crime  Its time to take the handcuffs off the police  and his gettougher remedy for the economy  he would cut the state income tax by 40 percent over eight years In the process Lew Lehrman and his red suspenders have become as familiar as Mr Whipple The story his nascent political career is packed with lessons and portents about the condition of state and national government Locally Mr Lehrmans candidacy is providing voters with that rarity in politics a clearcut choice between conflicting philosophies Mr Lehrmans newstyle if highly individualistic Republican conservatism and the oldfashioned Democratic liberalism of his opponent Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo A Lehrman victory would in fact turn politics and government in New York State upside down That Mr Lehrman a newcomer with more foes than friends among the partys leaders has won the Republican nomination on the strength of a television blitz aimed right at the voters calls into question the effectiveness and very meaning of the party organization A Lehrman win on Tuesday would change dramatically the character of New York State Republicanism Following the election of conservative Senator Alphonse M DAmato in 1980 it would represent the final demise of the liberal Republicanism that has lingered on after the death of Nelson A Rockefeller in 1979 It would also confirm a major role for the Conservative Party whose programs and objectives would have to be incorporated into the Republican legislative agenda The outcome of this gubernatorial race will have significance for President Reagans future as well While Mr Lehrman has sought to demonstrate that his economic ideas differ from the Presidents he has been bombarded by Mr Cuomos assertion that the New York election represents a referendum on Reaganomics and doubtless that is how the outcome will be viewed Not only that but a New York governed by a Conservative and represented by a Conservative junior Senator would automatically become a key player in the Republicans national game plan for the 1984 Presidential election Lew Lehrmans impressive debut in bigtime politics reflects one of his salient characteristics singlemindedness His decision to enter politics came he says after he had spent 13 years at Rite Aid and become a millionaire at least 50 times over We had built a great company Mr Lehrman says I was approaching 40 I believed that with financial independence there were other things I could do He resigned as president of the company in 1977 and moved to New York City Mr Lehrman took up residence in the city at about the same time Dr Bernard M Kilbourn became state chairman of a Republican Party still mourning the loss of Nelson Rockefeller and his everready checkbook Dr Kilbourn began romancing rich people who could help him pay off the partys 800000 debt One of them was Mr Lehrman The quid pro quo for Mr Lehrmans cash was visibility Dr Kilbourn made him platform chairman in 1978 and he quickly began to act like a candidate Mr Lehrman picks up the story over a beer in his Park Avenue coop I believed that ideas would rule he says So he held hearings all over the state The logistics he says were easy Look I know New York cold from opening Rite Aid stores I know labor halls I know Rotary Clubs I just know He made friends with a lot of people listened to local leaders bought them breakfast made a mailing list promised to keep in touch And we completed the platform Mr Lehrman says and then  he makes the motions of typing and binding and tidying a report  we presented it He laughs Politely party leaders accepted the platform and just as politely they ignored it as they usually do I discovered then says Mr Lehrman that ideas dont always rule It is rulers he realized who rule and he decided to become one Word began to spread that Lew Lehrman was a man on the move After Ronald Reagan was elected President friends floated Mr Lehrmans name as a possible Secretary of the Treasury See he says as his wife Louise brings in another beer all during this time I wanted to be in public service but my idea was to serve as an appointee of a Governor or a President But I soon said to myself Lew youve got a few unorthodox ideas Maybe one of your old pals isnt going to appoint you to office  He laughed at the joke on himself So I said Youre going to have to go out and win a franchise for yourself  And he did By late 1981 he had been given a private promise from Conservative leaders that he could have their partys line for Governor a valuable chip in his subsequent bargaining with Republicans According to Serphin R Maltese the Conservative Partys executive director Mr Lehrman had started talking to party leaders about a political career as early as 1976 But many politicians were still skeptical when Mr Lehrman stepped in front of the cameras last December to start his advertising mileage rolling George L Clark Jr who had succeeded Dr Kilbourn as the Republican state chairman suspected that the television approach might work in a primary but feared that Mr Lehrman would be a terrible candidate in a general election dragging down legislative nominees just when Republicans thought they might win big Remember this was when nearly everyone still thought Democrat Hugh L Carey an increasingly unpopular Governor would seek reelection Republican leaders were looking for one of their own to defeat him The chairman reasoned that while the conservative Mr Lehrman might be able to sell himself to the fairly conservative crowd that votes in a Republican primary the larger and more liberal November electorate could well reject him Besides as head of a party that was starting to rebuild after the disasters of the immediate postRockefeller years he was reluctant to embrace someone whose first allegiance had been to the Conservatives Mr Clark supported State Comptroller Edward V Regan and tried to line up a party consensus for him early this year as the overwhelming favorite Party regulars did not much like Mr Regan who had provided neither jobs for their followers nor the camaraderie politicians tend to cherish But at least they knew him By late winter though Governor Carey had decided he would not run and Mayor Koch had decided he would The Mayor looked like a tough candidate and he proved to be a wellfinanced one Complaining that contributions had dried up Mr Regan decided to run for reelection as State Comptroller instead of for Governor Meanwhile the impact of the Lehrman television barrage was becoming apparent Polls showed him as the bestknown Republican candidate for Governor Suddenly he was the man to beat And he proved unbeatable In June Mr Lehrman ran away with the Republican convention Paul J Curran an establishment lawyer and a former United States Attorney got enough votes to stay in the primary but his threadbare campaign proved no match for the lavish effort run  and mostly paid for by Mr Lehrman who reported that he had contributed 63 million of his own money to a primary that cost 88 million overall Mr Curran spent a scant 385000 Mr Cuomo 17 million and Mr Koch 36 million It was a performance that won Mr Lehrman some allies in his own party The day after the primary former Attorney General Louis J Lefkowitz showed up at Mr Lehrmans side Extremely bright A very quick learner the venerable Republican said turning an affectionate smile on Mr Lehrman A quarter of a century earlier Mr Lefkowitz had helped instruct another millionaire Mr Rockefeller in the ways of New York street politics Now  after retiring from office by choice four years ago  he is a muchbeloved figure whose kind words are sought by politicians of all persuasions and are almost essential for people in his own party And Mr Clark had already done what grownup politicians must do when they have guessed wrong Though Mr Lehrmans commitment to the Conservative Party still nettled him he realized during the primary campaign that Mr Lehrman was going to win and he endorsed him saying that he had always been impressed with his sincerity and tenacity But other Republican leaders still kept their distance Former Governor Malcolm Wilson who had led the antiLehrman effort at the party convention withheld formal endorsement Former Senator Jacob K Javits endorsed Comptroller Regan for reelection but did not endorse Mr Lehrman Mr Regan himself turned up at Lehrman headquarters on primary night but later declined to give his full endorsement to Mr Lehrmans major paper on state tax reductions We dont talk much Mr Regan said of his relationship with the man at the head of his ticket The man who became the head of the Democratic ticket was a surprise Mr Cuomo was already on the generalelection ballot as the Liberal Party candidate and the Lehrman people had looked forward to a threeway race Mr Lehrman as both the Republican and the Conservative would face Mr Koch the Democrat and Mr Cuomo the Liberal A split in the moderatetoliberal vote might propel the conservative Mr Lehrman into office as it did Mr DAmato two years before Instead it is Mr Lehrman a Jewish newcomer to a liberal state running as RepublicanConservative against a single opponent Mr Cuomo an Italian Roman Catholic the Democrat and Liberal Almost every one of those qualities tilts the odds There are 920000 more enrolled Democrats and Liberals in New York State than there are Republicans and Conservatives Moreover there is an ItalianAmerican population widely thought to be eager to support one of its own for high office and for once able to vote for that candidate in the same election Unlike other big ethnic blocs the Italians are split between the two parties so that usually they vote in separate simultaneous elections  some in the Democratic primary some in the Republican According to a New York Times poll New Yorkers of Italian background would support Mr Cuomo 5 to 4 and some politicians suspect the electionday margin might turn out to be a good deal larger You think the Jews all vote together asked one county Republican leader Waitll you see the Italians Theyve been waiting No one will know until Tuesday but politicians question how heavily Jewish voters will support Mr Lehrman About a fourth of the Democrats who supported Mayor Koch in the primary when he did well among his fellow Jews said they would vote for Mr Lehrman against Mr Cuomo But Jews tend to vote Democratic and Liberal and they are not as hungry for a candidate as the Italians The Times poll showed that Mr Lehrman was strong upstate as Republicans always are and Mr Cuomo was strong in the city as Democrats always are The suburbs were about even Tim Carey Mr Lehrmans field organizer has a precinctbyprecinct map of the state with the number of votes needed in each Upstate the Lehrman campaign has an effective citizen operation in place from the primary In New York City where Republicans never do well anyway television may help So the job Mr Carey says is to duplicate in the suburbs the organization weve already put together upstate The first wave of polls showed the two candidates close The Lehrman people believe as do many other politicians that conservative issues small government focus on family an end to what Mr Lehrman calls the pernicious welfare system a trimming of taxes support of the death penalty  have won converts in both parties In a mailer Mr Lehrman pointed out that people who support him keep talking about things like neighborhood schools busing welfare payments tuition tax credits taxpayerfunded abortions the death penalty  in short the kind of matters that go right to the heart of what is usually referred to as public safety and traditional family values He went on to underline the conservativeliberal confrontation My opponent to his credit has not sought to hide his views He has the support of political figures like Bella Abzug and political organizations like the Liberal Party Its the kind of support that enables you to know exactly where he stands Mr Cuomo a former trial lawyer is a bigleague debater and many thought he trounced Mr Lehrman in their first debate A dissenter to that judgment is Mr Lehrman I feel very good about it he said a few days later I believe campaigns are about ideas and I got to spell out my ideas on economics and court reform I dont feel Mario was able to lay out his alternatives I did what I wanted to Their first major difference arose over taxes and budgets It started with Mr Lehrmans eightyear taxreduction plan Fortynine pages long it was called Program for Job Growth and Tax Reduction and it proposed to cut income taxes 40 percent by 1991 Mr Lehrman declines to say how he would cut state spending to make up for the revenue loss I wish I was Governor right now is all he would say We wouldnt have the disaster we have now Period Mr Cuomo pronounced the plan dead because he said leaders of both legislative houses turned it down At every turn Mr Cuomo tries to link the New York election to Reaganomics Thats an empty campaign Mr Lehrman says The record is clear I was much more interested in a balanced budget much more concerned about the rapid rate of growth in Pentagon spending Yet more than half of those questioned in the Times poll said they associated the views of Mr Lehrman with those of the President But President Reagan has left New York off his schedule of campaign stops We happen to believe Lew Lehrmans going to win without the President coming in said James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff Apart from his economic proposals Mr Lehrmans biggest issue is crime His position paper on the subject focuses on the courts echoing a speech he made in July to a conference of police chiefs and the 30second snippets of Lew Lehrman roll of drums Crime Proposal Number such and such The television spots have promised state money for local police denounced short sentences for violent criminals savages and urged passage of the death penalty and appointment of tough judges To the police chiefs he proposed changes in sentencing and in eligibility for parole In business he told them if it costs nothing to produce a product and the reward is rising then we know the supply of the product and the supply of the producers of the product will also rise So it is with crime Look he said the first purpose of government is to establish justice to provide public safety public order I believe New York State and New York City have failed in that essential first purpose They have frittered away their time on nonessential activities It is the police who maintain public rder he said and  lapsing into the dialect recognizable as Candidatese  It is time to take the handcuffs off the police The Lehrman creed calls for firm fully understood rules Lay them out he says  in economics and everything else  and then set people free to operate under them That is the rationale for among other things his advocacy of a return to the gold standard It is hardly a state issue but Mr Lehrmans support of the gold standard tells a good deal about his political philosophy Gold is a metaphor for stability he says ONLY AFTER His critics say Mr Lehrman wants to turn the clock back to a simpler sort of 19thcentury America Nonsense he says Its my critics who want to turn the clock back who believe the best days are behind us Im an optimist I believe the last three centuries are but a prelude for an American millennium Mario Cuomo is the true conservative in the race Better than anybody I know he represents the politics of the past He grins If there is a reformer in the campaign he says it is I Personally Mr Lehrman and Mr Cuomo share many traits Both love to argue Both are fierce athletic competitors Both have large attractive families One day in late August a 31foot Midas trailer lumbered up to the state Capitol and out swarmed the Lehrman children to inspect the building where their father wants to work All except 3 12yearold Peter He stayed inside asleep Mr Lehrman led the other four through the old Victorian jumble on the hill above downtown Albany Leland 13 was enticed into his first news conference in the Red Room where governors meet the press Someone asked how he thought the building compared with the national Capitol in Washington This is  prettier Leland said very carefully The camera turned away he rolled his eyes in relief and laughing his father clapped him on the shoulder and said Very well done Tiger That was well done Nineyearold Thomas said he would prefer to visit Cooperstown Twelveyearold John contemplated Albany then said Well if Daddy has to come here well come with him During much of the visit 7yearold Eliza wore a little bonnet with a ribbon around her chin a cherubic miniature of her mother Mr Lehrman met Louise Stillman in 1964 when he stopped off to see her brothers friends from Yale They were married two years later and political associates say there is no one whose advice he respects as much They came from different worlds She was bigcity WASP brought up in Manhattan daughter of the finance chairman of Time Inc He was smallcity Jewish brought up in Harrisburg Pa where his family owned a wholesale grocery business It was founded by my granddaddy Mr Lehrman said as he sat one evening in his Park Avenue apartment sipping a light beer and reminiscing He was a peddler Shoelaces and sugar  those were his inventory items Granddaddy opened a oneroom grocery not much bigger than this room said Mr Lehrman gesturing around the apartments study But it prospered and his was a solid middleclass merchant family Mr Lehrman said The twins Lewis and Gilbert were born Aug 15 1938 They have an older sister Lois and a younger sister Barbara He was always intense Gilbert Lehrman recalls of his brother He taught himself to read when we were little 3 or 4 years old And hed be concentrating so hard on his comic books youd have to call to him over and over to come out and play Then in school he was always No 1 at everything They started in the public schools but in fifth grade their mother decided they should shift to a private school Daddy was skeptical Lewis Lehrman recalled but Mother felt we should get the very best education Mother always prevailed in this sort of thing The brothers went on to different prep schools  Lewis to Hill Gilbert to Gunnery Lewis recalls being a hardworking though not particularly brilliant student who concentrated on sports His determination exceeded his talent but he always was on some team or other and at age 44 he still jogs for miles One campaign day while Mr Cuomo was making a tour of Brooklyn neighborhoods Mr Lehrman was in Central Park running in a fivemile test for the New York Marathon clocking a respectable 32 minutes and 18 seconds He went on to Yale where he was a friend recalls a roughhouse sort  he rode a motorcycle around and he always used to get into scraps But he also became a serious student Around my sophomore year he said I began to develop a real passion for scholarship In his senior year he took first place in history won a Carnegie teaching fellowship and began seriously to consider a life of teaching The scholarly life did not pan out After two years of teaching history first at Yale then at Harvard he said I began to doubt that scholarship was what I wanted to do I was more than half a commercial man So he went to work full time in the family business which by then had grown from a oneroom grocery store to the Rite Aid chain of discount drugstores In 1969 the Lehrmans decided that they wanted to raise their children in New York and they bought an apartment on Fifth Avenue the former home coincidentally of Richard M Nixon But it turned out Mr Lehrman did not start paying income taxes at New Yorks high rates until 1977 a lapse his opponent in the primary Mr Curran was at pains to point out He had continued as a taxpaying resident of Pennsylvania where Rite Aid has its headquarters and where the tax takers are not so carnivorous as they are in New York In response to Mr Currans suggestion that a wouldbe Governor should have paid taxes to the state he wants to govern Mr Lehrman explained that Louise and the kids had been in New York and he had visited on weekends Mr Lehrman drew a distinction between residence and domicile He still has a residence in Greenwich Conn for instance where the family spends many weekends and he teaches his children to play soccer But he said that on the advice of lawyers and accountants he had kept his domicile in Pennsylvania as long as he remained a Rite Aid executive Since moving to New York he said he has paid 900000 in state and city taxes The image of the harmonious family working together and prospering at Rite Aid was also shaken somewhat during the campaign when Alex Grass Mr Lehrmans former brotherinlaw and an executive of the company made public his objections to what he felt were Mr Lehrmans selfaggrandizing claims about his contribution to the success of the chain But the incident passed Mr Lehrman declared that the firms success had been a team effort and that it was silly to quarrel over comparative credit What might have been a major political mess ended up looking like a family feud While he was still at Rite Aid Mr Lehrman indulged his interest in public policy forming in 1973 a nonprofit foundation the Lehrman Institute Now housed in a luxurious East Side Manhattan townhouse the institute was born over a Formica table in a luncheonette near Yale in 1961 when Nicholas X Rizopoulos now its executive director and Mr Lehrman were both graduate students in history Mr Lehrman was looking for help with a history paper But we realized within five minutes Mr Rizopoulos says that the vibes were just right Lew started daydreaming aloud  what he would do some day if he was rich And what he dreamed of  Mr Rizopoulos waved his arm to encompass the institute  was this place The institute awards research and writing grants For instance it helped underwrite Ronald Steels biography of Walter Lippman and Doris H Kearnss book about Lyndon Johnson It also runs seminars at which an eclectic crowd meets to discuss policy issues Mr Lehrman attributes some of his beliefs to his study of Jacques Rueff the economist who designed the 1958 austerity program that stabilized Frances economy at the outset of the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle When he began to follow Rueffs career he said it was the beginning of my own world view Rueff encouraged budgetary reforms that cut government borrowing in half and he favored the gold standard Lew is  we both are radical conservatives said Mr Rizopoulos Radical Were conservative Mr Rizopoulos said because we have faith in institutions a certain sympathy with elitism good elitism But we still want to see radical changes in society Some hints as to how Lew Lehrman might perform in Albany can be seen in how he has run the campaign to get there He has put together an excellent staff which includes for issues Dick Behn an Albany veteran for field organization Tim Carey for inside manager Karl Ottosen who ran Al DAmatos successful Senate campaign for press secretary John Buckley nephew of William F and James He hired as pollster Richard Wirthlin who has also worked for President Reagan and as media man Roger Ailes who first won fame as the outspoken creator of President Nixons 1968 campaign commercials According to Roger Ailes Mr Lehrman has a lot more personal involvement in the copy and the ideas than most candidates do When reporters are around the staff seems to have a casual comfortable relationship with their boss When he is not around they still speak respectfully of him He listens courteously they say but no one ever forgets that he is the boss Mr Ailes who has worked with many politicians since the Nixon days said Mr Lehrman was a little stiff when he started performing for the cameras But he sort of warmed to the task Mr Ailes said And the television barrage continued Now Mr Lehrman is even able to poke fun at his own image It was stiff at first the candidate staring fiercely at the camera and reciting his position on this or that But Louise Lehrman knew a more relaxed man who though intense could laugh at himself She liked what they called the outtake spot and urged its use So did Gilbert Lehrman Thats the real Lew Lehrman he says Fun Rambunctious The spot shows Mr Lehrman seated on a stool in shirtsleeves and suspenders Im Lew Lehrman  he begins earnestly He stutters then emits a growl of anger that merges into a laugh He spins off the stool and turns from the camera shaking his head and making an I blew it gesture Its a peek behind the cameras And it works New Yorkers may or may not vote for Mr Lehrman on Tuesday but they would probably recognize him on the street Hey a conductor on the Long Island Rail Road said somewhere west of Hicksville staring in momentary puzzlement at the familiar figure in an aisle seat youre the guy that fell off the stool

"FOR A CHANGE, A CLASH OF IDEAS AND INTELLECTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/31/weekinreview/for-a-change-a-clash-of-ideas-and-intellects.html,Whatever else turns out to be true of New Yorks 1982 campaign for governor it will have been a contest between two powerful stubborn and searching intellects with sharply contrasting ideas about how the world does and should work This is a campaign of ideas Lewis E Lehrman has said over and over and it has proven true not only of his race but also of that of his adversary Mario M Cuomo Voters will be faced on Tuesday with a stark ideological choice between Mr Cuomo the DemocraticLiberal and Mr Lehrman the RepublicanConservative  and for once the labels will mean what they say But the contestants do not just represent different philosophies each promises to be something of a philospher a shaper of ideas rather than a passive recipient of them Of course it is generally not a good thing in politics to be thought of as too intellectual and each candidate has resolutely fought the notion that he might be impractical which is how intellectuals are often regarded Mr Lehrman reminds people that he is an independent businessman of no small success Mr Cuomo says he is a longstanding practitioner of the science of governing who has experience money cant buy Still one cant help but feel that these are candidates who would be happier arguing about Marx Adam Smith and St Augustine than about the budget for the Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Yet if both are academic they are rooted in different disciplines Mr Lehrman is part economic theorist part business school teacher Mr Cuomo is a lawyer a sociologist a theologian For Mr Lehrman people are best thought of as rational competitive creatures who respond to incentives and should be left free to do so Mr Lehrman uses supplyanddemand analogies not only when he talks about the economy but also when he discusses crime It doesnt cost anything to commit a crime he said last week We know in business for example that when it costs nothing to produce a product and the reward for the product is rising the supply of the product and the supply of the producers of the product will also rise Thus high crime rates On economics Mr Lehrman is almost a libertarian If he could he would take the government out of nearly everything That can make conversations with the candidate very interesting For instance he responds with sympathy when presented with such ideas as opening the nations borders to all immigrants or eliminating punishment for victimless crimes such as prostitution He is enough of a politician not to take these positions  in the case of prostitution he thinks the community has an interest in keeping the streets free of those who solicit But he is too much a philosopher not to know that the logical implication of his attitude toward government is deregulation even in areas where it might be unpopular The one place Mr Lehrman does not sound like a libertarian is when he talks about the rights of the accused and the death penalty To him there is no inconsistency It takes a limited state that is strong to protect free people he says In his world government would impose few rules but woe unto those who would disobey them Mario Cuomo is quite another case For him the guiding principle is the New Testament injunction to love The purpose of government he once said is to make love real in a sinful world Another word for love is charity and thats how Mr Cuomo sees the role of the state  it helps people decide to do good things that they might not get around to doing as individuals Mr Cuomos intellectual system is not as tidy as the one that gives rise to Mr Lehrmans spare vision of the state Both Mr Cuomo and Mr Lehrman believe in incentives and both believe that tax cuts can create jobs But while Mr Lehrman sees taxes as largely pernicious Mr Cuomo sees them as part and parcel of his charitable state And while Mr Lehrman sees almost all limits on business as a threat to prosperity and freedom Mr Cuomo believes businesses like people sometimes have to be forced to do what is right If what is important to Mr Lehrman is getting to a clearly defined place as quickly as possible Mr Cuomo believes it is more pragmatic as he says to chart a general direction In his world the ultimate goals are elusive We cant make it perfect he says We can make it better Mr Cuomo gets irate when it is suggested that believing in the welfare state means he believes in welfare cheats  they should go to jail he says Nor does he find an unbalanced budget appealing And he says there is nothing about his view of charity that precludes being tough on crime But the lawyer in Mr Cuomo makes him deeply skeptical of attempts to curb defendants constitutional rights It can also make him remarkably legalistic He gets angry when Mr Lehrman says the Democrat is for unrestricted abortion and Mr Cuomo bases his case on the fact that when the United States Supreme Court ruled on abortion it distinguished between the first second and third trimesters of pregnancy The complicated views of these candidates make normal political sloganeering somewhat beside the point It is Mr Lehrman the conservative who describes himself as the candidate of change and Mr Cuomo the liberal who accuses Mr Lehrman of being a radical Mr Lehrman says he doesnt like Mr Cuomos use of that word but when asked why the Republican establishment in New York was cool to him he has said Lenin wasnt welcomed into Petrograd Through their relentless emphasis on fear  of crime and of joblessness  the candidates have sometimes obscured the richness of their positions And the campaign of ideas has not precluded personal attacks or ethnic appeals Still many voters seem to be relishing the chance to choose between the two candidates The latest New York Times Poll gave both Mr Lehrman and Mr Cuomo very high approval ratings suggesting that even in politics there are worse things to be than intellectual
SOCIAL ISSUES PLAY SMALL ELECTION ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/01/us/social-issues-play-small-election-role.html,Last week President Reagan shared a campaign platform with Senator Jesse Helms hero of the New Right and leading Congressional advocate of such social issues as abortion and school prayer But in a fourpage speech the President mentioned these issues only once When asked about this later Larry Speakes the deputy White House press secretary said that the emphasis should be on economic issues because they dominate the attention of the voters Mr Reagans North Carolina appearance demonstrates how dramatically the social issue agenda and its advocates have faded Although Mr Reagan raised the school prayer issue today again in denouncing the Democrats in no more than a handful of races are such issues playing prominent roles The social issues have not played a major part one way or another in any Senate race said Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee Lower Impact Seen by Both The National Conservative Political Action Committee which took credit for defeating half a dozen liberal Democrats two years ago has had minimal impact this fall according to analysts in both parties After the 1980 elections the committee announced that it would target 20 incumbent Democrats but it has now given up on all but six races Most analysts think only tw targets Senators John Melcher of Montana and Howard Cannon of Nevada are in any trouble Ray Strother a campaign consultant for Democrats said in reference to the conservative action committee We were really worried about Nickpack but I think theyre finished for a while Their credibility has been badly questioned Some analysts however are not so quick to write an obituary for the New Right Anthony Podesta executive director of People for the American Way which monitors conservative political activity warned that people are not paying enough attention to rightwing campaign efforts this year For instance he said Moral Majority a religious fundamentalist group mailed out 500000 fundraising letters this fall soliciting support for a lastminute telephone campaign to back prolife protraditional family and proschool prayer candidates Report Card Distributed Christian Voice another key element of the religious right has distributed a report card to thousands of churchgoers grading Congressmen on moral issues The Fund for a Conservative Majority is spending almost 3 million on television commercials featuring encomiums to President Reagan and attacks on Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House In New York Lewis E Lehrman the Republican candidate for governor is leaning heavily on his support for the death penalty a favorite cause of the New Right In Tennessee Robin L Beard a Republican is emphasizing that the man he seeks to unseat in the Senate Jim Sasser voted to kill a proposal by Senator Helms that would have virtually banned all abortions But these candidates who are trailing their opponents are the exceptions this year and the main reason is the one mentioned by Mr Speakes the overwhelming importance of the economy Its hard said a campaign adviser to many conservative Republicans to get people to focus on the social issues when theyre out of work or they cant find the money for kids college Fear of Abortion Issue Gone Moreover proponents of the social issues suffered a series of defeats in Congress this year and their aura of political potency has been diminished As a result candidates are no longer so afraid of opposing Senator Helms and his allies particularly on abortion The rightwing position on abortion is a minority position even among Catholics said the adviser to conservative candidates How do you build a majority around that The furor over school busing has really faded around the country he said in part because the Reagan Administration is no longer pursuing school discrimination cases with much vigor The issue of school prayer commands widespread support but legislation to overturn Supreme Court decisions is vulnerable to charges that it violates the balance of powers in the Constitition Moreover conservative activists fault the Reagan Administration for shifting ground and abandoning pure principle in the face of political reality One result they say has been disillusion among the rightwing stalwarts A lot of components of the conservative coalition are not as active this year as they were in 1980 said Bob McAdam assistant director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress an important link in the rightwing network here Theyve found out that being involved in politics is not such a great deal after all Blurring of Message Seen Joe Steffen a spokesman for the National Conservative Political Action Committee said that the more pragmatic attitudes in the Reagan White House had blurred the message of the right wing In 1980 we would echo each other Mr Steffen noted but this year things have changed With Mr Reagan in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate the conservatives are having trouble stirring up a belief that there is a moral mess in Washington Its always a lot easier to attack from the outside looking in than to defend a record conceded Mr Steffen But even though the social issues played a small role in the current campaign liberals expect a renewed assault from the right wing come January when the new Congress convenes

withdrawal from Lebanon must be preceded by an evacuation of Israeli forces and the signing of a new agreement between the guerrilla group and the Lebanese Government guaranteeing the safety of Palestinian civilians the PLOs senior military commander said Khalil alWazir widely known by his guerrilla name Abu Jihad said that the PLO wanted to retain some kind of symbolic military presence in Lebanon under the authority of the Lebanese Government He said this would assure the 500000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon that they would not be exposed to another massacre such as occurred

POPE ARRIVES IN MADRID ON VISIT; PLANNING TRIP TO RESTLESS REGIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/01/world/pope-arrives-in-madrid-on-visit-planning-trip-to-restless-regions.html,Pope John Paul II stepped off an airliner onto Spanish soil today for the start of the first visit by any Pope to this predominantly Roman Catholic nation The Pope is beginning his 10day pastoral journey at a time of high political excitement in Spain which only Wednesday elected its first Socialist government in nearly half a century Because Felipe Gonzalez the Socialist leader has not yet been installed as Prime Minister the Pope was greeted on behalf of the Government by the outgoing Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo King Juan Carlos accompanied by Queen Sofia was the first to salute the Pope as he stepped from the plane at the airport outside the capital Pope Notes Tensions The Pope in reply to welcoming remarks by the King recalled the wellknown tensions sometimes leading to open clashes which have taken place in the bosom of your society But he went on my journey is beyond any political or partisan purpose The Pope will nonetheless confront some of Spains major political problems when he visits in the course of an exceptionally long foreign trip the Basque and Catalan regions where autonomist and even separatist movements are strong and Andalusia in the south a traditionally impoverished area Unemployment is running high throughout the country Warm Welcome on Drive The Pope was warmly received on his drive through the capital after a restrained welcome by a carefully limited crowd at the airport The Pope is expected to make statements on the political problems at appropriate moments as he meets with farmers industrial workers students and intellectuals as well as Mr Gonzalez and other political personalities He confined his remarks today largely to religious matters But in a subsequent address to the Spanish bishops he urged them to defend the church positions against abortion and divorce The new Government is widely expected to move for the legalization of abortion Kings Welcoming Remarks The King in his welcoming remarks recalled that since 1494 Spains Kings and Queens had borne the title Los Reyes Catolicos conferred upon them by the papacy and noted that the Pope had already seen the consequences of Spains spreading of the Catholic gospel in America the Philippines and Africa The King did not mention that in the years since Francisco Franco died in 1975 the Catholic church in Spain has lost a great deal of its power A new Constitution has for the first time separated church from state a fact later enshrined in a new concordat with the Vatican A sweeping liberalization of public life including the right to divorce has excluded the church from much of the position of official guardian of public morality that it occupied through the centuries Election Delayed Visit The Popes visit was postponed from earlier this month when elections were called for last Wednesday The parties of the left protested that the Popes presence during the campaign would give unfair advantage to the parties to their right The visit was originally planned for last year but was put off after the Pope had been wounded by a Turkish gunman in May 1981 Liberal Spanish church sources in Rome stressed that the Pope was visiting the country at a moment when the Socialist election victory had underlined the churchs loss of influence on public affairs Parish priests are known to have communicated the churchs lack of enthusiasm for the leftwing parties during the campaign advice that was clearly ignored Recent statistics compiled by Spanish church sources indicate that 82 percent of a population of 375 million list themselves as Catholics 52 percent say they practice Catholicism Eleven percent define themselves as nonbelievers  Bomb Kills Policeman VITORIA Spain Oct 31 AP  A bomb explosion killed one policeman and wounded five tonight in this Basque city the national news agency EFE reported It said no one took responsibility for the attack but Basque guerrillas have been waging a terrorist campaign for years in an effort to gain autonomy for the Basque region in northern Spain

TV NOTEBOOK; NBC RATINGS HURTING TOM SNYDER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/01/arts/tv-notebook-nbc-ratings-hurting-tom-snyder.html,FOR the second time in less than a year Tom Snyder is suffering at the hands of NBCTV In December NBC unceremoniously replaced Mr Snyders Tomorrow with Late Night With David Letterman That left Mr Snyder without a job In September amid great fanfare Mr Snyder returned to local news as anchor of WABCTVs toprated Eyewitness News at 11 PM In the weeks since then the program has plummetted to third place Who has taken over the lead WNBCTV whose newscast has been buoyed by the strength of the networks primetime schedule which is running first in New York even as it struggles in second and third place elsewhere During October according to AC Nielsen WNBCs 11 PM news averaged a 24 percent share of the audience compared with a 21 for WCBSTV and an 18 for WABCTV That represents a decline of 4 share points for WABC compared with the same preSnyder period last October That has to be bittersweet news to Ernie Anastos and Rose Ann Scamardella the team WABC dropped to make room for Mr Snyder The strength of WNBCs 11 PM newscast will depend in part on whether the networks primetime programs which lead audience into the news continue to demonstrate more appeal in urban than in rural areas For the month of October NBC led ABC by 4 share points and CBS by 5 in New York Nationally NBC trailed CBS by 1 point and led ABC by 2 Perhaps the most interesting local audiencepopularity ratings story for October is the extraordinary disparity between the figures compiled by Nielsen and those by Arbitron the other major ratings service Critics have long complained that when it comes to local ratings which the two services base on a very small sample of homes the data are inexact at best Consider this months evidence According to Nielsen WNBCs Live at 5 achieved a 16 share of the audience last month according to Arbitron WNBCs share was 11 On Oct 5 the 11 PM news on WCBS achieved a 32 share according to Nielsen but a 27 share according Arbitron And on Oct 21 Nielsen found that WABCs 5 PM news attracted a 16 share Arbitron put the share at 21 Not even standard sampling error can account for those differences Why was the Rev Jerry Falwells Old Time Gospel Hour which ran Sundays at 9 AM on WPIXTV suddenly replaced by cartoons last month And why will it return to the air in September Therein lies a quirky tale of how the programming game is played on an independent commercial station At first the departure of Mr Falwells show seemed as if it might have been an effort to head off a brewing controversy On several occasions during the last several months Mr Falwell has attacked Planned Parenthood on his Gospel Hour charging that the organization was attempting to influence womens decisions about pregnancy and abortion We felt that Mr Falwells comments were hostile derogatory and grossly unfair Alfred Moran the director of Planned Parenthood of New York said and we asked WPIX to give us equal time to explain what we stood for Under the Fairness Doctrine a station must provide reasonable opportunity for opposing viewpoints to be heard The catch is that the producers of the Gospel Hour pay 11000 a week for their hour The program does not carry advertising If WPIX agreed that Planned Parenthood deserved time the station would have had to provide it at no charge Instead WPIX executives countered that the station had fulfilled its obligation by putting Planned Parenthood officials on a WPIX publicaffairs program and carrying its publicservice announcements But last month the dispute became academic Both The Old Time Gospel Hour and Ever Increasing Faith a religious program that directly preceded it were replaced by cartoons WPIX denied that Planned Parenthood had had any influence It was Martin Appel a WPIX spokesman said an ordinary commercial decision an effort on our part to try to improve our audience share on Sunday morning But then why will the two religious programs return in midDecember The answer is twofold First November is a key sweeps month the ratings for which determine how much advertisers will pay for commercial time Cartoons attract much higher ratings than do religious programs and thus help increase WPIXs overall rating which in turn makes the station more attractive to advertisers The other answer is that the preChristmas season is a big time for toy advertising and what better spot for those spots than on a cartoon show After the Christmas season ends Mr Appel says the station can earn more money on Sunday mornings by selling the hour to Mr Falwell than it can by trying to attract advertisers for its own shows And what of Planned Parenthoods plans Well continue to push for equity exposure said Mr Moran What Mr Falwell says about the organization may not have much impact however Viewership for The Old Time Gospel Hour is so low it doesnt show up at all in the ratings The commercial networks may be losing audience but they must be cheered to see that their new programs do have some effect on competitors In July Home Box Office the leading pay television network achieved its highest share ever in homes that receive the service a healthy 22 During the next two months HBOs share in the same homes inched downward reaching an 18 in September when the networks begin running original programming And during October when all three major networks introduce their entire new fall programs the HBO share in subscriber homes was only a 13
THE OTHER DEFENDER OF THE CONSTITUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/01/opinion/l-the-other-defender-of-the-constitution-255865.html,To the Editor Your Oct 27 editorial endorsing Senator Weicker for reelection in Connecticut seems to us incomplete and unfair to the extent that it is based on his opposition to the bills that would strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction over abortion and schoolprayer cases v e commend Senator Weickers opposition to those bills particularly since they were initiated and supported by members of his own party in the Senate But the editorial is incomplete because it fails to note that the record of the Senators Democratic opponent Toby Moffett shows he would be at least as vigorous a defender of the constitutional principles at stake It is unfair because it does not note that Mr Moffett is a member of the House where filibusters are prohibited He therefore did not have the same visible opportunity to defend the Constitution that the Senator did We believe that Connecticut voters principally concerned with protecting the Constitution should be informed of these points We also note that control of the Senate as well as of the House may be critical in the next session in view of the other major attack on constitutional process led by President Reagan the budget balancing amendment which The Times has editorially condemned THOMAS I EMERSON BURKE MARSHALL New Haven Oct 28 1982 The writers are on the Yale Law School faculty
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/us/briefing-262085.html,Stay the Course Again S tay the course the phrase that President Reagan has adopted to persuade Americans to retain their faith in his program for economic recovery turns out to be a resilient slogan One of President Carters assistants in fact urged him to use the phrase which appeared in a major Carter speech as a theme in the 1980 Presidential campaign Mr Carter used the phrase three times in an address he made at the closing banquet of the Bnai Brith convention in Washington on Sept 4 1980 Our country is on the right road to the right future Mr Carter said and we will stay the course A moment later in a reference to the Middle East he said the United States would stay the course no matter how difficult it might be in our commitment to justice and peace and to the security and the wellbeing of Israel Alfred H Moses the Carter aide who wrote the speech thought the cadence of the phrase suited Mr Carter well I thought it would be great for him said Mr Moses a Washington lawyer and I thought it would really catch on Looking for Work I t may be another year before the case of Timothy L Donohoe Washington lobbyist is concluded Last January Mr Donohoe the Washington representative for the Enserch Corporation a Dallas energy concern found himself at the center of a national cause celebre over an letter he wrote to Interior Secretary James G Watt He was dismissed by Enserch after he wrote Mr Watt as a private citizen to seek clarification of the Secretarys statement that Washington was more a city of liberals and Americans than of Democrats and Republicans He then filed a 4 million suit against his employer and the Interior Department but his action was dismissed when Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found that his First Amendment rights had not been violated and ruled that the Interior Departments transmission of Mr Donohoes letter to the chief executive of Enserch was an appropriate official function Mr Donohoe has appealed and according to Lawrence Speiser his attorney is out looking for a job No Hard Feelings I t may not be the onset of a new Era of Good Feelings in the capital but an era of no hard feelings has dawned among former high Government officials At the dawn of new careers in fact Republicans and Democrats often are managing to put aside their political differences The latest example comes from the Washington consulting firm of Wexler and Associates headed by Anne Wexler the former assistant to President Carter for public liaison Beginning in January the concern will include Nancy Clark Reynolds the vice president for national affairs of the Bendix Corporation She is a close associate of Nancy Reagan and was a special assistant to Governor Ronald Reagan in California for eight years Progressive Broadcasters N ew right groups and conservative religious broadcasters have had great success bringing their messages to the airwaves and now a group espousing a progressive outlook is flexing its broadcast muscles The group which includes Voice of America personnel is known as the National Progressive Broadcast Coalition and seeks to take a nonpartisan educational and progressive approach to public issues It already has aired a number of spots in the Washington area A sample If the air in Washington gets too dirty to breathe President Reagan can always go to his ranch in the mountains But wheres your ranch Like most Americans you cant just walk away from polluted air and water Other broadcasts have dealt with such issues as nuclear arms abortion handgun legislation and school prayer Were trying to counter the misinformation coming from the other side said Richard Deutsch a VOA employee and a director of the group They tend to emphasize certain facts on these issues and we emphasize other facts David Shribman Warren Weaver Jr
What the Election Is Not About,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/opinion/what-the-election-is-not-about.html,They says President Reagan at the end of the campaign even drove prayer out of our nations classrooms Who are They and in any case what does forced prayer in public schools have to do with todays election A White House spokesman explains only that They know who they are so were left with no idea of whom Mr Reagan means Weve always thought that They were the Founding Fathers  who banned the official establishment of religion precisely to keep religion out of politics This election is not about school prayer nor should it be Its not like the kindergarten class which unable to decide the sex of its pet hamster voted on it School prayer is a sober constitutional question and for the President thus to throw it into the campaign is to throw matches Neither is this election about Social Security at least not in any responsible sense The Democrats have been waving the bloody pension check claiming that as soon as the election is safely past the President wants to reduce your benefits The Republicans counter with kindlyoldpostman commercials suggesting that only the President can save the elderly from the poorhouse In truth to put Social Security in the black requires either lowering benefits or raising taxes There are many ways to manage that with very different implications for both taxpayers and beneficiaries But no one in this campaign has been willing to move beyond demagoguery Neither is the election about other social issues like abortion or school busing They are issues capable of exciting passion in many citizens  but not in this campaign As a Republican campaign adviser told Steven Roberts of The Times Its hard to get people to focus on the social issues when theyre out of work or they cant find the money for kids college Ronald Reagan rang an echoing bell in 1980 when he asked Are you better off than you were four years ago Under President Carter the inflation side of the seesaw shot almost straight up and so did prices Now it has plunged from 14 percent to 5 while the other side of the seesaw has catapulted upward At the end of the Carter Administration there were 79 million unemployed in September there were 113 million Are you better off than you were two years ago For the millions more who are now out of work obviously not But even for those who remain employed the answer is not necessarily yes The decline in inflation is much more dramatic statistically than in prices still uncomfortably high Will the voters reject Republicans this time as decisively as they rejected Democrats last time Perhaps not For one thing everybody has to make car or mortgage payments inflation affects most people at least to a shallow extent Unemployment hurts fewer if much more deeply For all the nattering about school prayer and sloganeering about Social Security this is what the election is about good economic management Since the Democrats dont offer a coherent alternative program they may not gain so much Ronald Reagan still seems to retain more popularity than Reaganomics and hence may not lose so much Either way the problem of how to stabilize the seesaw will remain
"ON L.I., MRAZEK SCORES A VICTORY OVER INCUMBENT",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/nyregion/on-li-mrazek-scores-a-victory-over-incumbent.html,Representative John LeBoutillier Republican of Westbury LI considered one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives was defeated yesterday by a Democratic Suffolk County legislator Robert J Mrazek of Centerport With 84 percent of the vote counted in the Third Congressional District Mr Mrazek was leading by 10000 votes In one of the two races in the New York delegation between incumbents Representative Guy V Molinari Republican of Staten Island defeated Representative Leo C Zeferetti Democrat of Brooklyn in the 14th District In the other contest between incumbents in the 22d District centered on Rockland County Representative Benjamin A Gilman Republican of Middletown withstood a challenge from Representative Peter A Peyser Democrat of Irvington With 80 percent of the vote counted Mr Gilman led by almost 20000 votes Upstate in the 28th District a fourterm Democratic incumbent Matthew F McHugh held off David F Crowley a wellknown Binghamton lawyer and former Broome County Republican Chairman The Democrats will retain their majority in the New York delegation despite the loss of Mr Peyser and Mr Zeferetti They will hold 19 seats and the Republicans 15 The delegation previously consisted of 22 Democrats and 17 Republicans Delegation Cut by Redistricting As a result of reapportionment the New York Congressional delegation has shrunk from 39 members to 34  its smallest in this century In 1890 there were 34 Representatives and by 1900 the delegation had grown to 37 members The new delegation will remain second in size to the California delegation which has increased by two to 42 Perhaps the most closely watched New York Congressional contest was between Mr LeBoutillier whom President Reagan recently praised as one of his most enthusiastic supporters and Mr Mrazek At his victory celebration at his campaign headquarters Mr Mrazek said the voters on the north shore of Long Island are among the most sophisticated in the country  they have clearly demonstrated their ability to split a ticket and demonstrated that they recognized the importance of our issues Favored Radio Advertising The Third District which straddles Nassau and Suffolk Counties has a 2to1 edge in Republican registration Mr Mrazek presented himself as a moderate Democrat on the economy and defense Environmental prochoice abortion and nuclearfreeze groups mounted drives to get out the vote for Mr Mrazek Because of a lack of funds the Democrat eschewed television advertisements in favor of radio messages which among other things questioned the legality of loans Mr LeBoutillier made to his 1980 campaign Mr LeBoutillier who at the age of 29 was the youngest member of the last Congress spent more than 350000 on the campaign the bulk of it on television commercials that depicted him as tough on crime and conservative on fiscal matters On Monday Mr LeBoutilliers chief campaign aide Christian N Braunlich predicted that the Republican would win though narrowly Gilman an Early Favorite Mr Gilman who had represented 60 percent of the new district since he entered Congress in 1972 started as the early favorite in the 22d District But Mr Peyser who carried the advantage of 18000 more Democratic voters among the 240000 registered voters worked hard at gaining recognition Mr Peyser a Republican until he switched parties in 1977 also held the Liberal Partys nomination Mr Peyser criticized Mr Gilmans support last year of Mr Reagans economic program and won the endorsements of most of the states labor unions which had previously backed the Republican Mr Gilman a member of the Gypsy Moth group of moderate Republicans who worked to reverse some of the Reagan Administrations domestic budget cuts emphasized his delivery of constituent services In the other contest between incumbents Mr Molinari carried the immediate advantage of having represented Staten Island where twothirds of the voters in the new district live Mr Zeferetti who was seeking a fourth term formerly represented the Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst sections of Brooklyn Molinaris Voting Record Cited Mr Zeferetti cited Mr Molinaris votes last year for the Reagan tax and budget cuts and emphasized his background as a former corrections officer who knew how to combat crime Mr Molinari had won respect in his district for his concern for the environment The Republicans campaign centered on his opposition to policies of the Environmental Protection Agency that he felt were weakening standards for a clean environment and his lawsuit against the Power Authority of the State of New York over its plan to build a generating plant on Staten Island In the 28th District which stretches from Ithaca to Binghamton and takes in parts of the Catskills Mr McHugh put up a spirited and wellfinanced campaign against Mr Crowley The Republican National Committee held high hopes for Mr Crowley a former Broome County Republican chairman In New York City Representative Bill Green a Republican was leading Betty G Lall a Democrat Mayor Koch a Democrat went out of his way to endorse Mr Green who has been considered a valuable advocate for the city in Washington Owens Election Was Expected Two new black Representatives won election Edolphus Towns the deputy Brooklyn borough president won the 11th District seat left vacant by the resignation of Frederick W Richmond State Senator Major R Owens confirmed by the Court of Appeals in Albany last week as the victor in the Democratic primary against State Senator Vander L Beatty will replace Shirley Chisholm as the Representative from the 12th District in Brooklyn Because of these two victories mean that the minority representation on the delegation which now includes two blacks and one Hispanic Representative will increase by one black Representative Another new member elected to Congress in the 25th District was the Oneida County Executive Sherwood L Boehlert a Republican from New Hartford He will fill the seat vacated by Representative Donald J Mitchell who retired In the energetically fought contest in the 20th District in Westchester County Richard L Ottinger the Democratic incumbent handily defeated his Republican challenger Jon S Fossel In the 34th District which includes

CIVIL RIGHTS ARE SAFER IN CONGRESS'S HANDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/opinion/civil-rights-are-safer-in-congress-s-hands.html,Congress and the Reagan Administration differ on the role of government in enforcing the Bill of Rights Debates on abortion school prayer voting rights legal services for the poor and other civil liberties issues have pitted the President against a surprisingly bipartisan civil libertarian majority in a Congress supposedly dominated by conservatives Sadly the Administration has found ways to circumvent the will of Congress on this front Efforts backed by the Administration to strip the Federal courts of their authority to use remedies such as busing in racial discrimination cases were blocked in Congress but a Justice Department bent on curtailing Federal civil rights enforcement has made steady progress toward its goal An executive branch determined to operate in greater secrecy failed to persuade the Congress to gut the Freedom of Information Act but the President by a stroke of his pen has instituted the broadest security classification system in United States history A valiant struggle on Capitol Hill saved the Legal Services Corporation from extinction but the availability of legal services for the poor has been drastically reduced by the Reagan budget cuts A reborn civil rights movement achieved passage of a strengthened Voting Rights Act but the Justice Department has been far less vigilant than its predecessors in protecting the right to vote The lesson to derive from all this is that in 1982 individual rights are safer in the hands of the Congress than they are in the hands of the Administration Last month attention focused on the failure of the political right led by Senator Jesse Helms to enact its legislative agenda on abortion and school prayer in defiance of the courts The defeat of the right on the Senate floor resulted from a consensus among moderates liberals and traditional conservatives such as Senator Barry Goldwater that legislation to tamper with the authority of the Federal judiciary would have a devastating impact on liberty in America Nevertheless the White House announced immediately after the Senate votes that it would continue to push the social agenda of the far right in the next session of Congress This persistence in disregarding individual rights reflects the fact that many policies of the Reagan Administration call for a profound shift in the traditional relationship between government and the individual Contrary to Mr Reagans Presidentialcampaign slogan Get government off the backs of the people the Administration has supported official intrusion into private lives in its widely publicized policies on abortion prayer and domestic spying by the Central Intelligence Agency Less widely known is the Administrations position on the privacy of income tax records The President supports legislation that would allow the use of private income tax records for purposes other than the enforcement of tax laws Thats not to say the Administration hasnt kept any of its promises to reduce the role of government in our lives unfortunately it has made good on its promise to retreat from the enforcement of Federal laws against discrimination on the basis of race or sex The most dramatic and hardwon civil liberties victories in Congress this year were in defense of the Federal courts Not since President Franklin D Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court with extra Justices in 1937 has the integrity of the Federal judiciary come under such sweeping political attack More than 40 bills were introduced in the last two years to strip the courts of jurisdiction over constitutional issues on which they have handed down controversial decisions Not one was enacted into law For 15 months Congress conducted a farreaching debate on the meaning of the Constitution Can the national legislature dictate to the Federal courts Can a Congressional majority take away the constitutional rights of a minority Can the Constitution be changed merely by getting a simple majority of the Congress to pass a courtstripping bill without having to persuade supermajorities in the Congress and the state legislatures to adopt a constitutional amendment The very fact that the courts were protected by Congress showed that an autonomous judiciary has stronger political support than the far right would want us to believe In rejecting most of the antilibertarian initiatives put forward by the Reagan Administration and the far right Congress has shown that the President does not have a mandate to turn back three decades of progress on civil liberties and equal justice in America Failure by the Administration to understand this and its rigid refusal to change course means that the political stakes in 1983 will be very high and the battles of 1982 may well have to be fought all over again  John Shattuck is national legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union
PROSPECTS UNSURE FOR BONN OPPOSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/world/prospects-unsure-for-bonn-opposition.html,West Germanys opposition Social Democrats have embarked on a new and uncertain course with the designation of HansJochen Vogel the partys West Berlin leader to take over from Helmut Schmidt as its candidate for Chancellor in elections promised for next March After Mr Schmidt withdrew the swiftness with which party leaders selected Mr Vogel last week bespoke both a strong consensus behind him and an awareness that he has little time to project himself as an alternative to Chancellor Helmut Kohl For the Social Democrats the 56yearold Mr Vogels greatest strength his record of trying to reconcile the partys mainstream with its vocal left wing It is a talent that will be sorely tested as the Social Democrats seek a common policy for dealing with the Green antinuclear movement In an interview last month in West Berin Mr Vogel said the Social Democrats should adopt an eventempered attitude toward the Greens who in recent state elections have confirmed their position as the countrys thirdstrongest political force We have to take these people seriously Mr Vogel said and not handle them as outcasts As the partys candidatedesignate Mr Vogel has reiterated these views insisting that in West Berlin the Alternative List as the Greens are known there had to a remarkable degree committed itself to the parliamentary process and was capable of constructive legislative work Schmidt Counsels Caution These words seem to echo the position of Willy Brandt the 68yearold Social Democratic Party chairman who has spoken of a new majority that would amount to an alliance with the Greens and dissident Free Democrats upset by their partys switch to Mr Kohls Christian Democrats But the wooing of the Greens whether merely to steal their voters or to enlist them in a coalition has met with a warning from Mr Schmidt One shouldnt roll out any red carpets to them the former Chancellor cautioned this week because its not clear what theyll do with them For 12 years Mr Vogel was Munichs extremely popular Mayor  he was first elected at the age of 34 and in 1966 received 78 percent of the vote In that time he acquired a reputation as a party rightwinger because of his battles with the Social Democrats left wing there Anger and frustration with party leftists led him to leave the southern city in 1972 having succeeded in attracting the Olympics to Munich that year Appointed Justice Minister by Chancellor Schmidt in 1974 the Roman Catholic Mr Vogel pushed through liberalizing laws on divorce and abortion and led the successful campaign to remove the statute of limitations for Nazi war criminals He Moved to Berlin in 1981 In the late 1970s when the country was shaken by farleft terrorism the Justice Minister impressed colleagues by taking a firm line against the violence without succumbing to demands for outright repression In 1977 Chancellor Schmidt reportedly planned to step down and name Mr Vogel his successor if the storming of a terroristheld Lufthansa jet in Somalia ended in a bloodbath In January 1981 Mr Vogel was sent to West Berlin to rescue the local Social Democratic organization which had been discredited and demoralized by a financial scandal that had forced the resignation of Mayor Dietrich Stobbe As Mayor Mr Vogel developed the socalled Berlin line of a certain tolerance toward the lively youth and squatter movement in the city But Mr Vogel was unable in such a short time to reverse the partys fortunes and in elections in May 1981 the West Berlin Social Democrats lost control of city hall to the Christian Democrats for the first time since 1954 As opposition leader in West Berlin Mr Vogel will be handicapped by being unable to challenge Chancellor Kohl on the floor of Parliament thereby losing valuable television coverage If Mr Kohl follows through on his pledge to dissolve Parliament for elections on March 6 Mr Vogel will seek one of Berlins seats which have no vote in full meetings of Parliament because of the citys occupied status He Faces Uphill Fight The son of a university professor Mr Vogel has a bit of Mr Schmidts cosmopolitan and intellectual aloofness but a warmer and less biting sense of humor A Catholic and a Bavarian southerner in a party that is strongest in the Protestant north Mr Vogel faces an uphill struggle against Mr Kohls Christian Democrats Opinion polls put the Chancellors conservative party close to an absolute majority Asked if he thought he was being sacrificed for a hopeless election campaign Mr Vogel responded That sounds too much like martyrdom and I dont see it that way myself The candidates brother Bernhard a Christian Democrat is Premier of Chancellor Kohls home state of RhinelandPalatinate he sent his Social Democratic sibling a humorous congratulatory telegram warning him as a new driver to beware of a car that isnt roadworthy an allusion to the Social Democrats Dear brother answered Mr Vogel Dont worry about the car Better a reliable oldtimer than a racing car with an outofshape passenger a counterallusion to the Christian Democratic Party and its new ally Deputy Prime Minister HansDietrich Genscher whose reputation has suffered since he quit Mr Schmidts Cabinet in September
"POPE, IN SPAIN, CONDEMNS ALL ABORTIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/world/pope-in-spain-condemns-all-abortions.html,Pope John Paul II cheered by a crowd estimated at more than one million condemned divorce and abortion today in terms of exceptional force The Pope was speaking in the heart of a capital that only last year legalized divorce and whose newly elected governing party has committed itself to liberalizing the law that prohibits any abortion Earlier in the day at the royal palace the Pope had warmly shaken hands with Felipe Gonzalez who will become Prime Minister early next month when the Socialists form a Cabinet after their victory in last weeks elections Speaking at a mass dedicated to Christian families at a plaza in downtown Madrid the Pope put forward the traditional position of the church on marriage and the family without adding anything new But he did so in language stronger than he has used for some time and he was repeatedly interrupted by resounding applause when he allowed his voice to rise in emphasis He spoke in Spanish that bore the mark of his native Polish but he was clearly understood Matrimony is an indissoluble communion of love the Pope said Therefore any attack on conjugal indissolubility is at the same time against the original design of God and the dignity and truth of conjugal love Assails Socialists on Abortion Although on his arrival Sunday the Pope stressed the strictly pastoral nature of his 10day visit and appeared to forswear a voice in political matters he called on Catholics to live in indissoluble unions even in the presence of legal norms that may point in another direction Turning to birth control the Pope quoted his predecessor Paul VI who said Every conjugal act must remain open to the transmission of life It was on abortion which the Socialists said they would liberalize to save the womans life if endangered or if the fetus appeared abnormal or if pregnancy was the result of rape that the Pope issued his sternest condemnation I speak on the absolute respect for human life which no person or institution private or public can ignore he declared Therefore whoever denies defense to the most innocent and frailest human person to the human person conceived but not yet born commits a most grave violation of moral order Nothing can legitimize the death of an innocent What sense can there be in speaking of the dignity of man of his fundamental rights if one does not protect the innocent if one goes as far even as to facilitate means and services private or public to destroy defenseless human lives the Pope continued Cites Spanish Constitution The Pope also spoke strongly on the inalienable duty and right of parents to see to it that their children receive an education in accordance with their moral and religious convictions As if to put the new Government on guard John Paul quoted the section of the Spanish Constitution that grants this right The Socialist Party has not contested this during the election campaign although some Spaniards expect a review of the amount of Government subsidies paid to Catholic schools In a day devoted to meetings in Madrid with King Juan Carlos and the outgoing Government and other political leaders with the diplomatic corps and religious groups the Pope used an encounter with leading figures in Spanish journalism to deliver another strong message against what he deems a decline in general moral standards Asking the editors to think in terms of their public such as their own children he put them on guard against journalism that does not edify does not uplift but delivers a degrading idea of man and his dignity in the name of sexual permissiveness fashionable ideology outdated antireligious criticism and a certain tolerance for phenomena like violence
"News Summary; THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1982",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/nyregion/news-summary-thursday-november-4-1982.html,The 1982 Elections Democrats widened their majority in the House by 26 votes Tuesday in an election that raised doubts about President Reagans ability to protect his conservative economic program from alteration by Congress The Republicans retained firm control of the Senate but White House strategists estimated that the election had cut about 24 conservatives from the bipartisan coalition that helped pass Mr Reagans key economic legislation Page A1 Column 6 President Reagan was conciliatory about the sizable Republican losses in the House and predicted that both he and the Democrats would have to make concessions and compromises on major issues A15 Democrats wrested effective control of the House from the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats Congressional leaders of both parties confirmed Were going to be at the mercy of Tip was the reaction of Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the House Republican leader in a reference to Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts A191 Senate Republican leaders predicted that the election results would placethem in the difficult role of mediating between the conservative Republican White House and the increasingly liberal Democratic House A1916 Democrats also gained seven governorships in returns that have potentially significant implications for President Reagans effort to promote his new federalism plan to the states and for the 1984 Presidential election The Democrats won 27 of the 36 governorships at stake A1813 The newly elected Congress will be more inclined than the existing one to reduce scheduled increases in military spending more opposed to trimming social programs and differs more with President Reagan on a broad range of issues from abortion to a global nuclear freeze according to a New York TimesCBS News survey For example 50 of 77 incoming Representatives said they were in favor of canceling the scheduled 1983 cut in Federal income tax rates A135 A global nuclear freeze was urged by the voters in eight states and several major cities which together contain about onefourth of the countrys population The resolution is opposed by the Reagan Administration on the ground that such a policy would damage national security A2246 Lewis E Lehrman conceded defeat in the close race for Governor of New York Speaking at a midafternoon news conference Mr Lehrman the RepublicanConservative candidate warmly congratulated Mario M Cuomo his DemocraticLiberal opponent and said he would remain in public life and seek office again A11 Mario M Cuomo was aided by the unemployment and other economic issues in winning election as New Yorks 52d Governor But politicians and consultants on both sides attributed the narrowness of his victory to a reemergence of the crime issue in the final week of the campaign and an unprecedented barrage of television advertising and mailings by his millionaire opponent B856 California bucked the national trend by electing Republicans to major offices George Deukmejian the state Attorney General dashed the bid by Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles to become the first black in the nation to bw elected governor and Mayor Pete Wilson of San Diego defeated Gov Edmund C Brown

REAGAN FACING DEMANDS FOR COMPROMISE ON ECONOMY AFTER 26-SEAT LOSS IN HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/us/reagan-facing-demands-for-compromise-on-economy-after-26-seat-loss-in-house.html,Business executives said the election results may have reversed the conservative flow of the Administrations economic policies Pragmatism and bipartisanship on economic matters in Congress seemed to be the most likely effect of Tuesdays balloting Page D1 The Democrats expanded their majority in the House of Representatives by 26 votes Tuesday in an election that raised doubts about President Reagans ability to protect his conservative economic program from alteration by Congress But the Republicans retained firm control of the Senate providing what White House spokesmen described as a United States and regional election tables pages A20 and B910 foundation on which Mr Reagan could build a new more modest governing coalition Mr Reagan speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden sounded a conciliatory note in the wake of an election that by the private estimates of White House strategists removed about 24 conservatives from the delicately balanced bipartisan coalition that helped pass Mr Reagans key economic legislation Vowing that he would not bargain on principle Mr Reagan nonetheless said he was willing to work in a bipartisan fashion to solve the major problems that still have to be solved A Disastrous Defeat The White House chief of staff James A Baker 3d insisted that Mr Reagan would yet be able to muster a House majority from time to time But Richard Richards chairman of the Republican National Committee acknowledged that the President would be forced to accept more compromises because the election weakened both the Republicans standing in Congress and their nationwide political base It was a disastrous defeat for the President said House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr the Massachusetts Democrat who led his partys nationwide assault on Mr Reagans plan to stay the course with his economic policy despite the national unemployment rate of 101 percent Congressional leaders in both parties said the elections had given the Democrats effective control of the House Page A19 The Democrats also won 27 of the 36 governorships at stake building a firm power base for their ticket in the 1984 Presidential election and confounding Republican hopes of holding the Democrats to a gain of five governorships Page A18 The current lineup of 27 Democratic and 23 Republican governors will be altered to give the Democrats a greater edge with the race in Illinois still undecided they had 34 governorships to 15 for the Republicans By the measure of postWorld War II history the Republican setback in the House exceeded the average loss of 10 seats suffered by a party in its first offyear election after capturing the White House But late returns from the West and other areas kept the Democratic gains from being as large as they initially appeared on the basis of early returns from the recessionravaged areas of the Middle West and South In those regions according to officials of both parties union members blacks and Social Security recipients turned out a heavy vote against Republicans identified with Mr Reagans policies In the House where 218 seats are necessary for control the Democrats went into the election with 241 seats As a result of Tuesdays voting they have won 267 including three contests where they hold strong leads In addition Democratic candidates are favored in two delayed Congressional races to be held in Georgia Nov 30 GOP Losses in House So far on the basis of the elections Republican House membership has dropped to 165 from 192 A Republican is leading in one undecided race In the Senate the lineup has not changed greatly from the current 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats including an independent who caucused with the Democrats After the voting the Republicans held 53 seats the Democrats 46 The Senate contest in Rhode Island between John H Chafee the Republican incumbent and Julius C Michaelson a Democrat had not been decided In the main the Senate races were more a demonstration of the power of incumbency than a test of the popularity of Mr Reagans programs Of the 30 incumbents who sought reelection only two Howard W Cannon Democrat of Nevada and Harrison Schmitt Republican of New Mexico were defeated Effect of Reagan Visits Mr Richards the Republican chairman said the elections results did not damage the Presidents personal base of popularity and he maintained that the Presidents campaigning in 13 states helped Republican candidates But the fate of candidates in five of the 13 states where Mr Reagan campaigned called that conclusion into question Significant Republican defeats followed Mr Reagans appearances in North Carolina Nebraska New Mexico New Jersey and Texas Mr Richards singled out the defeat of Gov William Clements of Texas the Republican incumbent as perhaps the Republicans most surprising and upsetting loss of the election But Mr Reagans lastminute appearances were also unable to bail out Senator Schmitt in New Mexico and William Cobey a North Carolina House candidate who was rated a certain winner by the White House In New Jersey Frank R Lautenberg the Democratic senatorial candidate scored an upset despite Mr Reagans campaign appearance for Representative Millicent Fenwick a popular Republican Surprise at White House White House aides confessed to surprise not only at the outcome of such races but also at the size of the Democratic gains in general As late as election night the White House political office was telling Reagan aides to expect a House loss of only about 15 seats What Republicans identified as their most important victories the Senate and gubernatorial triumphs in California came after the President agreed to stay out of his home state so as not to polarize the election around the issue of his personal standing Both California contests were of national political consequence In the Senate contest Gov Edmund G Brown Jr a Democrat lost to Mayor Pete Wilson of San Diego Republican in in an effort to maintain his presence on the national political stage In the gubernatorial race the victory of George Deukmejian the Republican thwarted the attempt of Tom Bradley the Mayor of Los Angeles to become the first black to be elected governor of a state No Sweep for Democrats But of greater importance for the Republicans was the fact that Mr Deukmejians victory prevented Democrats from sweeping the governorships of the nations three largest states New York California and Texas From the outset Republican strategists had said such a sweep could be a heavy blow to their party and Mr Reagans political future Economic issues pushed social issues into the background in this election Antiabortion activists acknowledged that only one of 47 Senators whose votes displeased them was defeated But another special interest issue nuclear weapons rose to prominence Tuesday Voters in eight states and several major cities passed resolutions calling for a worldwide freeze on nuclear weapons In several states a variety of guncontrol and crime issues were on the ballot as well In California lobbyists spent 5 million to defeat a proposition calling for stricter control on pistols Situation in the States In state legislative elections the Democratic Party also expanded its political base Winning 10 legislative bodies formerly held by Republicans the Democrats increased to 34 from 28 the number of states in which they control both houses of the legislature Despite many early reports of apathy there were strong indications that voter turnout had increased If final totals show it did this would end a trend of declining participation that began just after World War II Curtis Gans who examines voting for the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate said turnout appeared to be up in about threefourths of the states and might have been just under 40 percent In 1978 378 percent of all votingage Americans went to the polls Total spending for Congressional candidates and their supporters was estimated at about 300 million making this the most expensive midterm election ever But several candidates including Lewis E Lehrman who spent 8 million of his personal wealth as the Republican gubernatorial candidate in New York found that heavy spending was no guarantee of success Winning and Losing Strategies But in the aftermath of the election it was the political balance of Congress and the winning and losing strategies that most engaged professional politicians The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee concurred with several Democrats who linked the outcomes to the Democrats success in pushing unemployment and related issues to the fore The economy and Social Security were the two big lastminute issues Mr Baker said The Democrats scared people to death Senator Bob Dole the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee called the elections a bath for his party and predicted the shifted balance in Congress would force Mr Reagan to be more pliant and force the Democrats to take greater responsiblity for national policies and problems The President will have to take some tradeoffs Senator Dole said He may have to take some things he wont like White House officials today argued that Mr Reagans conservative coalition had been reduced but not dismantled by the election One official said the pool of Republicans and conservative Democrats had been reduced to 245 from 269 meaning that is still numerically possible for Mr Reagan to get 218 votes a majority of the 435 members on a given issue
CRIME ISSUE CITED AS FACTOR IN STRONG LEHRMAN SHOWING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/nyregion/crime-issue-cited-as-factor-in-strong-lehrman-showing.html,Lieut Gov Mario M Cuomo in winning election as the 52d Governor of New York was aided by unemployment and the other economic issues that helped many Democrats Tuesday politicians and consultants on both sides agreed yesterday But what loomed as a substantial victory was reduced they said by the reemergence of the crime issue in the final week of the campaign and by an unprecedented barrage of television advertising and mailings by his millionaire opponent Lewis E Lehrman the RepublicanConservative candidate Following the electoral pattern of Governor Carey Mr Cuomo the DemocratLiberal rolled up usual Democratic majorities in New York City and ran nearly even in the normally Republican suburbs which countered Mr Lehrmans strong run upstate Mario is the populist who appeals to the traditional coalition of liberals labor and minorities but adds to that his appeal to Italian Americans and other Catholics who have tended to move toward the Republican Party  said Raymond B Harding the Liberal Party leader and a top Cuomo adviser Voters Zeroed In The crime issue kept on creeping up said Stanley Friedman the Democratic leader of the Bronx where crime is an acute problem The voters finally zeroed in on the death penalty and crime said State Senator Ralph J Marino Republican of Nassau County Crime has to have cut very heavily said another Republican Senator Roy M Goodman who is the Manhattan Republican chairman The 50yearold Mr Cuomo who won by 165000 votes will be the first Italian American Governor of the state and the first from Queens His Lieutenant Governor County Executive Alfred B DelBello of Westchester is also an Italian American There were also significant developments in the election which for the most part confirmed the present party division in both the executive and legislative branches of state government They were these  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Attorney General Robert Abrams achieved sweeping victories in all areas of the state with 65 percent of the vote and pluralities of about 14 million votes each They ran far ahead of Mr Cuomo Mr Abrams won all but six of the 62 counties Mr Moynihan all but 16  Mr DelBello apparently strengthened the showing of Mr Cuomo who won normally Republican Westchester County  something Governor Carey could not do even when he won the state by 808936 votes in 1974  State Comptroller Edward V Regan polled 57 percent of the vote and won all but four New York City boroughs for a total plurality of about 825000 He remains the only Republican elected state official  Assemblywoman Florence M Sullivan the Republican Conservative and Right to Life candidate for Senator and Frances A Sclafani the Republican candidate for Attorney General were the victims of the Moynihan and Abrams landslides Both were hurt by serious fundraising problems and a lack of statewide recognition The Liberal Party which had endorsed Mr Cuomo moved back into fourth place on the ballot a position that is determined by its balloting in the gubernatorial election But it polled only half the votes of the Conservative Party which had supported Mr Lehrman The Liberals also achieved a local victory when three Democrats and two Liberals were elected to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan on the Liberal line Democrats had no line because of a problems with their election filings Mr Cuomo won all boroughs of New York City and and two other counties Westchester and Albany He just lost normally Democratic Erie County where there is a 125 percent unemployment rate While Mr Cuomo ran well in the city he trailed far behind Mr Moynihan and Mr Abrams They won liberal West Side districts by up to a 9to1 margin while Mr Cuomo won by at best 5 to 1 In Jewish districts in Brooklyn Bronx and Queens they won by up to 5 to 1 compared with Mr Cuomos 2 to 1 margins and even in Italian districts they won by 3 to 1 compared with Mr Cuomos 2 to 1 Low Turnout for Minorities Black and Hispanic districts rolled up overwhelming pluralities as high as 10 to 1 for all three Democrats but the turnout in those districts was very low often from onehalf to onesixth of the vote in white districts The Right To Life candidate for Governor Robert Bohner polled barely 50000 votes to keep his party as an official state party Four years ago the antiabortion movement had qualified as a party and outpolled the Liberals by winning 130000 votes Mr Lehrman who was supported by a Right to Life Political Action Committee dug into Mr Bohners totals Two other of the Right to Life Partys statewide candidates ran considerably ahead of the top of their ticket The turnout was not as heavy as had been predicted At just over five million it was slightly higher than the last gubernatorial election in 1978 and nearly 500000 lower than 1974 Low turnout in minority districts in the city which went overwhelmingly for Mr Cuomo was another factor in the closeness of the race Mr Lehrmans strong showing was seen as likely to reinforce his efforts to remain active in the New York GOP It also tends to reinforce the conservative tilt of the Republican Party It was in a sense a victory for the right wing said Richard C Wade a historian Timothy Russert who managed Senator Moynihans landslide victory was one of several politicians who mentioned the impact of a blizzard of at least eight million pieces of Lehrman literature that blanketed the state in the last two weeks I firmly believe that direct mail had an enormous impact he said The huge Lehrman radio and television effort of at least 850000 in the last week was cited by Mr Cuomos media adviser Harvey Cohen Ive never seen a barrage like that they were buying up everything in sight Mr Cohen said Several politicians noted that this was the first New York campaign in which mailings came close to rivaling television commercials at least in the final days of the campaign Forced to make a choice most candidates opt for television but the wealthy Mr Lehrman could do both
NEW HOUSE SEEMS LESS IN TUNE WITH REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/us/new-house-seems-less-in-tune-with-reagan.html,According to a candidatebycandidate survey by The New York Times and CBS News the newly elected Congress will be more inclined than the current one to cut back scheduled increases in military spending more opposed to trimming domestic social programs and differs more with President Reagan on a full range of issues from abortion and the nuclear freeze to Social Security Fifty of the 77 freshmen members of the House of Representatives definitely elected Tuesday told The Times and CBS News responding to written questionaires sent to them before Election Day that they were in favor of canceling the scheduled 1983 cut in income tax rates so vigorously sought and defended by the President Fiftyfour also strongly opposed increasing the age for eligibility for Social Security benefits something Mr Reagan tested in 1981 Although it is impossible to predict precisely how the new members of Congress will vote on specific legislation their collective opinion in the survey sent to all Congressional candidates indicates that President Reagan will have considerably more difficulty in the next Congress in pulling together a legislative coalition unless he makes some compromises The survey underscores a modest ideological shift in the House toward more liberal positions reinforcing the specific election results where in California for example Phillip Burton a prominent Democratic liberal Congressman survived while John H Rousselot an outspoken conservative Republican was beaten There were similar symptoms of the new House in the victories of such former Congressmen as Bob Carr and Peter Kostmayer two Democratic liberals from Michigan and eastern Pennsylvania over Jim Dunn and Jim Coyne two conservative Republicans who had taken away their seats in the Reagan tide of 1980 Changes in South Particularly Moreover the TimesCBS News survey emphasized that even among southern Democrats an important element of the Reagan coalition in the current Congress there are now more moderates inclined to take less conservative positions on critical economic and budgetary issues than over the last two years The new climate and dynamics are most immediately obvious in the House The TimesCBS News poll indicated that there was virtually no ideological shift on major issues in the Senate where only two incumbents lost seats one from each party and where the three openseat races showed no net partisan change One factor that could not be measured was the political impact that Democratic gains in the House would have on incumbents who were reelected especially on Republicans who narrowly held their seats in campaigns in which they had deliberately put distance between themselves and the President on certain issues Youve got to count more than the seat switches youve got to consider the message from the voters Chris Matthews a spokesman for Thomas P ONeill Jr the House Speaker said For every Republican who has been beaten there is another one who barely skated through and who will not want to go again for those big budget packages Reagan Factor Welcomed Not only did the large majority of voters regard the election as a referendum on the issue of the Reagan economic program Democrats as well as Republicans welcomed this Reagan factor in their districts Half the Republicans elected Tuesday considered the existence of the Reagan issue an advantage and only 3 percent said it was a disadvantage But 40 percent of the Democrats also found the Reagan issue an advantage to them and only 5 percent called it a disadvantage underscoring the partisan mood of the new members In the survey the new crop of Congressmen not only showed greater disposition than the current ones to disagree with the President on his legislative agenda but also expressed less willingness to revise the Social Security system more tendency to enact protectionist legislation and greater hesitance to use American arms sales to Israel as a way to put on pressure on that nation to negotiate with the Palestinians These are all issues that could add to Mr Reagans problems in the future Perhaps the most graphic overall symptom of the ideological shift in the new House was in the tendency of the newcomers to disagree with the Presidents basic position on social and economic issues Proportion Who Disagree Rises The survey found that just under half of the current House members disagreed with Mr Reagan on six of nine major issues but in the new House that proportion rises to 55 percent This is because twothirds of the freshmen disagree with the President twothirds of the time The survey indicates that the White House will be especially disappointed in its expectation that the new Democratic Congressmen elected from the South would be just as conservative as the boll weevil Democrats who gave President Reagan crucial support in his budget and tax battles in 1981 and 1982 With at least a dozen new Democratic Congressmen from the South some from new districts and others elected in campaigns against conservative Republicans there is a distinct shift toward moderate positions on both economic and social issues In the 97th Congress a bare majority of the 79 Southern Democrats in the House were willing to oppose the 1983 Reagan tax cut but that proportion will grow to nearly twothirds in the next Congress Similarily a 56 percent majority of Southern Democrats in the new Congress favors going slower on increasing military spending whereas southern Democrats split roughly 5050 in the current Congress Trend on Social Issues A similar trend crops up on such controversial issues as the proposed Constitutional amendments to permit organized school prayer and to allow states to enact laws outlawing abortion where the support of Southerners in Congress has been crucial In the outgoing Congress 56 percent of the southern Democrats favored the prayer amendment but only 49 percent of the new group do On the abortion amendment the current Southerners are split evenly but the new Southern Democrats oppose that amendment by a ratio of 4 to 3 The trend noticed among the new Southern Congressmen generally followed the national pattern for the next Congress Sharpest Shifts Delineated Nationwide the sharpest shifts among the new freshman class of Congress from the prevailing views in the 97th Congress came on the 1983 tax cut military spending increases the nuclear freeze using arms sales to influence Israel on negotiations with the Palestinians and on various proposals for modifying the Social Security system With the proposal for an immediate nuclear freeze defeated 204 to 202 in August the 2to1 proportion in favor of a freeze among the new members tips the balance in the new House in favor of the freeze On the other issues the opinion of the new members does not immediately shift the majority from one side to another but it slims the proReagan margins For example while the current Congress favors keeping the 1983 Reagan tax cut by close to 60 percent to 40 percent 60 percent of the new members of Congress oppose that cutting the overall majority to 53 percent in the new House Similarly in the outgoing Congress 56 percent favor some increase in the eligibility age for Social Security benefits but that is opposed roughly 2 to 1 by the new members Even before the election the House was leaning 70 percent to 30 percent toward slowing the pace of military budget increases With new members tilting nearly 5 to 1 in that direction the new House would favor slowing the growth of the Pentagon budget by a ratio of 3 to 1 The survey also disclosed slightly higher preference for tougher rather than more relaxed Government regulations on air pollution though the great majority of members in both the old and the new Congress favors keeping the present level of regulation CHANGES TABLE FOR

DEMOCRATS REGAIN CONTROL IN HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/us/democrats-regain-control-in-house.html,The Democrats regained effective control of the House of Representatives by picking up at least 26 seats in Tuesdays elections according to Congressional leaders in both parties Were going to be at the mercy of Tip said Representative Robert H Michel the Republican leader who won a narrow victory in his Illinois district Its a heck of an obstacle to overcome every time Mr Michel was referring to Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House who said in an interview Theres no question that well have more of a voice than weve had in the last year and a half Democrats hold a margin of 241 to 192 votes with two vacancies on the Democratic side in the current 97th Congress but President Reagan and his allies were able to win most of the important fights by exacting strict loyalty from House Republicans and attracting several dozen conservative Democrats who have voted for Reagan Administration proposals At the White House James A Baker 3d the chief of staff acknowledged that the Administration faced a more difficult task on Capitol Hill but tried to paint the most optimistic picture possible Weve by no means lost that coalition he said 20 Was the Ceiling Even before the voting however White House aides privately admitted that if Republican losses topped 20 seats it would be very difficult for them to maintain their sway over the House Theres a new coalition whether the President likes it or not asserted Representative Tony Coelho of California head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Its not a conservative coalition its a moderate coalition And if the President is not agile enough to move with that coalition he will find Democrats and Republicans in Congress working without him Mr ONeill expressed a conciliatory attitude toward Congressional Republicans his old friends and seasoned politicians who know well the arts of compromise We dont want anyone to eat crow the Speaker said at a Washington news conference The country is in too tough shape for anything like that But he voiced some doubts that Mr Reagan who has never served in a legislative body and often takes a more ideological approach to problems would adapt to the new political realities on Capitol Hill Says President Must Listen The President has got to listen to reason said Mr ONeill who like all the Democratic leaders cruised to an easy victory Tuesday As a result of the election the Democrats won 267 seats including three in which they were leading The Republicans took 165 seats and were leading in one In addition two seats in Georgia where voting was delayed by redistricting disputes will be decided in a special election Nov 30 Both seats are expected to go Democratic The Democrats unseated at least 26 incumbent Republicans in fashioning their victory Their success cast considerable doubt on the argument that recent Republican gains among bluecollar workers Southern whites and Sun Belt refugees would form the basis for a new Republican majority in this country One key battleground this year was the industrial midsection of the country where many Republicans rode into office on Mr Reagans coattails two years ago but now faced voter discontent over unemployment and a sagging economy 4 Lost in Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania alone four Republicans lost their seats including Representative Eugene V Atkinson a former Democrat who changed parties earlier this year and became a major focus of campaign efforts on both sides Other Republicans were ousted in such economically troubled cities as Toledo Ohio Fall River Mass Charleston WVa and Pontiac Mich However Representative John Hiler a freshman Republican in Indiana survived a strong challenge after he was counted out on the basis of early election returns Democrats also ran particularly well in the South where the Republicans had made steady progress by stressing their conservative credentials and such social issues as school prayer and abortion But in Alabama Ben Erdreich a moderate Democrat unseated Representative Albert Lee Smith Jr a hero of the New Right and author of the Family Protection Act In North Carolina where Senator Jesse Helmss political apparatus raised millions of dollars to finance challenges to four incumbent Democrats not one Republican newcomer succeeded In addition two Republican freshmen were ejected by the voters Democrats Gain in Sun Belt The third major focus of attention was the Sun Belt which inherited 17 new seats from the Frost Belt after the 1980 census Republicans had boasted of making major gains in these new seats But at least nine of those seats went to Democrats and most of those winners could be described as politically moderate or even liberal It was a measure of the Democrats tenacity that only three of their incumbents lost One Representative Bob Shamansky of Ohio had captured a Republican district from an incumbent two years ago and was always considered a long shot to return In addition Representatives Leo C Zeferetti of Brooklyn and Peter A Peyser of BronxWestchester were ousted by fellow incumbents in races created by reapportionment However Democrats won the four other headtohead clashes of incumbents in Tuesdays voting Representative Barney Frank crushed Representative Margaret M Heckler in Massachusetts Representative Ike Skelton defeated Wendell Bailey a freshman in Missouri Representative Thomas A Daschle trounced Representative Clint Roberts in a test of Mr Reagans farm policies in South Dakota and Representative Matthew Martinez edged Representative John H Rousselot an outspoken conservative in a California district that had been drawn to favor a Hispanic American With the Martinez victory the Hispanic caucus will grow from six to nine members The newcomers include winners in three new Sun Belt seats Solomon Ortiz of Texas Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Esteban Torres of California A black Democrat Robert Clark was defeated in Mississippi but four other blacks were elected bringing the total to 20 in the new Congress The new freshmen are Alan Wheat the first black to represent Kansas City Mo Katie Hall of Gary Ind and Edolphus Towns and Major Owens of Brooklyn Twentyone women were elected as well which comes to a net gain of one from the past Congress

WHEN A 13-YEAR OLD ASKS FOR AN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/06/opinion/l-when-a-13-year-old-asks-for-an-abortion-014341.html,To the Editor Your Oct 26 editorial about Judge Randall Hekmans refusal to allow an abortion requested by a 13yearold ward of a Michigan court was revealing of your attitude toward unborn human life You say that Judge Hekmans concern for the innocent and defenseless should have prompted him to allow the abortion presumably because a 13yearold who conceives a child after voluntary sexual intercourse is somehow more innocent and defenseless than the child she carries What you did not consider is that Judge Hekman could have been concerned for both the teenage mother and the unborn child but in different ways The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the adoption of the child and the possibility that the young mother will learn right morals and the value of human life especially if there is someone to teach her It is indeed unfortunate and tragic that you continue to push abortion as a solution to teenage pregnancy thus contributing to the moral vacuum that encourages teenage pregnancy LEONARD F VILLA Yonkers Oct 26 1982 The writer is a student at St Josephs Seminary
Anti-Semitism,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/books/l-anti-semitism-011671.html,To the Editor In her review of The Real AntiSemitism in America Oct 3 Ellen Willis has revealed more of her character than she has of our books For instance she attributes to us ideological blinders because we identify Jewish survival with the present economic and social order We wrote of Jewish interest not Jewish survival no small difference that but let it pass inasmuch as we do in fact maintain that America has been good for Jews while the Soviet Union has been bad But attributing to us in the same parapgraph the belief that antiSemitism is the consequence of attempts to change the American order is without any basis in any page of our book In short it is a lie a substitute for reasoned discussion and it is intended to portray us as caricature reactionaries Another lie Our book argues  after stipulating that we favor abortion  that because some religious interests oppose abortion Jews ought not view them as pariahs that rational people can disagree on some issues agree on others that to spurn fundamentalist preachers support for Israels security because of their position on abortion is counterproductive of Jewish interest but that no matter we accept such allies of opportunity on an ad hoc basis we remain free to vigorously differ on other issues Miss Willis distorts this plainly stated position and presents us as maintaining that Jews can live with any form of human misery that does not immediately and directly threaten annihilation If thats a book review Joe McCarthy was a social commentator Our book makes a variety of editorial points and takes a number of positions admittedly controversial But the Willis review does not analyze does not examine does not weigh does no more than name call ie meanspirited morally embarrassing muddleheaded From Literaturnaya Gazeta one would expect this technique NATHAN PERLMUTTER RUTH ANN PERLMUTTER New York City

"CONNECTICUT OPINION;
SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER BURIED IN THE PAST",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/connecticut-opinion-searching-for-an-answer-buried-in-the-past.html,A MISTAKE used to be something I made  not something I was After my aunt told me this surprising and notaltogetherpleasant bit of news my mother confessed that she had indeed thrown caution to the wind and had trusted her future to luck which went ahead and betrayed her One hasty action and nothing is ever the same again For the last 24 years shes had to deal with an always demanding often outspoken sometimes obnoxious remarkably impatient excessively talkative brownhaired daughter who Im sure has caused her as much grief as delight I try to look at myself through my mothers eyes not my own and its almost impossible They tell us that every child is the center of his own universe but how can it be otherwise that growing up entails being able to put yourself in someone elses shoes and also to realize that you are only an infinitesimal and insignificant part of things Granted But ultimately I can only really perceive the world through my own eyes just as my mother can only see things through hers I try to think of myself as my mother did 24 years ago an unwanted intruder thrust upon a woman for whom things were already hard enough For the first year or two of her marriage she had lived at my fathers parents home and felt like a boardinghouse guest When I was born she was living in a cramped apartment on the outskirts of New Haven already saddled with one unplanned but not unloved child my sister My mother tells me of walking home from the store pushing a baby carriage with one hand and holding a bag of groceries in the other of the bag breaking and a dozen oranges rolling all over the street She used to make us freshsqueezed orange juice until one day when my uncle walked in opened the refrigerator and drank her whole mornings work I wonder how she felt then working struggling to make ends meet taking care of an infant and an apartment with no help from my father  men didnt help in those days  and pregnant again Goodness knows I never made it up to her though she loves me just the same I dont know if I deserve it I even denied her the delight of having a child who looks like her though she insists that I do No one else ever thinks so With all the current controversy about motherhood abortion and the right to choose whether or not to have a child I think about what it would have been like had everything been 20 years later Or had it been as easy then not to have a child as it is now Of course I support to the utmost a womans right to choose  and along with that right the right not to have to subordinate her life to the life of an infant before shes ready But theres still a nagging thought in the back of my mind If my mother had chosen not to have a child I was the child she wouldnt have had Theres a wonderful line in Mary McCarthys novel The Group Even when she had wished to die she had not wished never to have been alive Yes even when things are horrible  absolutely horrible  I cant honestly say that I would choose never to have been born though of course one never has the power to choose for ones self But at that moment when she found out she was going to have a child she didnt want my mother had the power to choose for me Its ridiculous to think about it The world has always gone on with circumstances as they were and that was that But it puts things in a whole new light I think how unique each genetic combination is and how chances are one in a zillion that the genes and chemicals and everything else to create each individual will get together and how if you think in those terms every persons existence is mere chance I mean I could just as easily have been a boy or a girl with curly hair instead of straight and then I wouldnt have been myself either The whole thing is a grand accident anyway Still somehow somethings wrong  unlike say if I had barely escaped being hit by a truck Its knowing not that I was unplanned but that after all of the right random infinitesimal connections had been made to create no one else but me  me  after all that I could have come so close to not having existed It brings up the whole heartbreaking question of everything that might have been Everythings coincidence Im convinced the connections we make the people we fall in love with the spur of the moment feelings that compel us to make all those irrevocable mistakes to take those steps sometimes immediately regretted which can never be retraced As EM Forster wrote Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant Yes The consequences of one toohasty decision may last a lifetime But instead of things as they might have been my very life is a negative example of things as they might not have been In accordance with my parents plans I would never have existed Every fence has two sides and I stand on the edge able to see both of them I understand how someone could not want a child But how can I reconcile that with my own life knowing that I owe that life only to Mom and Dads poor judgment Yet they love me just the same  and did from the moment I was born But thats not to say that things werent excruciatingly hard or that they never regretted my demands my embarrassing statements my selfcenteredness But they later came to regret that there was a point when it was no longer in their power to make me happy Im theirs no longer but the difference I have made in their lives in the meantime is enormous My parents even admitted that they considered having another child after me they wanted a boy so I guess things didnt turn out too badly after all Sometimes a mistake can be a blessing in disguise my mother says
TV VIEW; YESTERDAY'S TABOOS ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/arts/tv-view-yesterday-s-taboos-are-taken-for-granted-now.html,Different times different standards and practices at least as far as televisions censors are concerned Arguments continue unabated as to whether television merely reflects society or is a major influence for better or worse on social changes Most likely it does both to varying degrees But television itself certainly does change Consider subjects that were taboo or highly sensitive in the nottoodistant past but today are almost commonplace There is for instance abortion Remember the episode on Maude in which the Beatrice Arthur character over 40 had to decide if she could risk having a baby at her age Maude opted after very serious consideration for an abortion That was a decade ago and the nations antiabortion forces were incensed and Maudes decision became a national issue Jumping to 1982 though we find a TV movie entitled Take Your Best Shot which was broadcast a couple of weeks ago on CBS This sensitive portrait of an outofwork actor had the hero played by Robert Urich separated from his wife and meeting an outspoken young woman in his acting class In a cafeteria the classmate informed him that she had just had an abortion He was not terribly impressed one way or another The two then jumped into bed for what amounted to a onenight stand Hardly a murmur of protest was heard throughout the land There is for another instance homosexuality At around the same time as Maudes abortion there was a TV film called That Certain Summer which tackled with some courage a love relationship between two men one of them married and the father of a son With Hal Holbrook and Martin Sheen as the men the treatment was extremely careful in making the characters exemplary Who could possibly attack two human beings who appeared ready for canonization Yet at the time there was questioning from some quarters as to whether the very subject no matter how tastefully handled should even be addressed on the national airwaves But once again looking at Take Your Best Shot which like That Certain Summer was a LevinsonLink Production we find Mr Urich asking another actor almost in passing about his male lover Learning that the homosexual relationship had broken up after several years the Urich character was properly sympathetic and later went into a restaurant business with the same actor The question of sexual preference had almost imperceptibly been reduced to total insignificance Like violence of course sex has long been a staple of popular entertainment Still what used to be called the new permissiveness has entered the television mainstream with remarkable ease Comedy has proved to be an especially convenient vehicle The weekly cavortings on The Love Boat for example are persistently inventive in getting people in and out of bed Among recent TV movies ABCs The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch featured the respectable ladies and the flashy prostitutes of a small town actually called Sweetwater confronting each other as the menfolk marched off to the Civil War Scenes of the women engaging in fistfights hairpulling and wrestling in mud holes sometimes verged apparently with calculation on softcore pornography And then there was For Lovers Only also recently on ABC which offered an almost beatific Andy Griffith presiding over a special resort for honeymooners Mr Griffith played a widower who professed to believe in the sanctity of marriage and the importance of the honeymoon as its launching pad Before long however the viewer discovered that the resort was little more than a deluxe motel for swinging singles Groups of pretty young people kept appearing periodically to stroke each other suggestively and then run off squealing to the nearest available room for an orgy So much for the widower and traditional values On a somewhat more serious level Having It All presented a few weeks ago as an antic romantic comedy on ABC offered Dyan Cannon as a bigamist whose biggest mistake seemed to be that she got caught Miss Cannon played a successful fashion designer married to a mature sophisticated businessman in New York and also through some unbelievable mixup to a young sexy illustrator in Los Angeles Everything was proceeding quite nicely until each husband decided he wanted to spend more time with his wife At that point the dominant mode switched to farce as Miss Cannon tried frantically to keep the two men apart When they finally did meet of course things turned serious to the point where a chastened Miss Cannon was forced to spend New Years Eve alone Before fadeout though she was being reconciled with the forgiving East Coast husband He may have been older but he was also richer TV punishment can have its rewards A step in another more complicated direction was taken in Not in Front of the Children shown on CBS a week or so ago and determined to be very serious indeed Here we had Linda Gray on leave from Dallas as the divorced mother of two very young girls She was having an affair with handsome John Getz nine years her junior who proposed that they get married But the Gray character was uncertain about committing herself to another marriage Instead she invited Getz to move in not least because the daughters thought he was wonderful Needless to say this did not sit well with the girls natural father played by John Lithgow Urged on by his own father he filed a suit for custody of the children claiming they were living in a situation that could affect their moral standards That much was pretty standard stuff for a TV movie or soap opera But Not in Front of the Children went a bit farther Miss Gray her lover and the children became the noble standard bearers for the forces of enlightened liberation proclaiming that a person can live any way or do anything as long as it doesnt hurt anyone On the other hand her former husband was portrayed as a repressed creep who Miss Gray tearfully revealed had sex with her only once a week Moreover his father was a Protestant minister spewing fire and brimstone on the

DEMOCRATS' JOY NOT UNALLOYED; PLAN WENT AWRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/democrats-joy-not-unalloyed-plan-went-awry.html,PUBLICLY state Democratic leaders say they could not be happier about the outcome of the Congressional races last week Theres no way I could be close to disappointed said James Maloney the Democratic state chairman after the party captured one Republican seat This gave the Democrats a 9to5 advantage over the GOP in the 14member delegation that the state will send to the House of Representatives next year In reality the Democrats wanted and thought they would get  a wider edge But the Congressional game plan that they began plotting last January with the Legislatures reapportioning of the states Congressional Districts went awry on Election Day Two seats that the Democrats were confident of winning were retained by Republican incumbents And a GOP seat that they were uncertain about seizing fell to them They got that pleasant surprise in the new Ninth District in Bergen County where the winner was Robert G Torricelli a 31yearold lawyer new to the voters but an old hand at mapping political campaigns Before setting out on his own Mr Torricelli played an important role in shaping former Gov Brendan T Byrnes 1977 reelection campaign and later the CarterMondale campaign in Illinois in the 1980 Presidential election Mr Torricelli upset Harold C Hollenbeck the 43yearold threeterm Republican incumbent Reapportionment had squeezed Mr Hollenbeck from a safe Republican district into one dominated by enrolled Democrats including Bergen Countys traditionally big blocs in Fair Lawn Teaneck and Englewood Persistently since last January Mr Torricelli attended hundreds of small campaign parties and knocked on thousands of doors In the end he startled even himself with his margin of victory He won by roughly 13000 votes capturing 54 percent of the total to 46 percent for Mr Hollenbeck We thought we were just going to slip across Mr Torricelli said It was a substantial victory That was the most surprising thing Even more surprising to state Democratic leaders were the losses suffered by Joseph P Merlino in the new Fourth District and Adam K Levin in the new Seventh Mr Merlino is former President of the State Senate and Mr Levin ia a former director of the states Division of Consumer Affairs Weeks ago Democratic Party leaders considered them sure shots to beat the respective incumbents Christopher H Smith a 29yearold freshman Representative who ousted Frank Thompson Jr after Mr Thompsons Abscam conviction in 1980 and Matthew J Rinaldo a popular sixterm Congressman who always had won at least 60 percent of the vote in each of his previous campaigns The redistricting supposedly gave Mr Merlino a secure Democratic district in and around Trenton his political power base in his 15year legislative career Mr Smith on the other hand had his hometown of Old Bridge shifted into another district by the Democraticcontrolled Legislature and he was forced to move to Trenton to run in the new Fourth District In the end Mr Smith prevailed capturing 53 percent of the vote and a plurality of about 9000 Mr Levins margin of defeat was even greater in his race with Mr Rinaldo Despite investing about 1 million in an intensive advertising blitz Mr Levin  he is heir to a shopping center magnate  captured only 44 percent of the vote losing to Mr Rinaldo by roughly 20000 votes How did Mr Merlino and Mr Smith run afoul of the voters Pundits and party leaders had some dayafter explanations These races werent so much won by the incumbents as lost by the challengers said Neil A Upmeyer director of the states Division of Elections in the Byrne Administration and now a Princetonbased political analyst and consultant The personalities of the candidates were the critical and deciding factors in the two races Mr Upmeyer declared not Reaganomics or some other broader or weightier issue It just became a question of personality said Jerry Wade executive director of the state Democratic Party The focus of those races turned more to individual attributes and that turned to the disadvantage of Mr Merlino and Adam Levin In his concession speech Mr Merlino said that his style was not in vogue Over the years he has developed a reputation as a cigarchomping oldline political leader with a big and generous heart and a quick and gruff temper At times he becomes abrasive In one joint appearance with Mr Smith during the campaign Mr Merlino so the story goes was talking to reporters when Mr Smith sought to interject a comment Quiet kid Mr Merlino said to his 29yearold opponent Im talking to the press When I get to Washington look me up I may give you a job as a page That comment was fairly widely circulated and is thought to have harmed Mr Merlinos image Party analysts point to other problems for him For example they say  He had trouble raising money  The press was unfavorable  Strong support that Mr Merlino once enjoyed from Italian and other ethnic voters in bluecollar wards in and around Trenton ebbed On the other hand Mr Smith was beieved to have benefited from his staunch opposition to abortion and gun control It was a heartbreaking loss for the party Mr Wade said Representative James J Florio of Runnemede the titular head of the Democratic Party in the state suggested that both Mr Merlino and Mr Levin would have improved their chances with stronger protrayals of Mr Smith and Mr Rinaldo as loyalists to Reaganomics instead of allowing the contests to become very bitter individualversusindividual races You take on an incumbent that way at your own peril Mr Florio said Mr Wade the state partys executive director said that the two GOP incumbents had been very diligent in catering to their constituencies and benefited from that attentiveness on Election Day Mr Smith he said had worked his tail off since winning his Congressional seat in 1980 I dont think there was an Eagle Scout Court of Honor he missed in two years Mr Wade said As for Mr Levins loss Mr Wade said If I had to point to one thing its that Rinaldo is a real homedistrict Congressman He takes care of his constituents Hes a hometown Congressman and thats where he won it  in the home towns While the winning margins of Mr Rinaldo Mr Smith and Mr Torricelli were comfortable at least 6 percentage points they were the narrowest of the 14 Congressional contests Incumbent Democrats and Republicans won in the 11 other districts by routs Triumphant Democrats and their percentages of the vote were Mr Florio First District 74 percent William J Hughes Second 69 James J Howard Third 63 Bernard J Dwyer Sixth 68 Robert A Roe Eighth 71 Peter W Rodino 10th 84 Joseph G Minish 11th 60 and Frank J Guarini 14th 77 Winning Republicans and their percentages were Marge S Roukema Fifth District 66 percent Edwin B Forsythe 13th 61 and James A Courter 12th 70 Mr Wade and Mr Florio both argued that Mr Torricellis triumph was keyed to voter repudiation of Reaganomics But Mr Torricelli said that it was more than Reaganomics and that he had turned to issues that other candidates ignored Among them were gun control and opposition to more nuclearpower plants Unemployment the environment personal and public safety  these were issues that the voters of Bergen County felt strongly about Mr Torricelli said in his victory statement Party analysts and others saw other critical elements Mr Torricelli campaigned strenously during the spring summer and early fall while Mr Hollenbeck remained in Washington Some believed that the incumbent had not cultivated constituents enough and had underestimated Mr Torricellis challenge Mr Hollenbeck avoided some facetoface debates with his challenger sending a surrogate in his place Although Mr Hollenbeck was considered a solid Republican moderate Mr Torricelli frequently had him on the defensive about his early backing of President Reagans economic program and on environmental issues Mr Hollenbeck pointed to his Democraticdominated new district as a factor in his downfall Tough odds he said
FEMINIST CAUSE LOOKS BACK TO GRASS ROOTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/08/style/feminist-cause-looks-back-to-grass-roots.html,Koryne Horbal is one of a new breed of political feminists  women who have gone the traditional route in politics found it wanting and as a result have turned their focus back to the grass roots where their political activity began Mrs Horbal a former member of the Democratic National Committee and the founder of its Womens Caucus has her roots in Minnesota where she and her colleagues began organizing 4000 state precincts a little more than a year ago Their ultimate objective was to elect legislators either incumbents or challengers with a feminist stance particularly those who favored choice on abortion The results of the first phase which ended with the election last week were mixed but according to Mrs Horbal encouraging We had enough of an impact so that a number of legislators and candidates who had stayed on the sidelines on the equal rights amendment came out and publicly supported it she said We also made many of them acutely aware of the political power of women One of them even took out an ad after the election and thanked women for their support Legislature Still Negative The prochoice endeavor a key issue in the eyes of Mrs Horbal who was raised in a Roman Catholic household met with less success Some gains were made in the number of candidates elected but on the whole the Legislature remained heavily weighted with opponents of abortion Right from the start we had a longterm commitment to this Mrs Horbal said We knew it wasnt something we could do in one election The qualified success in this area has already led to a change in emphasis and the rethinking of the plans for the 1984 campaign Precinct caucuses are scheduled to remain an integral part of strategy with the first priority finding suitable candidates to put before the caucuses We were trying to take over 4000 precincts and change the attitude Mrs Horbal continued This next time we are going to focus not so much on the issue of prochoice as on the candidate who will be prochoice When we go to the precinct caucuses we will have our candidate ready In many cases people arent comfortable with one issue but they will vote for someone who believes in that along with a lot of other issues Its easier to motivate people around a person rather than an issue The return to campaigning at the grassroots level began 18 months ago when a group of Minnesota feminists including Mrs Horbal who commutes between Minneapolis and New York realized that lobbying the State Legislature was ineffective The numbers were no longer there for us she said There were 67 Senate members and we had only about 17 votes In the House with 134 members there were no more than 20 or 30 with a feminist prochoice stand It was at this point that individuals from various organizations that supported choice banded together to form Project 13 an educational program and Campaign 13 a political program The numeral 13 was chosen because it takes 13 states to stop a constitutional amendment such as that being proposed on abortion Mrs Horbal a political activist since high school credits her father Stanley Kaneski the son of Polish immigrants with her concern with government He was always very interested in Eleanor Roosevelt and we were all girls in the family she said He would talk to us at the dinner table about not letting our gender hamper us in anything we wanted to do When I married hed babysit when I went to poliical meetings Hes now 82 and although hes Catholic he understands what Im trying to do and hes very supportive Her first personal brush with the political system was at the precinct level when she became involved in trying to keep open a childrens park After that she related It was the usual route of most women in politics as fulltime chairwoman of this and that at precinct city and state levels She went on When I became chairwoman of the state party of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party I wasnt paid but the chairman was That started me thinking that women in the party were really powerless From Darling to Radical After she instituted a study of women and the party to give women a view of where we were overnight they began calling me a raving feminist a radical she said adding Before that I had been the darling of the party I even made drapes for the headquarters The result was that a percentage of delegates from then on were women and that the labels chairman and chairwoman were abolished in favor of chairperson and associate chairperson both paid Mrs Horbal went on to the Democratic National Committee and in the early 1970s started the Womens Caucus of the committee The caucus wasnt organized so much for womens issues as it was as a power base for women on the committee she said And one of the first things we did was open Executive Committee meetings to the press and observers For the past six years Mrs Horbal has been commuting between New York and Minneapolis where her husband of 25 years William Horbal a sewer and water contractor lives Their son Steven is in college in Minnesota and their daughter Lynn is finishing high school The commuting became necesssary during the Carter Administration when Mrs Horbal was appointed a member of the United States Mission to the United Nations to deal with womens issues it has continued because she is now executive director of the Wonder Woman Foundation a nonprofit New York organization that makes grants to outstanding women over age 40 The people who banded together to work on Project and Campaign 13 came from diverse groups Planned Parenthood the League of Women Voters the National Organization for Women the American Association of University Women and the feminist caucuses of the two major political parties Their decision to return to a grassroots strategy was based on the states political framework All 4000 precincts in Minnesota caucus every two years like a town meeting Mrs Horbal said The system is that if you dont have an impact at the precinct level you dont have any impact electing delegates because these delegates elect delegates at the next level and they go on at further levels to endorse candidates The same system operates in 12 other states she said and there are similar ones in an additional 15 We started out with a steering committee of about 20 of the most political feminists from every organization in which prochoice was one of the issues she said The feminists were both men and women And we had another 40 organizations who were willing to cooperate The group decided to concentrate on State Senate races and before the election covered 64 of the 67 senatorial districts One or two organizers were trained from each district and these organizers in turn attended precinct caucuses Support and Some Problems By the time the convention rolled around Project 13 had become known as Democrats for Liberal Issues gaining support but faced with two major problems One was reapportionment Mrs Horbal said and the other was difficulty in finding candidates particularly in the short time left However she added the concentration at the precinct level resulted in the retention of all the prochoice incumbents and a gain of four seats in the State Senate far fewer than the hopedfor 15 but encouraging Many feminists like myself who were partyoriented and involved in national boards and organizations found that because we ignored what was happening in state legislatures we did not do well and that was one of the reasons we lost the ERA Mrs Horbal said We had majority positions in the polls on many of our issues but this did not translate in electoral politics We feel that if we continue concentrating at the grassroots level this will not happen again
LESSON OF 1982: PERSONAL ATTACK AS A NECESSITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/09/us/lesson-of-1982-personal-attack-as-a-necessity.html,Any number of columnists and candidates have decried the negative tone of the 1982 Congressional campaigns as if the meanness that spewed from television sets and directmail envelopes was the result of some transient distemper brought on by the recession In fact such attacks seem likely to be a prominent part of the political scene for the foreseeable future That is because candidates and campaign strategists like generals cannot resist using a weapon once it is been perfected and certainly the 1982 campaign year witnessed the perfecting of hightech mudslinging That is one of several lessons that seem worth a final moments reflection before the campaign notes are relegated to the file cabinet and the hot blasts of campaign oratory give way to the statesmanlike droning of yet another Congress Mudslinging is a primitive art rooted in the folklore of our politics For years its practice was limited by the fact that to attack ones rival was to give him recognition So the accepted wisdom was that one did not use television or newspaper advertising to publicize a rivals name and likeness except in extraordinary circumstances The idea was to make the opponent dip into his own campaign treasury to purchase his own name ID But advances in advertising and campaign fundraising have made the direct personal attack not only possible but necessary As one Washington television consultant explained when asked about the new vogue for attack advertising Everybody in competitive races these days has enough money to buy all the name ID he needs You just want to make sure its negative name ID So in a year when 300 million was available for campaign spending it was outdated to use television primarily as a tool for enhancing a candidates reputation More and more television dollars were spent to undermine an opponents image Yet despite the great reach of television direct mail is often the weapon of choice for those who go in for serious combat That is because a letter denouncing a candidates stand on say abortion or gun control can be sent to a targeted constituency so privately and so late in the campaign that it cannot be answered before the election For years professional strategists candidates and journalists have known that the shoeleather campaign was an anachronism Yet like highchurch traditionalists battling for the old liturgy they have clung to the comfortable forms of the past Candidates still tramp through shopping centers and gnaw on catfish or kielbasa depending on the ethnic composition of their districts Reporters still follow the candidates reporting their words and deeds Even so it is increasingly clear that the candidate and his entourage are appendages to the real contest which is a matchup of polling broadcast advertising and mailing lists Back in the headquarters they determine where the candidate is going what the theme is said one Republican professional The headquarters makes the decision of where the media buys are They make the decisions about direct mail This year the most extreme refinement of the candidateasappendage approach was practiced by the Congressional Club the political action committee of Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina The club recruited Congressional candidates flew them around the country for audiences with wealthy contributors dictated positions on key issues produced their advertising and directed their mailings In the end the majority of the Congressional Club candidates were defeated but that should not be taken as evidence that their techniques will be abandoned Rather 1984 will bring the spectacle of Presidential candidates and their attendant reporters bashing around the country in airplanes while the real campaigns are conducted in Washington In this new order the campaign plane is reduced to one distinction Thats probably the only place where a mistake can cost you the campaign said the Republican professional In the new campaign weaponry polls have become enormously important for novel reasons For example to gain entrance to political action committees which are the fat cats of todays political order a candidate needs a survey or at least an encouraging letter from a bigname polltaker Sometimes the polltakers themselves become a tactical weapon For example on a number of occasions this year prominent pollsters were invited to predict longshot winners Almost invariably they picked candidates of their own party and quite often they predicted victory for their own clients Shortly before Election Day Lance Torrance a well known polltaker for Republicans held a news conference in Alabama at which he announced that his client Emory Folmar was in a dead heat with George C Wallace in the gubernatorial race Mr Torrance said he entered the fray to rebut what he regarded as a statistically flawed survey by The Birmingham PostHerald which showed Mr Wallace ahead by 20 points It wasnt but about two days after I left that Wallace started picking up steam Mr Torrance recalled Then he came out and won by 18 or 19 points so it looks like they were right all along The episode of course raised suspicions that Mr Torrance had released figures intended to make his candidate appear stronger than he really was But he insisted that his figures were correct when he released them They turned out to be wrong he said because his poll sample underestimated the heavy black turnout for Mr Wallace It was he added only the second time in his career that he had publicly released figures on an election in which he was involved In each case he said he felt his candidate was being victimized by others polls If we made mistakes he said they were honest mistakes in that we could not figure out what the turnout would be As an afterthought he observed If the Republican party doesnt solve the black turnout problem advances in the South will not only be limited They may be halted
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/us/briefing-020420.html,SpecialInterest Tally C laiming victory in Congressional elections used to be the exclusive province of Republicans and Democrats and the figures were pretty clear cut Today with a multitude of specialinterest and singleissue committees also participating you dont really know what happened on the underlying issues until you read past the party assertions to the special analysis On the sensitive question of abortion for example the National Abortion Rights Action League has come up with some figures on last weeks voting that it regards as significant Of the 19 Senators seeking reelection who voted to defeat Senator Jesse Helmss antiabortion amendment this fall and thus became political targets only one Harrison Schmitt the New Mexico Republican was a loser The leagues political action committee made contributions in 13 Senate contests and its candidates won in nine all except California Delaware Missouri and Virginia for a 66 percent average In the House candidates supported by the group won 74 of 104 races or 71 percent I think these numbers tell us that the abortion issue doesnt hurt prochoice candidates any more said Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the league We gained some real strength in the House but just as important we changed the old perception that our candidates get defeated in the tough headon races On the opposite side of the issue the National Right to Life Political Action Committee made direct contributions to 75 Senate and House candidates of whom 36 or 48 percent won Dan Donahay a committee spokesman said that the group had invested more of its money in closer contests than had the abortion rights league and thus tended to have a somewhat lower victory ratio Voices From the Past T he pervasive crackle on some of the recordings only increases the sense of deja entendu The great airlanes performances of some 50 years ago are nearly all there Father Coughlin Lux Radio Theater Jessica Dragonette HV Kaltenborn Easy Aces you name it The Library of Congress has just published a handy 149page index of its collection of 5100 transcriptions of live broadcasts made between 1924 and 1941 when you had to go to an aircooled movie to get pictures with your sound This special archive ranges from news NBCs 229 PM bulletin of Dec 7 1941 through humor Eddie Cantor and Joe Penner to culture Orson Welles and Information Please The selection is largely hitormiss a random sample of programming that early stations saw fit for some reason to transcribe Rudy Vallee for example has more recordings available than either Adolph Hitler or Franklin D Roosevelt There is only one obstacle to enjoying this feast of history and entertainment The library will be glad to play any selection in the radio catalogue but you cant record it yourself without written permission from the owner of broadcast rights the station or network involved The Original Amateur Hour and Lum and Abner have considerable value on the nostalgia market today even if you cant see them Curfew on Inquiries A newspaper deskman called the White House press office a little after 11 the other evening to check a published report of an impending Cabinet appointment He was told that the night duty officer Mort Allin was not there and had left word that he was not to be disturbed until the following morning Reached by telephone at home Mr Allin explained that he had established an 11 PM curfew for White House information when he was on duty because he had been working long hours and getting too many questions unrelated to the nations business Collectors Paradise A s an autograph collector Barry E Piatt has two major advantages he works in Washington and his boss Representative Tom Harkin of Iowa is willing to do his legwork upon occasion As a result the 29yearold press secretary owns among other things a copy of the Camp David agreements signed by Anwar elSadat Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter for which he has been offered 5000 and a copy of the pardon of Richard M Nixon signed by Gerald R Ford The prize pieces were obtained by Mr Harkin by standing in line at receptions restricted to dignitaries On a large engraving of the White House Mr Piatt himself has collected the autographs of all members of the current Cabinet but he has yet to breach the Secret Service lines around President Reagan or Vice President Bush Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr
"MR. FALWELL MEETS AN OUTSPOKEN ANTAGONIST, YALE'S GIAMATTI",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/nyregion/mr-falwell-meets-an-outspoken-antagonist-yale-s-giamatti.html,The Rev Jerry Falwell the founder of Moral Majority met here today with one of the organizations most outspoken critics A Bartlett Giamatti president of Yale University in a session arranged by Vice President Bush I told him I feel you were wrong then and I feel you are wrong now but I feel we can disagree and remain friends  Mr Falwell said after emerging from a 45minute discussion with Mr Giamatti In a speech last year Mr Giamatti assailed Moral Majority as propagating dangerous malicious nonsense Mr Giamatti and the Yale administration did not publicly announce the meeting Until 4 PM when Mr Falwell mounted the marble stairs to Mr Giamattis highceilinged office the official position was that Yale knew nothing of a meeting Mr Giamatti did not come out of his office after the meeting to comment Mr Falwell however said the men had discussed a variety of issues He said they had agreed on most Some people might accuse Mr Giamatti of being a conservative  and disagreed on others specifically prayer in public schools Mr Falwell favors it and Mr Giamatti has frequently opposed it The Yale president and Mr Falwell who calls himself a Baptist preacher from the hills of Appalachia also traded personally inscribed copies of their latest books The Fundamentalist Phenomenon by Mr Falwell and The University and the Public Interest by Mr Giamatti We talked about Yale and talked about Liberty Baptist College Mr Falwell said referring to the school he founded in Lynchburg Va Were trying to effect a merger Repeating the same joke before an audience of students several hours later Mr Falwell added I will be president of both institutions of course In September 1981 in a speech written for the incoming freshman class Mr Giamatti attacked Moral Majority The speech which was released to the press while Mr Giamatti was hospitalized said Moral Majority licensed a new meanness of spirit in our land a resurgent bigotry that manifests itself in racist and discriminatory postures Mr Giamatti whose declaration landed on the front pages of newspapers nationwide also called Moral Majority and other conservative groups peddlers of coercion in a radical assault on pluralism and civil rights in the United States Moral Majority is a Christian fundamentalist political movement founded in 1979 by Mr Falwell a television evangelist The organization has taken conservative positions on a number of issues and has lobbied particularly actively against legalized abortion Shortly after his declaration Mr Giamatti declined an invitation from the Yale Political Union a student group to debate Mr Falwell He said he saw no point in pursuing the issue any further That led Cal Thomas vice president of communications for Moral Majority to admonish Mr Giamatti to stop hiding behind the intellectual equivalent of his mothers skirt and come out and fight like a man as he told The New Journal a student magazine at Yale During the past summer despite Mr Giamattis refusal to debate Mr Falwell accepted the Yale Political Unions invitation to speak tonight The meeting with Mr Giamatti  who addressed a reunion class at the same hour Mr Falwell spoke  was arranged by Vice President Bush a Yale alumnus and a friend of both men according to Mr Thomas Mr Falwell speaking of the meeting with Mr Giamatti said Theres no war going on so I didnt come to make peace But later he added I dont spend time answering my critics Im playing offense all the time I try to set the agenda try to start most of the wars myself Hero to Campus Conservatives Still charm not conquest characterized Mr Falwells day He disarmed some with wit found foes willing to hear him out and was welcomed as an ideological hero by some The conservative owners of the Yale Literary Magazine for instance whisked Mr Falwell to a reception moments after his private plane set down at 3 PM And in the audience for the speech to the Yale Political Union sat such supporters of Moral Majority as Kathy Quinter a freshman from Pottstown Pa Most of his issues I agree with said Miss Quinter who is 18 years old There are probably a lot of people who feel that way They just feel suppressed from coming out Thirty members of feminist and liberal groups came out to hold a peaceful protest  they called it a Secular Humanist Vigil  outside Strathcona Hall where Mr Falwell spoke The Value of Discord And as the Yale Political Union discovered such discord sold Only members of the union could attend Mr Falwells speech and nearly 100 people paid the 13 annual dues tonight  instantly increasing the size of the group by almost 20 percent Mr Falwell too understood that volatility was part of the appeal He began his speech by noting I will have 20 minutes to speak and you will have 20 minutes to shout Actually the audience of 400 applauded Mr Falwell as he entered the auditorium hissed only a bit at the mention of Moral Majority and bellowed at the introduction of Mr Falwell as a man recognized by People magazine as one of the 25 most intriguing people of 1980 Criticizes the Press The title of Mr Falwells speech was What Are Those Fundamentalists Up To and the answer he implied was Being maligned As he had in each of his forums today he depicted himself as a badly misunderstood man He complained that any religious person who engaged in extreme social of political behavior  such as the Ayatollah Khomeini  was branded as a fundamentalist by the press And he contended that he had been wrongly cast as a bigot If I only preached the gospel of Jesus Christ Mr Falwell had said a few moments earlier at a news conference there would be no problem But because I say there is a standard of right and wrong that upsets the abortionists that upsets the pornographer But he added he does not mind I think a preachers responsibility is to preach the word not to be successful he said It is impossible to make anyone do right

HOW STATE'S NEW CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION LOOKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/nyregion/how-state-s-new-congressional-delegation-looks.html,REAPPORTIONMENT and the midterm elections have displaced or replaced much of the New Jersey Congressional delegation that will be sent to the 98th session of Congress in January For the first time in 20 years New Jersey will be represented in Washington by only 14 Congressmen The decrease from 15 Congressional seats  it reflects the failure of the state to grow as rapidly as the rest of the nation as shown in the 1980 Census marks the first time since 1843 that the state delegation has shrunk The group 13 incumbents and one newcomer will represent New Jerseys 7364158 residents for the next two years Each will receive an annual salary of 60832 and have available should he or she decide to take advantage of them generous tax breaks The delegation is mostly homegrown and reared Eleven were born in New Jersey many within the district they now represent and eight of the 10 with college degrees matriculated at New Jersey state colleges or at some branch of Rutgers the State University Those without degrees are Bernard J Dwyer Democrat of Edison Robert A Roe Democrat of Wayne Joseph G Minish Democrat of West Orange and Edwin B Forsythe Republican of Moorestown Looking at the average personal profile of the delegation it is possible to draw a picture of the kind of person most likely to represent New Jersey in Congress Of the 14 13 are men nine are Democrats six are lawyers and five served in the State Legislature before going to Washington The average age of a New Jersey Representative to the 98th Congress is 526 years The average tenure is six terms Peter W Rodino Democrat of Newark is the dean of the delegation both in age  he is 73  and time in office he was just elected to his 18th term The newest member of the delegation Robert G Torricelli is two years older than Christopher H Smith Republican of Trenton who is 29 Mr Torricelli who lives in the Bergen County community of New Milford was the only challenger to unseat an incumbent on Nov 2 He defeated Harold C Hollenbeck a threeterm Republican by 13000 votes THE only newcomer in the state delegation Robert G Torricelli was born in Paterson grew up in Franklin Lakes and attended Rutgers in New Brunswick receiving a BA in sociology He later attended Rutgers Law School and the Harvard School of Government where he received a masters degree in public administration Mr Torricellis race against Representative Harold C Hollenbeck which resulted in the only defeat of an incumbent was his first for elective office but not his first involvement with government or politics When he was 18 years old he served as a county Democratic Committeeman from Franklin Lakes and during the 1974 oil crisis  while still at Rutgers  he worked in former Gov Brendan T Byrnes Energy Office In 1976 Mr Torricelli joined Mr Byrnes staff as an assistant later moving up to Deputy Legislative Counsel after he had graduated from law school In 1978 he went to Washington where he became a counsel to former Vice President Walter F Mondale later joining Mr Mondale in private law practice I left Mondale a little less than a year ago Mr Torricelli said I went back to Bergen County and started running for Congress Mr Torricelli ran an energetic wellorganized and effective campaign that took him to 22000 private homes in his district He said he was most proud of his having been able to raise about 270000 so far from more than 2000 individual contributors We outspent my opponent Mr Torricellis campaign cost 330000 and we did it having said we wouldnt take more than 33 percent of our budget from political action committees Mr Torricelli said We wouldnt take money from any oil interest and we wouldnt take it from Defense Department contractors I think thats an important thing for young Democrats to realize You can beat big money and you can beat the corporate PAC if youre willing to take the time and make the effort Mr Torricelli wasted no time in going to Washington Two days after the election he was working out of the Washington office of Representative Frank J Guarini Democrat of Jersey City thanking contributors seeking advice and lining up support in his quest for choice committee assignments Mr Torricelli wants his principal committee work to be in the area of economic growth what he calls the principal issue facing both his district the Ninth and the country He noted that seats on the House Commerce Committee had become available as a result of the election but he has not yet made up his mind Mr Torricelli also would consider a spot on the Foreign Relations Committee where New Jersey is now represented by Millicent Fenwick Republican of Bernardsville Mrs Fenwick of course will not be returning next year having lost to Frank R Lautenberg in the race for United States Senator Mr Torricelli is looking forward to getting to work I suspect that the thing I will be most noted for is being heard he said Its time for new people and new voices to be heard in this Government and I am both Mr Torricellis primary concerns for his first Congressional term will be economic growth environmental protection and handgun control the issue he said probably contributed most to his victory The handguncontrol people plan to have me travel around the country and speak as the one and only person who ran on the issue and won he said Mr Torricelli is married to the former Susan Holloway who was office administrator for Mr Mondale when he was a Senator from Minnesota and then Vice President The Torricellis have no children and plan to live in both Washington and New Milford First District  James J Florio Democrat of Runnemede  Chairman

PERSPECTIVES; PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS: IT'S TIME FOR A TRUCE; BY CHESTER E. FINN JR.,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/education/perspectives-public-private-schools-it-s-time-for-truce-chester-e-finn-jr.html,AMONG the unfinished business awaiting Congress when it returns to W ashington is the disposition of President Reagans tuition t axcredit proposal as modified and approved by the Senate Finance C ommittee in September This bill would provide the tuitionpaying p arents of private elementary or secondary school students with a p artial credit against their Federal income tax In its current form i t would be limited to 300 per student would not be available to v ery wealthy families and could be claimed only when the school i tself satisfied various requirements including nondiscrimination ont he basis of race or disability The estimated annual cost to the T reasury would be 750 million when fully implemented Practically nobody expects the lameduck 97th Congress to enact this legislation which means its proponents are likely to try once again when the 98th congress convenes in January It probably wont pass then either In fact the idea of tuition tax credits bids fair to remain a subject of hot controversy for a very long time to come Like welfare reform peace in the Middle East arms reduction and budgetbalancing it may be entering that class of Federal policy issues that are moreorless permanently on the nations agenda and never seem to get resolved This is a great misfortune for American education but not because tuition tax credits are an especially wonderful or horrible idea in their own right In fact as most analysts of private education would now concede the idea is largely obsolescent Tax credits were reasonably wellsuited to the era when they began to attract serious interest the period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when privateschool enrollments were plummeting Roman Catholic parochial schools were closing and the future of private education itself seemed in grave jeopardy Insofar as transferring additional financial resources into private schools might strengthen them stabilize their enrollments and thereby insure some continuation of educational pluralism in the United States the taxcredit mechanism was imaginatively conceived moderately efficient and likely to be fairly effective It was also the most promising detour around the many obstacles that a series of increasingly confused Supreme Court decisions had placed in the way of more direct forms of public aid to nongovernmental education at the elementarysecondary level Now however private education as a whole is enjoying reasonably sound institutional health Many schools have all the students they can handle and a number have waiting lists New ones are opening Even Catholic schools after a precipitous 44 percent decline from 1964 to 1979 have recently seen their national enrollments stabilize Although a recent Census Bureau report shows that only 10 youngsters in 100 attend private schools today compared with 14 per 100 in the mid60s and although some sectors  especially Catholic schools in the inner cities and older suburbs of declining snow belt states  remain fragile and vulnerable private education is generally stable and optimistic And certain of its segments particularly the schools run by fundamentalist Protestant churches are growing by leaps and bounds The case for tuition tax credits therefore can no longer be persuasively based on the assumption that without such aid nongovernmental education will shrivel and die Today it is usually grounded in other policy objectives such as revitalizing the nations entire educational system through increased competition or giving lowincome families economic access to the same highquality private schooling that welltodo families can purchase for themselves Those are worthy goals and legitimate policy directions But tuition tax credits at least in the versions that the Reagan Administration and the Congress take seriously are illsuited for these purposes The great good that tax credit proponents proclaim would more likely turn out to be a marginal improvement and would almost surely be accompanied by an array of government regulations and constraints that would erode the distinctiveness and worth of nongovernmental education Neither however would tuition tax credits lead to the great evils that their opponents forecast They would not be the death knell of public education No large enrollment shift from public to private schools would occur A few lowermiddleincome families now teetering on the brink of a shift would be better able to afford it Some of the heavy burden now borne by workingclass parents would be eased But no huge reallocation of Federal resources from public to private schooling would take place Congress is virtually incapable of making such tradeoffs even if it wanted to the lost revenues attributable to tuition tax credits would vanish into the general debate on tax cuts and increases and the heated controversy about future Federal support for education at all levels will continue If tuition tax credits would not do much good or much harm why is so much attention lavished on the issue The answer to that question turns out to be far more consequential than the specific pros and cons of tuition tax credits and suggests that perhaps the nation would be better served if we were to set the idea aside and move on to consideration of other means of fostering educational excellence in all schools private as well as public The Federal Government has a proper if limited role to play in that extraordinarily important undertaking but is not apt to play it satisfactorily as long as attention centers on the divisive issue of tuition tax credits Tuition tax credits has become a social issue like abortion busing and prayer in public schools Where once its staunchest advocates were liberal Democrats and moderate Republicans today its most visible supporters are the most conservative of Reaganites This state of affairs is ridiculous But it is also why tuition tax credits will neither be enacted nor permanently rejected And it is why a coolingoff period might permit sensible people who have high hopes for both public and private schooling to come together in common pursuit of better education This requires neither that we ignore authentic differences between the two forms of schooling nor that we hide from all controversy But consider some of the good tough educational improvements that could enlist the support of good toughminded educators and laymen from all sectors Item If educational diversity and parental choice are valuable there is no reason to confine them to private schooling One of the great challenges to public education in the 80s is to break schools out of the mold of uniformity to create special emphases and missions in particular schools or in parts of the same schools and to help parents and students choose those that best suit their needs Item Much sound research shows that the best schools have clear institutional identities wellformulated goals and enough autonomy at the building level for able principals to exercise effective leadership This is as true of public as of private schools and creates obvious opportunities for cooperative ventures to define goals to train and retrain principals as educational leaders and to create conditions in which public schools obtain some of the freedom now widely found in private schools Item Good teachers are already in short supply as are specialists in such fields as math and science and when the enrollment upturn hits the elementary schools a few years hence even ordinary ones may be hard to hire Surely public and private educators have a common interest in the upgrading of teacher quality  and the private sector may have a few things to teach the public beginning with the irrelevance of most state licensure and certification requirements Item Publicschool parents incur direct educational costs too and the parlous financial condition of many states and localities will likely lead to even more lab and activity fees book charges and unsubsidized field trips Louisiana and Minnesota already permit modest state tax breaks to parents who incur educational expenses whether in public or private schools A small Federal educational tax credit for which the parents of all schoolchildren were eligible could have enormous appeal Think of it as an extension of the current childcare credit or as an addition to the dependents deduction for those dependents enrolled in grades 1 through 12 Item Wealthy families can indeed afford to send their children to private school or to buy homes in the suburbs with outstanding public schools But what about the educationally disadvantaged minority youngsters the poor and those for whom the public schools are not succeeding Surely a society that seeks to equalize educational opportunity and foster excellence should be able to invent mechanisms  local state or national  whereby those who might benefit most from a private education can have access to it Barbara Lerner has suggested literacy vouchers Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York once proposed needbased scholarships to help impoverished youngsters attend private schools much as Washington already assists them to attend private colleges As long as education remains a battleground between two warring camps its quality will suffer Surely the society would be better served if a truce were made if arms reduction talks got under way if cooperative ventures were examined at every level of policy making and if each sector of education were free to devote more of its energies to domestic needs We cannot decree an end to envy anxiety and institutional selfinterest But it is time to deescalate the rhetoric to set aside the most divisive and politicized disputes and to begin exploring paths to improved education that pay closer attention to how much and how well a child learns than to the auspices under which his school is operated Wouldnt it be splendid if the President made that his premier educational message of the next two years  Chester E Finn Jr is professor of

CATHOLIC BISHOPS ARE TO OPEN NUCLEAR ARMS DEBATE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/15/us/catholic-bishops-are-to-open-nuclear-arms-debate-today.html,The Roman Catholic bishops of the United States have achieved a consensus on the need to speak out against many aspects of the arms race but will debate some unresolved questions principally nuclear deterrence starting today at their annual meeting in Washington Their overall antinuclear stand which is reflected in a proposed pastoral letter to be taken up in the debate already places the bishops at odds both with some Government officials and some of their fellow Catholics The scheduled debate has also shaped up as a dramatic test of the degree to which the churchs attitudes toward military strategy have undergone significant change in the last 15 years Most bishops putting aside differences in theology and policy appear to agree on the essence of the letter since many of their comments were considered as it was being drafted However most are not stating their positions publicly now preferring to wait for the discussions and to avoid aligning themselves with either side as they go into the debate The question of deterrence is most likely to provoke spirited debate As defined by the draft of the pastoral letter deterrence is morally acceptable only if used as a means to negotiate disarmament Some bishops believe that even partial allowance for nuclear weapons contradicts the statements basic condemnation of nuclear war Other bishops would prefer a clearer justification for a nuclear arsenal Among other things the draft condemns nuclear war rejects a strategy of first use of nuclear weapons and calls for a twoway freeze in nuclear arsenals On these and other points the committees proposal differs from policies advocated by the Reagan Administration and it has drawn fire from some Catholics who fear that it would endorse a position that would illegitimately weaken the nations ability to defend itself But in advance of their meeting many influential bishops said they thought the statement had strong support and that few if any major changes would be made in the text My sense is that there is broad support for the pastoral said Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin who headed the committee that drafted the letter and made it public Oct 26 Im sure there are some bishops who would have taken a more pacifist stance And there are a few who feel it goes too far But I would be very surprised if there is a great deal of unhappiness However the bishops range from total pacifists to those who would draw the line at all nuclear weapons and in a more traditional vein those who hold with the conventional theory that allows for justified war under certain strict conditions The section on deterrence echoes the stance of previous church documents The committee used the term morally acceptable found in the message of Pope John Paul II to the United Nations last summer in an effort to find common ground But some bishops including Leroy Matthiesen of Amarillo Tex a leading peace activist argue that nuclear deterrence cannot be justified because it is an evil means used to accomplish a moral end Those who hold this view are expected to push for an amendment to the letter that would go one step further and condemn even the possession of such weapons The Catholic left is upset because the bishops have not gone further said Thomas Fox editor of The National Catholic Reporter an independent journal To this point they have condemned stockpiling use and threatened use of such weapons All that remains is to condemn possession On the other hand Catholic conservatives oppose the statements strong note of restraint as going beyond the Popes intentions Paradox of Deter rence It doesnt deal adequately with the paradox of deterrence said James Finn a Catholic writer who analyzes such issues for Freedom House an organization that monitors human rights The deterrent quality of our nuclear weapons depends on having them and deploying them and having the will to use them Mr Finn added The statement of the bishops seems to sever that political will We would have the weapons but wed take almost a declared position of not using them Its the threat that deters others from using them Another point of discussion over the draft statement is whether it is sufficiently practical and political The recommendations are too fluffy said David OBrien a professor of church history at Holy Cross College What we should say to Catholics is that the only way to become directed to moral ends is to get involved in politics Were opening ourselves into political politics without being in a sense political enough After debating the proposed letter the bishops will return it to the committee that drafted it to complete by next spring It will then be distributed to Catholics nationwide as guidance on the nuclear issue In taking an antinuclear stand the bishops want to be seen and heard as witnesses for peace said the Rev J Bryan Hehir head of the international justice and peace office for the United States Catholic Conference They want to be seen as clearly condemning the direction of the arms race and to support the statement of their president that we must say no to nuclear warfare He was referring to Archbishop John R Roach of Minneapolis At the same time Father Hehir said the bishops are not at the same place with regard to the complicated matter of deterrence Increased Social Involvement The activist approach to war and peace by the 285 active members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops fits a more general heightening of social involvement Among other things the bishops have fought abortion criticized American policy in Central America and advocated aid for the poor Bishops have to be involved in issues of public order said Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit a leader of Pax Christi a Catholic peace movement that includes 55 bishops We cant dodge that responsibility as we sometimes did in the past Since the Second Vatican Council called for a new look at the issue of war and peace bishops in this country have expressed growing concern over the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and have closely followed papal pleas for activism on behalf of peace The surge toward agreement on many elements of an antinuclear stance can be traced to several landmark events A major pastoral letter Human Life in Our Day in 1968 addressed many areas of war and peace By 1971 the bishops decided that the Vietnam War was not defensible by the standards of the justwar theory and they upheld the right of conscientious objection I think the turning point was the bishops attitude toward Vietnam said Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee It came late but it caused the bishops to look more carefully at the US position in the world The fight against liberalized abortion conducted on the basis that all life is sacred carried over into the hierarchys attitudes toward the detructiveness of war Past Letters on Military Policy In another pastoral letter in 1976 the bishops declared that both the use of nuclear weapons and the declared intent to use those weapons against civilian targets was wrong In 1978 the bishops backed the proposed treaty on limitation of strategic arms and in a dramatic turning point John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia delivered their decision in a strong antinuclear statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee The entrance of Cardinal Krol a respected conservative into the antinuclear issue is considered extremely important His word carried weight not only in affirming the bishops stand but by rallying much conservative support to further examination of the issues of war and peace The cardinals antinuclear position has been strongly expressed on several occasions since last years bishops meeting Meanwhile papal statements have increasingly emphasized the need for bilateral accords on disarmament and an end to the arms race By 1980 the climate among the bishops strongly suggested that they were prepared to deal more extensively with the issue in the form of a pastoral letter At their annual meeting that year four bishops rose to address their concerns about the growing nuclear threat As they finished ripples of applause began quietly then became louder and sustained By the summer of 1981 the committee had been formed made up of bishops of differing positions and they began formulating their consensus

BISHOPS' REMARKS ON PASTORAL LETTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/us/bishops-remarks-on-pastoral-letter.html,Following are excerpts from the comments of Roman Catholic bishops on a proposed pastoral letter on war and peace John R Roach Archbishop of St Paul and Minneapolis Like everybody else we bishops are sometimes inconsistent the practical implications of doctrine are not always immediately apparent to us the doctrinal roots of our social and political convictions are not always easy to discover But for the most part and making allowances for particular cases we are much more consistent in our doctrine and our social policy than these critics whether liberal or conservatives are generally willing to allow Indeed somewhat arbitrarily we are usually a good deal more consistent than the critics For the stands we take on social and political questions do in fact arise from and express the doctrine to which we are committed as Catholic bishops Therefore we are not only concerned about the potential victims of violence  whether it be the violence of war or the violence of abortion we are also concerned about those  ourselves included  who may become guilty of unjust violence either by perpetrating it or acquiescing in it For people establish their moral identities precisely by the commitments they make and the policies they endorse in matters which impact upon fundamental human values such as life Task Is Complex It is a truism to say that this is a complex task Less obvious perhaps is that much of its complexity arises from this fact The question is not just whether a particular approach to deterrence does or does not deter we must also consider whether a particular deterrent strategy in and of itself does or does not involve us individually and collectively in an immoral commitment Not only are there moral limits on what can be done in waging war there are also moral limits on what can be accepted in the name of deterrence We have a rich opportunity to call and lead a nation to the high road of the peace of Jesus Christ The mere publication of the Pastoral will never capture that opportunity Our Pastoral states that we have two purposes to help Catholics form their consciences and to contribute to the public policy debate about the morality of war Armed with our Pastoral whatever its final form it will be your burden and mine to lead people to a new religious vision of peace Joseph L Bernardin Archbishop of Chicago Our pastoral letter is designed precisely to cultivate an enlightened public opinion about the awesome questions posed by modern warfare The wider public debate of the new moment involves many voices the policies of governments the perspectives of scientists and physicians the concerns fears and hopes of our parishioners We seek as American Catholic bishops to make a contribution to this new moment for we are convinced the world of the Gospel and witness of the Church cannot be isolated from this question As American Catholic bishops we teach in a particular context Our nation is one of the few nuclear states one of two nuclear superpowers and the only country to have used nuclear weapons Pastoral ministry in this setting includes special responsibilities for the Church in the United States We are conscious that there are two superpowers that the policies of both create the arms race and that the history and posture of the Soviet Union is the principal reason why the United States maintains its nuclear arsenal All of these facts are relevant but none of them relieves us of the responsibility we have as American bishops to spell out the implications of Catholic teaching on modern warfare for our government and our society On the nuclear question the second draft of the pastoral letter echoes the message of the Holy Father and of the recent extraordinary meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Science and National Academies of Science from around the world The message is that the danger of nuclear war is great the present direction of the arms race intensifies the danger the moral political economic and human costs of the arms race are intolerable and the imperative of the moment is a deep and substantial change in policy personal perception and practice which will begin a process of authentic disarmament As American Catholic bishops we say this to our government and our society but it is a message equally applicable to others Use and Deterrence The heart of the moral analysis of the pastoral is based on one premise which then is related to the twin issues of the use of nuclear weapons and the policy of deterrence The premise is rooted in the judgment that nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy as it is conceived today pose a qualitatively new moral and political challenge Three Types of Weapons Use Relating these statements to the question of the use of nuclear weapons we consider three possibilities of use counterpopulation warfare first use of nuclear weapons and the concept of limited nuclear exchange Without rehearsing here our specific arguments in each case I can summarize our intention it is to draw a strong clear line politically and morally against resort to nuclear weapons The analysis of deterrence has been modified and expanded in the second draft Again without repeating the extended argument found in the documentation I will highlight five key points First is the inclusion of Pope John Paul IIs statement on deterrence at the UN Second Special Session on Disarmament Second the pastoral letter restricts the morally acceptable function of deterrence to the one purpose it is said to have had preventing the use of nuclear weapons in any form Third the letter develops criteria for assessing specific elements of deterrence strategy Fourth the second draft uses these criteria for making specific judgments on deterrence strategy and policy opposing some steps and recommending others Fifth throughout the entire discussion of deterrence the letter recognizes those negative elements of nuclear deterrence which make any moral support of it so difficult Specifically it is clear that as Catholic bishops we cannot approve any policy of deterrence which involves an intention to do what is morally evil The moral complexity of deterrence however centers upon three elements the possession of nuclear weapons with massive destructive capability the threat to use these weapons and the intention which undergirds the policy The questions of foreign policy and defense policy are core issues for any state But defense and foreign policy raise moral questions of the highest order problems of taking human life protecting human rights judging the policy of ones nation by criteria of social justice are all central concerns of Catholic moral teaching today The state seeks support it is the churchs responsibility to see to it that the states request is measured in moral terms Terence Cardinal Cooke New York To share with you some of the comments that I have received from people who responded to the consultation process within the Archdiocese of New York and the Military Vicariate Their input which is in this folder gives evidence of much prayer reflection and concern about the threat facing our nation and our world Their comments indicate the great potential which this draft has for seriously dividing our church and our nation In this local consultation as well as in other reactions to this draft throughout our country there has been division on the specifics of the issue we are facing on the possession of nuclear weapons their use the threat of their use and on the whole question of deterence Concern has been expressed that the moral teaching of the Church on the traditional concept of the just war and defense against unjust aggression not be intertwined with political strategic military speculation On the other hand there is a strong unity on one point the world must work toward the elimination of nuclear arms and indeed of all instruments of massive destruction On the basis of the comments received it is my hope that in the final draft our document will be faithful to the teachings of the Holy Fathers of the nuclear age In particular I refer to two statements given within the past year  the World Day of Peace Message of Pope John Paul II and his message to the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on Disarmament which merit our strongest support It is my hope that emphasis be given to the traditional just war teaching of the Church as it has been clearly presented by the Popes from Pius XII to the present A sound theological base well defined and free from consequentialism and false ends justify the means reasoning is needed It is my hope that we reflect a realistic attitude toward the evils of the loss of freedom the oppression of faith and the actual motivation of the leaders of some nations to dominate
CATHOLIC BISHOPS BEGIN ARMS DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/us/catholic-bishops-begin-arms-debate.html,Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Chicago chairman of a special committee of Roman Catholic bishops that drafted a pastoral letter opposing nuclear arms defended the document today as several other bishops asked for key changes in it The proposed letter the main topic of debate at the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops this week opposes both the use and the threat of using nuclear weapons but leaves open the question of whether such weapons could ever be fired in retaliation The letter also calls nuclear war immoral opposes the first use of nuclear weapons supports a twoway verifiable freeze on nuclear arsenals and says deterrence is acceptable only if it is used as a means of negotiating disarmament On the whole most of the 110page statement appeared to have broad support But by the end of the first round of debate major points of conflict had emerged Some favor a total prohibition on nuclear weapons while others would allow their limited possession as a deterrent on condition that they never be used After revisions the letter is scheduled to be issued next spring to Catholics nationwide Reverence for Life Among the first speakers today were Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York who called for greater emphasis on traditional Catholic views on war and Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle who urged the conference to condemn all forms of nuclear defense Archbishop Philip Hanan of New Orleans an outspoken critic of the bishops recent efforts to take an antinuclear stance urged the hierarchy to scrap the letter in favor of a much more general statement by Pope John Paul II to the United Nations last June Earlier Archbishop John R Roach of St Paul and Minneapolis president of the conference and a powerful critic of nuclear arms upheld the need for the bishops to speak on nuclear arms as moral teachers who must maintain a reverence for life For months the committee that prepared the letter grappled primarily with the problem of deterrence the one issue in the document on which the church has yet to take a clear stand A first draft called deterrence as a means to disarmament tolerable but the word acceptable was substituted to conform to the Popes speech to the United Nations special session on disarmament in June Lesser Evil Than War Some bishops defend a strategy of deterrence on the ground that it is a lesser evil than war itself Others contend that an evil activity cannot be a means to a morally justifiable end Another difficulty with tolerating deterrence according to some theologians is that it might allow for compromise on other practices that the church regards as evil such as abortion Much of the present discussion centers on the meaning of the Popes message to the United Nations Some bishops attach a stronger pacifist interpretation to the Pontiffs words than others It appeared today that the bishops were still searching for a formula that would uphold the right of nations to keep a nuclear arsenal to prevent nuclear war while clearly rejecting any use of the weapons Political and Moral Values The committee recognizes the delicacy of the deterrence issue Archbishop Bernardin said We are keenly aware of how important it is that the bishops present in this pastoral a moral theory which is in conformity with the totality of the churchs moral teaching but we believe our conclusion is fundamentally correct and in accord with the judgment on deterrence expressed by Pope John Paul II He went on We are conscious of the political and moral values at stake in this debate But we are even more conscious of the cost of not facing the moral responsibility our nation has in concert with others in the nuclear age Cardinal Cooke in his response favored continued discussion of some elements of the document He said that in consultations he held with Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York as well as in other reactions to this draft throughout the country there has been division on specifics of the issues we are facing on the possession of nuclear weapons their use and on the whole question of deterrence He continued Concern has been expressed that the moral teaching of the church on the traditional concept of the just war and defense against unjust aggression not be intertwined with political strategic and military speculation On the other hand there is a strong unity on one point The world must work toward the elimination of nuclear arms and indeed of all instruments of massive destruction In an interview after the session Cardinal Cooke said he agreed with the views gained through the consultation and voiced confidence that the final document would reflect such emphases Archbishop Hunthausen who has campaigned for a strongly pacifist position favored a stronger antinuclear position that would include a judgment against all nuclear weapons and their possession If we are to proclaim the Gospel he said we must state more clearly that nuclear deterrence is idolatry

U.S. JUDGE IN TEXAS DRAWS WIDESPREAD HOSTILITY WITH LIBERAL RULINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/21/us/us-judge-in-texas-draws-widespread-hostility-with-liberal-rulings.html,It was another quiet Election Day for Federal District Judge William Wayne Justice often described as the most powerful and the most controversial man in eastern Texas a man whose power would vanish quickly if the voters had anything to say about it While others were winning or losing the more transitory powers of elected office Judge Justice was telling a reporter about the only bumper stickers that ever bore his name those calling for his impeachment a few years back A few weeks later he launched another of the judicial thunderbolts that have become his trademark  an order requiring the state to pay 17 million in fees and expenses to lawyers who had successfully challenged conditions in the state prison system It was more than double the largest previous award in a prison conditions case The ruling was not likely to be popular in Texas It drew a quick denunciation from the Texas Attorney General Mark White now the Governorelect But Judge Justice has never courted popularity Our forefathers knew how to give judges some independence Judge Justice said in the Election Day interview referring to the life tenure that insulates him and other Federal judges from majority rule The plain fact of the matter is that the majority is sometimes wrong he once wrote in a law review article Such sentiments have not endeared Judge Justice to the majority or to its elected representatives The outgoing Republican Governor William Clements has called him goofy and has accused him of usurping the powers of the state government Bill Kugle a lawyer in nearby Athens who practiced law with Mr Justice and his father more than 20 years ago and admires much of what he has done said He may be the most unpopular man in Texas Judge Justice is an exemplar of the liberal activist judge championing the rights of minorities against what he calls the tyranny of the majority He has engineered sweeping changes in the state prison and school systems while finding time for such things as ordering Tyler Junior College to admit longhaired males When President Reagan and Attorney General William French Smith denounce activist judges for imposing their policy preferences over legislative decisions they are talking about people like Judge Justice So are civil rights groups when they extol the Federal judiciary as the chief protector and benefactor of minorities And so was Congress when it spent much of the summer debating and ultimately defeating proposals to strip the Federal judiciary of its powers over the social issues of abortion school prayer and busing Meanwhile Judge Justice remains undaunted by the hostility that surrounds him in this bastion of oil wealth and conservative Republicanism Ruled Against Prison System He still presides over the enforcement of his ruling that the entire 30000inmate Texas prison system the countrys largest was unconstitutional because of malignant overcrowding and conditions that constituted cruel and unusual punishment He mandated what may be the most sweeping prison reforms ever imposed by a court by his own estimate those that were upheld on appeal will cost the state well over 1 billion Other still more expensive aspects of his prison reform order were cut back in June by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as overly intrusive into the states management of prisons While upholding Judge Justices basic constitutional ruling the appeals court said he had administered a massive curative dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice In his 14 years on the bench Judge Justice has also desegregated the schools in Tyler issued a sweeping order requiring the state government to eliminate school segregation all over Texas and thrown out various legislative apportionment plans as racially discriminatory He struck down a state law that denied free public education to illegal aliens a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court in June in a 5to4 vote In 1974 he held the states system of institutions for juvenile delinquents unconstitutional closing two of them In 1971 he forced the election of some black cheerleaders at a high school in Tyler that he had desegregated To those who suggest that this showed an unseemly preoccupation with trivia he replies that it was necessary to cool racial hostilities after blacks had staged a mass walkout from the school Friends say they feared for his safety in the Tyler school desegregation battle His chambers received hate mail he received obscene telephone calls and old friends snubbed him and his wife on the street He did not ask for armed guards He took up taekwando the Korean form of karate Aside from the possible need to defend himself he said it was a great way to take out my frustrations you build up a lot of hostilities sitting on the bench all day Judge Justice is one of more than 30 Federal trial judges in Texas but civil rights lawyers jockey to get cases before him A Formal Bookish Man He is an unlikely hero and an unlikely villain A formal bookish elaborately courteous and hospitable man of 62 years he speaks with intellectual excitement about such topics as the influence of the Scottish Renaissance on Thomas Jefferson Though he now tackles a heavy caseload each morning at 7 AM he yearns for the time to take the more leisurely scholarly approach of the appellate judge he would like to be A quiet pride creeps into his voice when he speaks of his father a lawyer famous around eastern Texas for his flamboyance of a greatuncle who was decorated posthumously for bravery in the Confederate Army and of the idealistic young law graduates from around the country who come to clerk for him He also savors his designation this summer by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America as the outstanding Federal trial judge of the year Some of his admirers including former clerks who have become less liberal than they were when they went to Tyler to battle oppression at his side think he sometimes carries a good thing too far The things hes done are morally socially right said Mr Kugle the lawyer who once practiced with him Black people have been kicked around here for a long time and our prisons are a disgrace I do have some concern that he has invaded the legislative process rather farther than I think the judiciary ought to do The Federal appeals court expressed similar concerns this summer both in reversing part of Judge Justices sweeping remedial order in the prison case and in overturning his decision requiring Texas to provide bilingual education to MexicanAmerican children at all grade levels Mr Kugle said one of the judges former law clerks once told me he thinks Wayne wakes up every morning trying to figure out how many people he can get mad at him before the sun goes down that day Asked for his reaction to this assessment Judge Justice laughed heartily Getting a lot of flak because of your decisions just kind of goes with the territory he said on another occasion Thats why they appoint you for life
THEOLOGY GETS DOWN TO CASES ON NUCLEAR ARMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/21/weekinreview/theology-gets-down-to-cases-on-nuclear-arms.html,The nuclear age has ushered in what many of the nations Roman Catholic bishops call a new moment in moral theology that demands a fresh way of thinking about the ethics of war and peace Last week at its annual meeting in Washington the National Conference of Catholic Bishops took decisive steps to draft a pastoral letter that solidifies the churchs opposition to nuclear arms tentatively stakes out some new ground on deterrence and in general reflects a striking change in attitude The bishops stance as contained in the second draft of the letter that unofficially received a twothirds backing calls nuclear war immoral It condemns the use of nuclear arms as well as the threat to use them and allows for their possession only if linked to earnest efforts to achieve negotiated disarmament It also raises doubts about the possibility of fighting limited nuclear war and calls for a bilateral verifiable nuclear freeze Criticism of the document came swiftly from the White House in a letter from William P Clark President Reagans national security adviser Mr Clark tried with little apparent success to convince the bishops that American nuclear policy is compatible with the churchs moral standards Complaints from small groups of conservative Catholics also seem to have had little impact Despite the sudden attention given the draft document much of it reflects stands taken in the past by Popes church councils and the bishops But where earlier statements tended to refer to the general state of the world the American bishops this time spoke too to their homeland and to its military policies That trend has been evident for several years on other issues The bishops are heeding the direction of the Second Vatican Council by applying the broad principles of the universal church to specific issues and in so doing have become bolder critics of their own government By 1971 they were opposing the Vietnam war and within another two years speaking out against the Supreme Courts decision to allow abortion More recently they have decried American military aid to El Salvador fought cuts in aid to the poor and most dramatically rallied against the arms race The common theme is that all life is sacred As Archbishop John R Roach of Minneapolis conference president noted in his opening address Where the value in question is human life the linkages go far beyond the surface and deeply influence the whole cast of our moral lives Selective reverence for human life is a kind of contradiction in terms not only as a matter of logic but also as a matter of existential reality Over the past decade the relevance of that conviction to the arms race has engaged the attention of a growing number of bishops At various points along the way certain bishops have led the movement in an evolutionary direction through timely encouragement or example Among the landmarks was the testimony favoring SALT II by John Cardinal Krol before a Senate subcommittee in 1978 Many believe the intervention by Cardinal Krol a respected conservative from Philadelphia helped foster a change in direction among many who had been reluctant to move away from the churchs just war tradition Other bishops have set the tone and moved the issue along in their own dioceses Among them were Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston who conducted talks with scholars from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard before writing his own pointed assault on nuclear weapons and Bishop Walter Sullivan of Richmond Va who became an outspoken critic of United States policy Then there was the leadership of Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin of Chicago as head of the special committee entrusted with drafting the pastoral letter The bishops called for such a letter at their 1980 meeting and many at this years session showed signs of having undergone a recent conversion A few bishops still balked but the vast majority were clearly on a course that surprised many in and out of the church Their resolve was echoed in an apparent rebuff of the Administrations criticism by Bishop Sullivan who called on the conference to stay the course for peace On most every major point the bishops stood together The one area where they were challenged to go beyond previous church statements on nuclear arms concerned the justification for nuclear deterrence At issue was what Pope John Paul II meant when he said that possessing nuclear weapons could be morally acceptable if tied to sincere efforts to bring about disarmament The problems were twofold One was that a questionable means a nuclear stockpile was being justified in the service of a patently good end maintaining peace To some that was a moral contradiction Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee asked the Vatican to provide clear definitions The other problem was the feeling among many bishops that the Reagan Administration has not sincerely pursued negotiated arms reductions with the Russians Thus present United States nuclear deterrence cannot be justified Bishop Raymond Lucker of Wisconsin expressed that conviction on the floor The view is still considered radical among the bishops but it raises the question and in the opinion of some has placed pressure on the Administration to demonstrate good faith efforts Far from the bishops being influenced by the Administration some bishops believe the White House could increasingly respond to the moral arguments set forth by the churchs hierarchy At the risk of being called naive or accused of meddling in matters beyond their competence the bishops spoke boldly of being peacemakers Warned that their actions could divide the church they showed no inclination to back down Bishop Kenneth Untener of Saginaw Mich said he had mailed copies of the draft letter to 18000 members of his diocese and was convinced from the response that it was an instrument of peace A Gallup survey released today indicates that the bishops have solid backing from the nations 50 million Catholics on their proposal for a nuclear freeze It shows Catholics favoring a bilateral freeze 82 percent to 13 percent with 5 percent undecided At the same time they narrowly reject a universal freeze by 53 percent to 47 percent The bishops left Washington committed to voting on a final version in May There was little likelihood that differences over the morality of deterrence could be ironed out to everyones satisfaction but the bishops seemed content to live with the disagreements Declaring our top priority must be the disarmament of the human spirit Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco called on the conference to endeavor to bring about the creation of a psychology of peace
RACES SAID TO TURN ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/21/archives/races-said-to-turn-on-abortion.html,WHITE PLAINS IF Lehrman had been prochoice he would have won in Westchester and New York State Polly W Rothstein director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion said in a postelection statement last week If George Morrow had not taken the Right to Life line he would have been reelected According to Mrs Rothstein the coalitions efforts not only provided the winning margin for Governorelect Mario Cuomo and County Clerkelect Andrew Spano but also accounted for a loss by fewer than 2000 votes for Suzi Oppenheimer a Democrat in her contest with the Republican incumbent State Senator Joseph Pisani and for reduced margins of victory for Republican judicial candidates running with Right to Life support In the county and nationwide Mrs Rothstein said the political winds have shifted to favor the prochoice side One of the candidates cited Mrs Oppenheimer came to the coalitions office Tuesday to back up the groups claim to influence In addition to 2000 in financial support she said the coalition provided her with volunteers and helped prepare campaign literature on the abortion issue which she termed very valuable The proabortion issue Mrs Oppenheimer said was one on which she and Senator Pisani differed strongly Nevertheless her opponent indicated growing recognition of the proabortion factor by issuing a flyer late in the campaign indicating moderation of his previous strong antiabortion stand Not present at the news conference but represented by letters of acknowledgement were Mr Cuomo who called the group an important part of a coalition of womens movement groups that made a difference in the outcome of the 1982 election and Mr Spano whose narrow victory over the incumbent Mr Morrow makes him the first Democrat elected County Clerk for a generation or more While no one factor was decisive in the outcome Mr Spano wrote it is my personal opinion that my opponents acceptance of the RTL line was one of the significant factors in my victory He called the proabortion position consistent with the prevalent feeling that citizens seem to have today for the removal of government interference in their personal lives and credited the coalitions voters guide with alerting voters to the dangers of singleissue parties Concluding on a note of disapproval Mr Spano wrote I dont know what abortion had to do with the County Clerks office and I hope in the future that those politicians who run for judicial and administrative offices where the issue is not appropriate think twice about its effect on the outcome of the election Senator Pisani asked for comment later vigorously challenged the coalitions contention He conceded that the proabortion effort in some of their very distorted and erroneous publicity had contributed to narrowing the gap of his victory But the major factor he said was the expenditure of more than 150000 by the Democrats on Mrs Oppenheimers behalf His own expenditures he said were half that Mr Pisani said he had never advocated punishment or recrimination for women who had abortions He supported an amendment to the state budget to eliminate funds for abortion under Medicaid but declined to hold other expenditures hostage by voting against the entire budget when the amendment was defeated What he does favor the Senator said is a statewide referendum on abortion  whose result he would accept as binding In the MorrowSpano contest the defeated incumbent said he didnt know whether the coalitions claim to decisive influence was accurate and that he doubted if anyone could say for sure While citing the 8000 to 9000 votes for him on the Right to Life line Mr Morrow acknowledged that opposition to candidates on that line was also very strong The proabortion contingent was very well organized he said and the Right to Life group was not organized at all they didnt seem to put on any kind of campaign While he is personally against abortion Mr Morrow said I would never force those personal beliefs on anyone I believe it is a womans choice it is up to her and her conscience And he echoed Mr Spano on the irrelevance of the issue to the County Clerks job I always felt my office had nothing to do with it If I had been running for a legislative office I would probably not have accepted RTL endorsement Mrs Rothstein said she believed that the major parties would be likely to avoid antiabortion candidates in the future Asked whether Right to Life might regain the momentum it appeared to have lost this year she discounted the possibility The number of active proabortion people she said has increased steadily whereas Right to Lifes hard core has remained stable or shrunk The coalitions Political Action Committee spent 40000 during the campaign Mrs Rothstein reported with the money coming from 1550 contributors The largest amount 20000 went toward mailing 150000 voters guides another 7000 was given to candidates generally in modest grants of 500 or so and 7000 was spent on advertising Because few recipients of financial help had been given much chance of winning Mrs Rothstein said the groups wonlost ratio would have no significance Questioned about the defeat of a Family Court candidate John Sherlock the only Republican judicial candidate to decline Right to Life endorsement Mrs Rothstein said I cant explain it The winner in that race Barbara Kaiser a Democrat had also been endorsed by the coalition

A BAD NIGHT FOR BOXING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/29/sports/a-bad-night-for-boxing.html,IF Randy Cobb were a bear instead of a boxer the humane societies would be protesting the public bloodying he suffered Friday night Picture a bear in a small enclosure being pounded from all sides while it lumbered forward for more Thats cruelty to animals Put yellow trunks and striped socks on the victim and call it a sport licensed by the State of Texas and sent into living rooms by ABC The victory by Larry Holmes a skilled and decent champion was the latest abomination from the socalled sweet science It follows the death of Duk Koo Kim and the brutal knockout of Alexis Arguello two weeks ago The grim picture from Houston was made even more seedy by Don King the promoter who found a way to take money back from Cobb for tardiness and even tried to shake down Holmes because King had committed himself to a financial stinker The domination of boxing by King and Bob Arum is reason to at least send in the Federal agents and more properly to end this vicious business However while we examine boxing let us not forget that people like Holmes Ray Mancini Eddie Futch Angelo Dundee John Condon Ray Leonard and Arguello are fine human beings To criticize the business is in no way to demean them Well the argument goes if you dont like it you dont have to watch it But boxing is part of the world in which we live For a journalist to not examine boxing would be to ignore the screams on the next block that may or may not signal a mugging The latest sanctioned mugging took place Friday night with the good Howard Cosell on duty Not the bad Howard Cosell who hypes dull games on Monday nights but the man who calls himself a journalist and reads and thinks and feels Terrible Cosell muttered adding From the point of view of boxing which is under attack and deservedly so this fight could not have come at a worse time In the 14th round as Holmes flailed away at his bloodied hulk of an opponent Cosell said I wonder if that referee understands he is constructing evidence for the abolition of the very sport he is part of Howard accumulated all the right evidence but the former lawyer indulged in a form of pleabargaining By criticizing the referee and the mismatching of opponents Cosell avoided going for the maximum sentence the end of boxing It is time The time came two weeks ago when Duk Koo Kims brain was shortcircuited by one punch in a ring in Las Vegas Nev not by a mismatch not by the slowness of a referee but by the very essence of the sport  hitting people on the head The time for ending boxing came when customers stood and cheered while Duk Koo Kim toppled and fell They were cheering death Later boxing people and fans and writers said in chorus Aw he was supposed to take a punch in the head fall down for a while then get back up and shake hands He wasnt supposed to die Well thats the breaks of the game Only good luck and a hard cranium saved Randy Cobb a barroom brawler who is proud of never having been knocked off his feet Cobbs natural courage has been augmented by hypnosis Terrific Just what boxing needs are boxers in a hypnotic state who think they cant be knocked down Theyll still be throwing punches in the funeral parlor While Cobb was absorbing a beating that could leave permanent damage 56 percent of all longtime fighters suffer chaotic brain impulses according to a study done for the province of Quebec Don King fined him 28 percent of his purse 200000  for having arrived 10 days late for publicity duties This robberybycontract compounded by Kings proposal that Holmes kick back some money because of low gate receipts is further proof that boxing should not be left to the auspices of feudal barons This is probably the wrong Administration to be asked to care about what is done in the pursuit of a buck but some concerned government official should find a way to send in the Federal men When Duk Koo Kim was killed a reader Rita Calvo wrote a letter asking how to end the madness of boxing once and for all Two suggestions  New York State residents might ask Governorelect Mario Cuomo an athlete and admirable opponent of the death penalty how he felt about boxing in the state State legislators might be pressured to investigate this grim business  Beer companies and other sponsors are taking the consumers money and spending it on boxing They are vulnerable in two ways poor public image and loss of sales The networks must acknowledge their role  and profit  from public beatings The response in the sports pages since the death of Kim has been interesting One of the best sports journalists said he would pull the plug on boxing if he could but added that this is not a perfect world Wasnt this country founded on the premise that things could often be changed  revolutionized Some writers have cited Camus or Hemingway or journalists of the past as if the literature validated the subject Some of the greatest literature has come from observing war homicide and exploitation without advocating them Goya sketched war he didnt lead cheers for it Some journalists have defended boxing on the ground that people have the right to choose their destiny Not exactly Society has the right to set some rules When a man dangles from a window ledge the police try to pull him back We dont let promoters sell tickets in the street below Other journalists have defended boxing because of its great characters and because boxing is a way up from poverty This approach has always struck me as a bit of intellectual slumming There are characters everywhere in and out of sports but a few characters and a few success stories do not justify human beings cheering a lethal blow to the brain This is a time of concern over nuclear proliferation of honest debate over abortion and capital punishment Americans can still make things better in the past decade it has become possible to enter many public buildings without having to inhale other peoples cigarette smoke This is also a time when people are discovering better health through diet and exercise It is also time to ask whether it is healthy for society to condone and license bloody public beatings  also known as boxing

ABORTION RESTRICTION CASES ARGUED BEFORE HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/us/abortion-restriction-cases-argued-before-high-court.html,The abortion issue returned to the Supreme Court today For three hours the Justices heard arguments on the constitutionality of various obstacles that state and local governments have placed in the path of women seeking abortions in the nearly 10 years since the Court declared that the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion The five cases the products of challenges to state laws in Virginia and Missouri and to a local ordinance in Akron Ohio concerned the constitutionality of such measures as hospitalization requirements for abortions performed in the second three months of pregnancy parental or judicial consent requirements for abortions performed on minors and a requirement that a woman seeking an abortion be told that the procedure can result in severe emotional disturbances Most of the issues were common to several of the cases As a result the long argument often seemed to lack focus as seven lawyers examined the issues in sequence The Justices gave little or no indication that they intend to use any of the cases as a vehicle for reexamining the basic premise of Roe v Wade the major 1973 abortion ruling The Courts decision will be issued before the term closes in late June or early July Administrations Argument Made One of the few moments of drama today came in the 10minute presentation by Solicitor General Rex E Lee who argued in behalf of the Reagan Administration that the Court should change the legal standard by which it assesses the constitutionality of abortion regulations Mr Lee said the Court should no longer presume as it had for the last decade that restrictions on access to abortion were unconstitutional unless justified by a compelling state interest Instead he said the Court should exhibit a greater deference to the policy choices made by legislatures Are you asking that Roe v Wade be overruled Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun the author of the landmark decision asked Mr Lee No I am not the Governments chief Supreme Court advocate replied It seems to me Justice Blackmun said in a near whisper that your brief asks either that or the overruling of Marbury v Madison He was referring to the 1803 decision that established the Supreme Courts power to rule on the constitutionality of action by other branches of government Decision Still for Courts No Mr Lee replied he was not making such a radical request because at the end of the day the ultimate decision is still for the courts Holding the Governments brief in the air Justice Blackmun glared down at the Solicitor General Did you write this brief personally he asked Very substantial parts of it Mr Lee replied A theme common to all the cases was the constitutional significance if any of the improved abortion techniques that have come into common use since 1973 In Roe v Wade the Court indicated that because of the increased medical risk of secondtrimester abortions it might well be permissible for states to restrict these procedures to hospitals At that time secondtrimester abortions were typically performed by inducing labor through the injection of various chemicals The published standards of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as other medical organizations called for the procedure to be performed only in hospitals Rules of Physicians Changed Since then a method known as dilatation and evacuation has made later abortions considerably safer The obstetricians group recently changed its rules to permit most secondtrimester abortions to be performed in outpatient clinics as well as hospitals William G Broaddus Chief Deputy Attorney General of Virginia told the Court that the medical developments had no bearing on the validity of Virginias hospitalization requirement It is not incumbent on Virginia to finetune its statute to facilitate abortions he said Associate Justice John Paul Stevens asked the Virginia official whether any other Virginia laws explicitly limited other types of surgery to hospitals I am not aware of any Mr Broaddus answered So under Virginia law a surgeon could perform brain surgery at home I suppose Justice Stevens said He Rejects Impact of Technology Justice Stevens addressed the same question to John Ashcroft the Missouri Attorney General who argued that the new technology should have no effect on that states hospitalization requirement because the state ought to have leeway to err on the side of safety in an area that remained a subject of continuing medical debate Are there any other areas of medical debate on which the Missouri legislature has opted on one side or another Justice Stevens asked Are there any other operations you must do in a hospital I am not aware of any the Attorney General replied But Mr Ashcroft answered yes when Chief Justice Warren E Burger asked whether he thought the state legislature could constitutionally require all childbirth except for emergencies to take place in a hospital That would be a little hard to enforce wouldnt it Justice Stevens observed Defense of Akron Provision The Akron ordinance which contains an informed consent section requiring doctors to tell women that the fetus is a human life from the moment of conception was defended by Alan G Segedy as one of the finest examples of the legislative process Mr Segedy said that the ordinance which was declared unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court creates no burden on the decision of the woman but rather is choiceenhancing Stephan Landsman arguing on behalf of the abortion clinics that challenged the ordinance said that the provision requires women to consider misinformation and turns the physician into an adversary rather than an adviser

AKRON'S 1978 RULES WERE ENJOINED ALMOST AT START,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/us/akron-s-1978-rules-were-enjoined-almost-at-start.html,After several young rock fans were suffocated by the crush at a Cincinnati rock concert several years ago the Akron City Council adopted a crowdcontrol ordinance A law limiting the sale of drug and marijuana paraphernalia followed complaints about the appearance of those items in some store windows Recently when parents complained that their children spent too much time and money playing video games the council passed a law restricting the spread of video arcades The opening of abortion clinics in Akron in the mid1970s prompted a new outcry that led to a 1978 law restricting abortions The fact is its a parttime City Council and they dont have very much to do Deputy Mayor David Pagnard commented stressing that he spoke as an individual not officially They spend a lot of time reacting to social phenomena Its something you get in small cities and Akron is just big enough to have abortion clinics but small enough to have this mentality It Did Not Pass Away But instead of passing into obscurity like earlier attempts at controls on social and cultural currents the Akron abortion statute has become the focus of what has been called the most serious challenge to the unrestricted right to abortions in the nearly 10 years that abortions have been legal in this country The Akron ordinance adopted amid considerable dispute and by some reports with an approaching mayoral election in mind includes an informed consent requirement It also required women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours before the operation after being told by the doctor that the procedure can be dangerous that it can cause infertility and psychological problems and that the fetus can experience pain Critics of the law charged immediately that its purpose was to discourage women from having abortions by giving them what the critics regard as medically contestable information Was it to discourage abortions Alan Segedy counsel for the Ohio Right to Life Society who is author of the statute asked It was to the extent that we feel that a certain number of women if they were given certain information about the unborn child would elect not to have an abortion And if that woman has time to think it over she might not go through with it Mayor Did Not Sign Ordinance The ordinance was passed by a vote of 7 to 6 and allowed to become law without the signature of Mayor John S Ballard who said he would leave the laws constitutionality which he doubted to the courts The first and only public opinion test on the law took place the following year when Ray Kapper the Council President a Democrat and the measures sponsor ran for mayor against Roy L Ray a Republican Members of Mayor Rays administration believe Mr Kapper was persuaded that his support for the abortion law would insure his election but Mr Ray a relative newcomer trounced him I think the people of Akron can take credit for defeating Kapper because of the stand he took on this issue said Carol Wall director of the Akron chapter of Planned Parenthood an opponent of the ordinance Injunction Was Immediate A prompt challenge to the new ordinance by the American Civil Liberties Union brought an immediate injunction with the result that none of the key elements in the law has yet seriously affected the practice of abortion in Akron According to the City Health Department in 1981 a total of 7685 abortions were performed in Akron as against 6507 live births in the city which has a population of 237000 Of the abortions 1843 were performed for Akron women The rest were for women from outside the city People who favor legal abortion cite this as showing the importance of Akrons five abortion clinics to women living in rural eastcentral Ohio By the summer of 1981 the law reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati where a threejudge panel voting 2 to 1 invalidated the informed consent and 24hour waiting period It also eliminated these other provisions  One that required girls 15 years old or younger to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge  One that required the physician to inform a woman seeking an abortion about agencies available to help her have a live birth and to place the baby for adoption  One specifying humane and sanitary disposal of the fetus Mayor Decides to Appeal The matter might have rested there had not Mayor Ray as yet untouched by the controversy which arose before his administration announced in October 1981 that he would appeal the measure to the Supreme Court and the issue was joined at the national level The American Medical Association the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other leading medical groups condemned the laws informed consent section as resting on untrue medical assumptions The Reagan Administration joined Akron in a friend of the court brief urging the justices to give heavy deference to local abortion regulations The decision to appeal surprised many of the Mayors supporters one of whom commented that he had taken up a nowin problem that the Court of Appeals ruling if undisturbed would have put to rest I personally am not happy with abortion being the focus of this issue Mayor Ray said in an interview I inherited the problem but in my official capacity as Mayor I felt I had to do it

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/02/garden/hers.html,WORD having gotten around that I was at work on a novel about abortion I was continually surprised by women who volunteered information about themselves They too they felt I should know had had abortions It was never lightly said  always gravely as if imparting a trust yet always surprisingly spontaneously the pentup information sought its own way toward release Sometimes the women who told were older and the years fell away from them as they spoke to reveal a pain still fresh Sometimes younger and then there was bravado I feel much better now Sometimes this was followed by a statement whose vehemence I might have thought misplaced if I hadnt heard it so often Im breaking up with my boyfriend  Ive had it with him Its a big world and on some days so many opposing things go on so many opposing voices are raised that they appear to cancel one another out The world takes on the image of a kind of Penelopefigure weaving and unweaving making and unmaking Everybody talks about the weather Mark Twain complained but nobody does anything about it Nowadays the subject of making babies seems to have replaced talk of the weather with one great difference  everybody wants to do something about babymaking Since legal abortion it seems to me is preferable to the evils involved in either illegal abortion or the birthing of unwanted children I am firmly prochoice But sometimes I can sympathize with the antichoice people A million abortions a year in America alone seems too much like another one of those sickening numbers of the 20th century whose specialty has been mass death No one wants abortions to go on and on Everyone wishes they would end  that some honorable means could be found for a woman to maintain herself in an unmothering status if she wishes some means to which celibacy is not the only key Because of all the attention lavished on the tugofwar between pro and antichoice forces other aspects of the babymaking subject may have gone unnoticed  aspects that point toward proliferation of life in a way that should be satisfying to the antiabortionist although as it turns out it is not There is for example the California Repository for Germinal Choice in Escondido which holds in its icy grip the frozen semen of Nobel Prize winners Last July Newsweek reported that the first woman to make a withdrawal from the Nobel Prizewinners sperm bank had already lost custody of two natural children after allegations of child abuse The new baby daughter has already been born and a picture snapped of mother and child cheek to cheek She and her husband have promised threatened that the new genius will be taught alphabet and numbers before it can walk and trained on computers by the time it is 3 The famous story about George Bernard Shaw comes to mind Approached by a woman who wished to have a child by him that would have his brains and her beauty he replied But what if it has my beauty and your brains What punishments might this First Mother of the Spermbank care to devise for a genius that may not deliver The obvious contrast that comes to mind is with the heavy artillery thats brought to bear on abortion by antichoice forces In the interest of the unborn child everybody feels the right to some say Why is it that in the case of the alleged child abuser who can now take one half of her unborn child from the public domain no one appears to have much to say Life magazine of November 1982 reports that in Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne Australia donor eggs provided by third parties and fertilized by husbands are transplanted into wombs of their wives Some of these concepti are frozen for future use by whomever will claim them In the same issue we see pictures of how at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk Va which has a waiting list of 7000 in vitro babies are made The egg is removed from the mothertobe fertilized in a dish by sperm from the husband and the fertilized egg later transplanted to the wifes uterus Ten or 12 happy wives sunning and chatting wait their turn or rest afterward to make sure the implantation takes But despite a 1979 report commissioned by the Department of Health Education and Welfare affirming the ethics of in vitro fertilization Life reports the United States Government has held up funding The church is opposed So is Jerry Falwell One can see why If procreation can be detached from lovemaking then lovemaking can also be detached from procreation But for most people that has already happened and it does not seem likely that the world will be persuaded to give up contraception Still  there it is Now children can be conjured out of air so to say An egg can be removed from a female placed in a dish and fertilized by extracted sperm and the fertilized egg can be inserted well where Back into the uterus of the woman who produced the egg Or of an adoptive female who wishes to bear and rear the child Or in a donor female body volunteered or paid for Children have been born of this dish conception The fetus has been loosed from the female Biology may be destiny but not in the ways anyone thought Nobel prize winner sperm banks in vitro concepti surrogate mothers  technology advances and as usual brings us along with its blessings something to offend everybody If God wanted sperm to be frozen one can almost hear Jerry Falwell say He would have provided two pair of testicles one regenerative and one refrigerative Meanwhile in the Radcliffe Quarterly of September 1982 we read the news that Mother Teresa was invited to address Radcliffes graduating seniors at Class Day Mother Teresa the Quarterly reports made a bid for virginity The Quarterly quoted her as having said to the seniors that on your wedding day  the most beautiful thing is to give a virgin heart a virgin body a virgin soul The reporter a member of the graduating class of 1983 added in straightfaced language Many questioned the appropriateness of the choice of Mother Teresa as Class Day speaker All the same Mother Teresa was heard by 20000 people that day Who knows where influence made its mark Im not betting money that the world will go either way Yet I do remember the young woman who told me so bravely of her abortion which had taken seemingly only one day out of her lifeIt was nothing  it was over like that She snapped her fingers Just in and out of that room in minutes Then without my asking a question this followed I made up my mind while I was lying there Im going to change my life I quit my job I broke up with my boyfriend Im moving in with my parents and going back to school No drugs no booze Nothing This time Im not going to blow it Mother Teresa may yet get her wish though not exactly this is how it is with wishes the way she wished for it
PACKWOOD LOSES PARTY JOB IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/03/us/packwood-loses-party-job-in-senate.html,With the active support of the White House Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana today was chosen to head the National Republican Senatorial Committee in a vote in which he defeated the incumbent Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon Mr Packwood a critic of President Reagan had held the job for four of the last six years With all 54 Republican Senators voting the tally was 29 to 25 The White House tried to keep its involvement in the fight quiet out of fear that independentminded senators would resent the intrusion in their internal affairs After the vote some lawmakers played down the influence of the Reagan Administration It was about a wash Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader insisted The White House helped in some cases and hurt in others But Administration officials who did not want to be identified acknowledged that the White House had encouraged Mr Lugar to seek the job The Administration also campaigned vigorously for him through a surrogate Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada President Reagans close friend and the new chairman of the Republican National Committee Mr Laxalt nominated Mr Lugar today a clear sign of White House interest Moreover Administration officials said that Mr Laxalt passed the word privately that both he and the President would feel more comfortable working with Senator Lugar in 1984 when Mr Reagan and 19 Republican Senators will face reelection Aint No Pushover Senator Laxalts appointment to lead the Republican National Committee indicates that Reagan loyalists want greater control over the party apparatus as 1984 approaches The victory of Mr Lugar who was on President Reagans list of VicePresidential possibilities in 1980 solidifies the influence of the Reagan wing But Mr Lugar who won his second term last month aint no pushover in the words of Senator Rudy Boschwitz Republican of Minnesota Mr Lugar pushed a bill over White House objections this year that would have allocated 5 billion to stimulate the lagging housing industry The legislation was passed by Congress but was vetoed by Mr Reagan The head of the senatorial campaign committee helps raise money and sets the tone for party election efforts He is also considered a member of the party leadership in the Senate and thus attends weekly meetings with the President and other White House officials Had Clashed With President Mr Packwood who is 50 years old and serving his third Senate term is considered more liberal than President Reagan and Senator Lugar and he has differed sharply with the White House on several key issues He led the losing fight against the Administrations proposal to sell Airborne Warning and Control System radar airplanes to Saudi Arabia but he was more successful in helping to thwart efforts endorsed by the White House to restrict womens rights to have abortions Mr Packwood has also accused Republican Party leaders of ignoring blacks women Jews and other voting groups He caused considerable consternation in the White House when he told a reporter that Mr Reagan sometimes did not follow arguments well and replied to advice with pointless anecdotes All this independence won Senator Packwood few friends in the Republican hierarchy It didnt seem like a team when the Senate leadership came to the White House said one Administration official It was always the leadership plus Packwood Packwoods Supporters Critical There were also criticisms that Mr Packwood had used the campaign committee which dispensed 48 million over the last two years to increase his own visibility Several senators said Mr Lugars cause was aided by the belief that the job should rotate every two years and enjoy the input of fresh blood But Mr Packwoods supporters expressed concern that his loss would remove the only moderate voice from the party leadership in the Senate and at a news conference today Mr Packwood repeated his argument that the Republican Party had failed to appeal to many voting groups He noted that in last months elections Republican candidates won a majority among only one voting group those earning more than 40000 a year Party myopia he asserted was particularly damaging in the case of women Many officials in the upper councils of the Republican Party still feel that women shouldnt be working Mr Packwood said adding that in todays world that attitude was potentially disastrous Speaking at the same conference Mr Lugar acknowledged that Republicans could do better in attracting women to the party But he stressed that economic recovery is absolutely vital for our party in 1984 As expected the Senate Republicans today reelected Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee as majority leader Senate Democrats unanimously reelected Robert C Byrd of West Virginia as minority leader Meanwhile Senator John C Stennis of Mississippi used his seniority to take over the ranking minority position on the Appropriations Committee Mr Stennis who is 81 years old gave up his ranking seat on the Armed Services Committee to Senator Henry M Jackson of Washington Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts a proponent of a nuclear weapons freeze was expected to take a seat on the Armed Services Committee
IN THE NATION; REAGAN AND 1984,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/05/opinion/in-the-nation-reagan-and-1984.html,On the Monday after unemployment rose above 10 percent the Dow Jones average broke 1000 On the day the Commerce Department announced that unemployment had reached 108 percent President Reagans political advisers let it be known that they had begun to plan his reelection campaign Its a strange year Mr Reagan has not yet said  or perhaps decided  that he will run again But he let the planning meeting go forward and his friend Senator Laxalt said he accepted the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee only because he believed the President would seek reelection But by any conventional standard the highest unemployment level since 1940 is not the best platform for a President to run upon And even though the election is nearly two years away that number may not sink by then to politically acceptable levels Martin Feldstein the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers said recently that it would take five years to get unemployment down to 6 or 7 percent without reigniting inflation All of which should make Mr Reagan wince when he recalls his own campaign joke from 1980 A recession he liked to say then was when your neighbor lost his job a depression was when you lost your job and recovery would be when the President lost his Still as far as the economy is concerned Mr Reagan and his advisers have several reasons to feel not confident but comfortable about 1984 in the phrase of Richard Wirthlin the Presidents polltaker For one thing exit polls taken on election day this year showed that about as many voters as held Mr Reagan responsible actually blamed the Democrats for hard economic times That probably reflected the Presidents persuasive arguments for his economic program but it also suggests a troubled belief among voters that the Democrats dont have an alternative other than a return to the policies Mr Reagan has done such an effective job of condemning And though the Republicans lost ground in the 1982 elections there was little evidence of a wholesale swing back to the Democrats on economic or any other grounds When the sharp November rise in unemployment was announced moveover once again the Democrats were ready with nothing more than loud calls for a new jobs program  despite the prospect of a 1983 deficit climbing toward 200 billion despite Mr Reagans promise to veto and despite recent political evidence that such expedients look to many voters like the same old Democratic medicine in which theyve lost confidence Besides Mr Wirthlin suggested to Hedrick Smith of The New York Times economic trends may be favorable for the President by 1984 If inflation is under 6 percent and unemployment and interest rates are declining even slowly Mr Reagan will be able to argue plausibly that his programs have proved their longterm efficacy and should not be exchanged for profligate Democratic spending policies In fact another issue on which Mr Reagan capitalized in 1980  the nations alleged military weakness could be more of a problem for him in 1984 than the economy It was one thing to promise to make the United States No 1 again but its quite another to spend the kind of money Mr Reagan has committed to the military at a time when the economy is stagnant millions of people are out of work and the budget deficit is all but out of control The difficulty Mr Reagan is having in persuading Congress to buy the MX missile and his ludicrous attempt to disguise its 10 warheads by calling it the peacekeeper the efforts gathering force in Congress to cut back his defense budget the refusal of the Soviet Union to back down from the Administrations military bluster and the growing antinuclear movement the President has tried so hard to dissuade or discredit  all suggest that he may find military issues far less profitable politically the next time around Besides the single biggest issue Mr Reagan had going for him in 1980 the publics eagerness to dump Jimmy Carter  has disappeared To the extent that the socalled social issues  abortion school prayer and the like  won him votes in 1980 four years of inability to advance these causes substantially should neutralize them in a Reagan reelection campaign But Mr Reagans popularity if not his job rating remains high and his demeanor attractive to many He has no clear opponent in sight and the impending scramble among hordes of Democrats may do little to endear any of them to the public So Mr Reagans political thinkers are by no means wasting their time as they begin to plan for 1984 Its a reasonably good bet that hell run again as most Presidents do and although its not as easy to reelect a President as it once was Ronald Reagan has shown that hed be a tough contender in any race

MEXICAN LEADER WANTS 'RESPECTFUL' U.S. TIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/06/world/mexican-leader-wants-respectful-us-ties.html,The new President of Mexico Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado said in an interview over the weekend that he wanted cordial and respectful relations with the United States and a more stable trade balance between the two countries But he said that protectionist trends that came up from time to time in the United States made it difficult for Mexico to plan recovery from its present serious economic depression There will be difficult times ahead he said Mexicos inflation rate is approaching 100 percent and its unemployment and underemployment rate is about 40 percent while its population growth is outrunning its economic growth The facts he said require concentration on dramatic new domestic policies before all else It might be he conceded that his economic austerity program could in the short run increase unemployment and encourage the flight of more Mexicans to the United States But he said it was his hope that the development of more laborintensive programs would produce more jobs at home and eventually relieve the pressure on the United States border Population Growth Slowing On another subject Mr de la Madrid who took office last Wednesday said he believed that an intensive program of family education would gradually bring the population problem under control The rate of growth slowed from 35 percent in the 1960s to 25 percent by the end of the 1970s The object of his policies he said is to reduce the growth rate to 1 percent by the end of the century Even so the outlook is for a Mexican population of well over 100 million by then President de la Madrid asked whether he approved of Pope John Paul IIs opposition to abortion replied that there was a firm separation of church and state in Mexico and that as President he would rather not touch on subjects that were a matter exclusively for family decisions On Cuba the new President said his Government believed in the principles of selfdetermination and nonintervention This is not a romantic attitude he insisted Cuba is not interfering in Mexicos political affairs and has the right to determine its own political destiny he declared He deplored what he said was the excessive expenditure of 800 billion a year by all nations on arms when there is so much poverty and hunger in the world He said he felt that the multinational corporations of the rich nations were interfering too much in the affairs of other countries but his attitude was that most of these things were beyond his control and that he had to concentrate on getting Mexicos affairs in order New Standards of Morality This means he said getting control of the Mexican economy and establishing new standards of official morality at home The first thing he insisted is to set a standard of honest dealing beginning with his own Cabinet and particularly with himself Under his administration he noted officials will have to disclose their financial resources and business connections and avoid all conflicts between official duties and private interests He said that reports of official financial resources and business connections would be made available to the public I believe he said that in Mexico there is complete freedom of the press There is no legal impediment that would make it impossible for the press to ask as they wish in accordance with their own true conscience I dont know but I would venture to say that perhaps they themselves are a little cautious he said of his countrys press Perhaps they have difficulties of this kind too Mr de la Madrid was asked whether his stern criticism of corruption by past Mexican governments had made him reflect on his personal responsibility for the results he deplored since he had been in government for most of his adult life He replied that everyone who lived with a political system or society had a certain amount of responsibility But what I can say he added is that I never had any need to participate in any corrupt activity

NEW RULES SEEK TO SEPARATE ABORTION AND FAMILY CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/07/us/new-rules-seek-to-separate-abortion-and-family-clinics.html,The Department of Health and Human Services has prepared new rules for hospitals and clinics that would require abortion activities to be completely separated from all family planning services financed by the Federal Government The Public Health Service Act authorizes the Government to distribute money for family planning services but says that none of the money may be used for programs where abortion is a method of family planning Organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said they saw the rules as a form of harassment In their view abortion is not a method of family planning but a response to the lack or failure of it Under Title X of the Public Health Service Act the Government in 1981 distributed a total of 153 million to 5200 family planning clinics of which 74 performed abortions Of the 74 clinics 44 were situated in hospitals and 21 were affiliated with Planned Parenthood Nine of the 74 were in New York State five were in New Jersey and two were in Connecticut No Assistance to Women The new guidelines say that family planning and abortion clinics may not share office space personnel publications stationery medical equipment or supplies The family planning program would have to have entrances and exits separate from the abortion clinic Under the rules family planning clinics could not provide any assistance to women seeking abortions Specifically a pregnant woman could not use the telephone in a family planning clinic to make an appointment for an abortion Department officials said that the guidelines to be published in the Federal Register were needed to clarify and enforce their policy Abortion activities must be separate and distinct from family planning activities Representative Henry A Waxman chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committees Subcommittee on Health and the Environment said that the Reagan Administration appeared to be conducting an organized attack on family planning programs Mr Waxman a California Democrat said the guidelines violate the clear intent of Congress Criteria for Grant Decisions Dr Robert Graham the head of the Federal Health Resources and Services Administration confirmed in an interview Sunday that he had approved the guidelines They are undergoing a final review by Dr Edward N Brandt Jr the Assistant Secretary for Health Dr Graham recommended that the Government issue guidelines rather than formal regulations so as to avoid the procedural requirements that often delay regulations Under the Administrative Procedure Act a Federal agency proposing regulations must solicit comments from the public and consider them before issuing final regulations The guidelines would not have the full force of law but the department says it could use them as criteria in deciding who should receive Federal grants The General Accounting Office a Congressional investigative agency checked on family planning clinics at the request of two Republican Senators Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Jeremiah A Denton Jr of Alabama It found no evidence that Title X funds had been used to pay for abortions or to advise clients to have abortions But it said that the Department of Health and Human Services needs to set forth clear guidance on the scope of abortion restrictions Loss of Access Cited Mr Waxman said the new guidelines go far beyond anything called for in the GAO report If Federal policy is to be changed he added it should be done through the legislative process not by administrative fiat Mr Waxman said the guidelines have their worst effect on hospitals that offer both family planning and abortion services The hospitals he said cannot build separate wings purchase separate equipment and print separate stationery to provide services which are in fact perfectly legal Dorothy Mann executive director of the Family Planning Council of Southeastern Pennsylvania observed that the hospital physicians who do family planning often also do abortion as part of the practice of medicine If the guidelines went into effect Mrs Mann said an enormous number of patients who now have access to family planning services would lose that access because hospitals would lose their grants The council in Philadelphia is receiving 2 million from the Federal Government this year and serves 90000 people most of whom are poor women

VIDEO CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/08/opinion/video-contraception.html,Provocative sexual innuendo dominates primetime television and prestigious magazines Films made to attract teenage audiences are blatantly erotic So too the lyrics of popular songs as well as the passionate plot lines of soap operas Of them all television is perhaps the most successful exploiter of sex Toothpaste ads promise a sexy smile Skintight jeans promise popularity Automobile manufacturers hint at suggestive relationships with ones car Diet sodas make the pitch for sensuous bodies while sensuous bodies are sirens for faraway places With all this sexual provocation how does the television industry justify the hypocricy of blacking out advertising for contraceptives It cannot be the personal nature of the product  feminine hygiene products and pregnancy test kits blend into primetime programming without comment Televisions focus on sex to build audiences and sell goods grows out of our relatively recent openness about sex No one wants to return to the hypocritical pseudomorality of the Victorian age nor do most people believe that television should be censored as some have proposed What we do need to recognize however is that hazardous premature pregnancy among teenagers is an inevitable byproduct when our sexuality is exploited by the sales pitch The television industry shortsightedly declines to commit money or time to address these unintended consequences of its advertising While no one puts all the blame on televisions doorstep it must share some responsibility for the tragic pregnancy statistics for teenagers In New York State almost 25000 girls under 18 get pregnant every year resulting in just under 10000 births and almost 15000 abortions In 1977 New York Telephones Yellow Pages was similarly shortsighted about teenage pregnancy Though display ads for astrologers massage parlors and sex therapists were allowed an ad for Planned Parenthood of New York City listing reproductive health care was to be denied publication As with television today New York Telephone did not recognize the right of consumers to know about birth control Fortunately the phone company relented in the end That same year the United States Supreme Court in Carey v Population Services International struck down laws prohibiting the advertising and display of contraceptives In that decision the court acknowledged that contraceptive advertisements were not likely to encourage teenage sexual activity In fact tasteful television ads for contraceptives would provide a sober contrast to the overt suggestiveness of advertisements for designer jeans In 1982 the National Association of Broadcasters dropped all codes prohibiting birth control advertisements The associations members include the three major television networks and over 4000 radio stations These broadcasters are now free to set their own policy but they continue to ban contracptive advertising judging it too controversial In a Planned Parenthood of New York City survey 43 percent of the citys teenage girls said they were sexually active 25 percent by age 15 But only 9 percent used contraception every time they had sex and 12 percent never used it at all It was not surprising to find in the same survey that television scored a zero as a source of information about contraception The best protection against sexual exploitation and unwanted pregnancy is education Much of that must come from families sex education courses and the community However television is a powerful communicator of information and creator of attitudes which is why advertisers use it so extensively Given the fact of sexual activity by teenagers the television industry must allot time for getting crucial messages across Teenagers must learn the risks attached to sex be helped to avoid exploitation and learn they can say no Most importantly if they are sexually active they need to know how to avoid pregnancy If the 1980s are to be the decade of deregulation the most recent decision of the Justice Department to drop restrictions on television commercials is an example then a good way for television to start constructive selfregulation is by recognizing its obligations to Americas youth
WHAT GENDER GAP?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/opinion/what-gender-gap.html,Differences between the sexes may seem out of fashion but one new distinction is enjoying a vogue Women are voting more often for Democrats than men pollsters say Surveys probing the touted gender gap have suggested that rough Republicans ought to beware for women are especially sensitive on the subjects of war and social justice The pollster Louis Harris has gone so far as to claim that such distinctive feminine political sentiment  initially noted in 1980 when women supported Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter by only 47 to 45 percent according to New York TimesCBS News exit polls while men endorsed him by 55 to 36 percent  is a new political force in this country But in the light of last months election returns the gender gap looks less like a striking electoral phenomenon and more like a pollsters product To judge from the way women actually voted they do not compose a voting bloc with especially compassionate clout To be sure last months exit polls showed women supporting Democrats more decisively than men did But depending upon which of the three television networks surveys you trust the gender gap ranged between three and six percentage points  hardly a portent of lasting political realignment Even when women favored a Democratic candidate their votes rarely determined the outcome Indeed Republicans Paul Trible the Virginia senatorial candidate and Lowell Weicker incumbent Senator from Connecticut won despite strong female support for their opponents But such ambiguous electoral evidence does little to diminish concern about the gender gap  even at the highest level of government A recent White House report warns that though only one winner Mario Cuomo can be attributed to the gender gap at the statewide level continued growth of the gender gap in its current form could cause serious trouble for Republicans in 1984 Rather than broadly generalizing about the gender gap however Republicans and Democrats alike should consider more significant demographic distinctions among women themselves In the 1980 Presidential election for example New York TimesCBS News polls found that bluecollar women endorsed Mr Carter over Mr Reagan 51 to 43 percent whereas professional women supported Mr Reagan in similar proportions This time the same pollsters found that women in twoadult households inclined to the Democrats by a narrow 49 to 47 percent just like similarly situated men single women by contrast favored Democrats more decisively 64 to 33 percent compared to single mens Democratic preference of 58 to 38 percent If the gender gap figures themselves seem nebulous the facile speculations about their significance have been slippery as well According to Kathleen A Francovic director of surveys for CBS News it was the war and peace issue that seemed to separate the sexes in 1980 with women predictably perched on the dovish side By the spring and summer of this year however Miss Francovic found that the difference between the sexes views on foreign policy had narrowed to almost nothing Both slightly favored getting tough with the Soviet Union As for womens issues the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion in particular polls surprisingly have never shown any significant disparity between the sexes stands That leaves the socalled compassion issues  government assistance programs for those in need  frequently assumed to be feminine favorites Not only are women often credited with softer hearts toward sufferers they are also sometimes suspected of having softer heads when it comes to the complexities and repercussions of Federal spending One unnamed senior Presidential adviser was reported last year in the press to have said that women oppose Reaganomics because they dont understand interest rates as well as men Unromantic though it sounds however womens views seem to reflect mostly selfinterest The fact is that budget cuts in social programs are likely to affect women more than men The Census Bureau reported that 30 percent of all families headed by women receive food stamps and that 33 percent get Medicaid Elderly women constitute the majority of Social Security recipients And since women rarely have seniority in the labor market they are often the first laid off If the gender gap fails to confirm any stereotypes of womens superior sensitivity the figures do seem to point to the reality of their material inferiority The Administrations woman problem is in fact part of its familiar economic problems which arent likely to be solved by flirting with special appeals to the fair sex but by improving the overall performance of a fairer economy  Ann Hulbert is associate literary editor of The New Republic

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/us/briefing-089050.html,New Order of Convention W hen the new Washington Convention Center opens today the capital will join a small select company of American political power centers those cities lucky or benighted enough to claim facilities adequate for a Presidential nominating convention On the current cycle that could mean a Democratic nominating convention because President Reagan let it be known several months ago that he favored Dallas for his renominationretirement site and Republican heads have been nodding obediently ever since The pristine Washington hall can seat 12000 people the Democrats need space for 3800 delegates 2500 alternates several battalions of VIP spectators and some of the public Party officials believe the Washington area will be able to provide the necessary 20000 firstclass hotel rooms including 2000 suites Believe it or not convention site decision time is almost upon us The Democrats are sending out invitations for bids within the next week with replies due by midJanuary The site committee will cut the field to four finalists in early February test each of them with an inspection tour and pick the winner in April or May The critical question may be whether senators and representatives who are expected to attend the convention in increased numbers in 1984 are really ready for an extra week in Washington in midsummer Toward a Quincentennial I n the New World of the Western Hemisphere we havent had many opportunities yet for quincentennials so its not surprising that organizers are already gearing up nearly 10 years in advance for the 500th anniversary of Columbuss discovery of America in 1492 Today in the Capitol the American Quincentennial Organizing Committee will hold its first planning session for the proposed yearlong hemispherewide observance Among its members are such Hispanic leaders as Alejandro Orfila Secretary General of the Organization of American States and Representatives E Kika de la Garza of Texas Manuel Lujan Jr of New Mexico and Edward R Roybal of California Salutes for a Special Vote T his afternoon a group of female constituents are scheduled to make a special presentation to Senator SI Hayakawa of California Dressed in red white and blue outfits they are to salute him with a medley of songs and give him a freshly baked apple pie all this in recognition of his vote to kill an antiabortion proposal last September The visitors represent the California ProChoice Coalition and they will be illustrating their slogan Reproductive choice is as American as apple pie Next week they are to express similar gratitude to another Californian Senator Alan Cranston and to three leaders of the debate against the amendment Senators Bob Packwood of Oregon Max Baucus of Montana and Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut The amendment designed to ban abortion was defeated by a single vote The salutes represent an extension of the coalitions annual custom of serving apple pie to the California Legislature on Jan 22 the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized all but endofterm abortions Reading Tobacco Leaves F rom time to time it is possible to watch a Senate campaign unfolding in Washington two years and more before the election This has been true this year with Senator Jesse Helms the outspoken North Carolina Republican His term does not expire until 1984 but his prospective opponent Gov James B Hunt Jr already has the Democrats in motion and the Helms staff countering In last falls Congressional campaign North Carolina Democrats blasted the Reagan Administration tax bill that doubled to 16 cents a pack the Federal tax on cigarettes accusing Senator Helms of failing to protect state interests The tax increase was about as infamous a proposal as could be conceived in tobacco country and the Democrats accordingly picked up two House seats in the state Retaliating on this issue Senator Helms announced last week that he and his Republican colleague Senator John P East had persuaded the Department of Agriculture to rescind a twoweekold ruling that eliminated price supports on one class of tobacco The Federal courts had blocked the ruling in two other tobacco states and the Senator said he had been determined to put North Carolina growers on equal footing Phil Gailey Warren Weaver Jr
THE CLOUT OF THE 'NEW' BOB DOLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/magazine/the-clout-of-the-new-bob-dole.html,When I first got to know Bob Dole says George McGovern he was tough and mean That was back in the early 1970s when Senator Robert J Dole was a most acerbic Republican Party chairman and Senator McGovern was a most liberal Democratic candidate for President Today the two men count each other as friends He has changed says McGovern  not only on the personal and psychological levels he adds but in his approach to Government policy The transformation of Bob Dole suggested by this unlikely friendship  the onetime political gunslinger turned into a defender of the poor the hardline conservative turned toward mainstream Republicanism  has taken on special significance of late For the Senator from Kansas has become one of the most powerful and effective politicians in Washington His political means and ends are shaping the key legislation of the day Earlier this year as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee he almost singlehandedly engineered a huge tax increase in the face of a recalcitrant President and Congress  and managed to sell it as a reform measure aimed at collecting money from tax cheats and from littletaxed businesses In the months ahead with a Federal budget deficit that could approach 200 billion the 59yearold Senator and his committee will be chief among those to determine whose ox will be gored if Congress decides to further raise taxes or cut spending Next month he and his committee will be holding hearings on two of the hottest issues before Congress They will have to find answers to Social Securitys financing problems  cutting benefits increasing taxes or both And they will seek to balance domestic needs against the principles of free trade as a world in recession scrambles for international business Doles post usually receives little public notice even though the committees purview includes programs that will spend 435 billion in this fiscal year and every detail of the tax code from levies on gasoline and liquor to corporate depreciation allowances to personal tax deductions Tax action is traditionally in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives where revenue measures normally originate But with the House held by the Democrats it has fallen to the Republicancontrolled Senate to confront the practical consequences of the Presidents pledge to get the Government off our backs And Bob Dole dominates the revenue machinery of the Senate More than Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader  more than anyone except perhaps the President himself Dole has initiated manipulated and controlled the measures that constitute the fiscal posture of the United States Government Indeed Doles performance in the job coupled with the changes in his personal and political style have made him one of a handful of Republican members of Congress who can alter the direction of Administration policy All of which has proven to be something of a doubleedged sword for Senator Dole who has Presidential ambitions he does not bother to hide On the one hand the role of tax raiser and budget cutter is not calculated to increase a candidates political support On the other hand his responsibilities and visibility have been much enhanced Senator Dole spent the month of October on a brutal schedule of appearances in 21 states campaigning for Republican candidates But the election results spell trouble for the Finance Committee chairman On Social Security particularly he faces the prospect of writing legislation next year even less popular than the tax increases and budget cuts of 1982 and there will be fewer Republicans in Congress to give him a helping hand Bob Doles political roots are never far below the surface and they are Populist roots His recent attacks for example on pathologists who make a killing on Medicare or lawyers and doctors who manipulate tax returns to provide themselves opulent retirement plans followed rapidly by his pleadings for the guy whos struggling to get along on food stamps are echoes of the Populist revolt that swept the Kansas plains nearly a century ago During the depression of the 1890s the state produced the likes of Sockless Jerry Simpson who spent three terms in Congress as an implacable foe of Wall Street And even after Populism faded men like Alfred M Landon Republican Presidential nominee in 1936 could be heard plugging for the little fellow in the grip of the interests Dole grew up in Russell a town of 5500 people surrounded by endless plains of wheat and it was a shouldertothewheel nofrills childhood for Bob his brother and two sisters His father Doran who died in 1975 managed a grain elevator his mother Bina who is now 79 sold sewing machines Bob and his brother worked at odd jobs washing cars digging pipe trenches At high school Bob Dole was captain of the basketball team and he went on to premedical studies at the University of Kansas He quit in 1943 to enter the Army where he rose to the rank of captain Twice wounded and twice decorated in World War II he was put out of action when he led an infantry charge on a German machinegun nest in Italy His right shoulder was shattered and he lost a kidney doctors at first held little hope for his survival then predicted he would never walk again Dole spent 39 months hospitalized His friends in Russell raised funds for special operations and he stubbornly refused to accept physical dependency He squeezed rubber balls constantly to strengthen his crippled hands and exercised with homebuilt gadgets to build up weakened legs and nearly paralyzed arms Dole married Phyllis Holden a physical therapist soon after he was discharged from the hospital in 1948 He never had planned to get married she told an interviewer in 1976 He felt so lacking She also observed that much of what Dole had achieved since the war had been an effort to prove that he could do it in spite of his handicap His education for example Unable to take lecture notes because his right hand was permanently crippled Dole recorded the lectures and taught himself to write with his left hand enabling him to transcribe them He earned both a bachelors and a law degree from Washburn University in Topeka Kan At the age of 27 while still in law school Dole was elected to the Kansas Legislature Two years later in 1952 he was elected to the first of four terms as Russell County Attorney and then in 1960 he ran successfully for a seat in the House of Representatives As a campaigner Dole cut a handsome figure  and he still does He stands 6 feet 1 12 inches and weighs 175 pounds His dark eyes are intense yet they often convey the spirit of a boy who has done something mischievous During his eight years in the House Dole and most of his Republican colleagues found themselves in constant and fruitless opposition to the spending programs advocated by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson Dole voted against the first of the big antipoverty programs in 1964 and against aid to impoverished Appalachia subsidies for urban masstransportation projects and Medicare Americans for Democratic Action gave him a zero approval rating four times during his stay in the House His record on civil rights was mixed For example he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but against the 1966 bill to ban discrimination in the sale or rental of housing It was after Doles election to the Senate in 1968 that he began to attract national notice particularly as a staunch defender of Richard M Nixon He backed his Presidents policies on Vietnam all the way and when the Senate plunged into seven weeks of debate over an amendment to cut off money for military activities in Cambodia Dole led the opposition winning admiration for his clever tactics if not always for his rhetoric Doles devotion to my President as he so often identified him was epitomized by his tough defense of the two Nixon nominees to the Supreme Court who failed to pass muster in the Senate Judges Clement F Haynsworth Jr and G Harrold Carswell He flayed Democrats who were concerned about Carswells record on racial issues Carswell had made a speech supporting white supremacy participated in the conversion of a municipal golf course to private ownership to avoid desegregation and was reported to have behaved with hostility toward civilrights workers and lawyers who appeared in his courtroom In a memorable moment just before the final vote on Carswell confronted by uncertainty within his own partys ranks Dole strode up and down the center aisle pointing at individual Senators and proclaiming I would remind my Republican friends  that Richard Nixon was elected President in November 1968 and that with that election came the right and duty to nominate Justices of the Supreme Court He then delivered a thinly veiled threat of political retribution He said he hoped the President would leave the seat vacant if Carswell was rejected and take the case to the American people It may be easier he said to change the Senate than the United States Supreme Court In reward for this kind of loyalty Nixon had Bob Dole installed as Republican national chairman in January 1971 he served in the post for two years It was during this period that Doles attacks on George McGovern for his antiwar stand escalated markedly as McGovern sought and won the Democratic nomination for the Presidency McGovern recalls Doles labels very well advocate of centralized power leftleaning big spender tool of organized labor McGovern added There was the strong implication that those of us who opposed Nixons war policies were giving aid and comfort to the enemy The Nixon campaign was controlled by the White House and operated by the Committee to Reelect the President with Dole and the Republican National Committee operating on the fringes He was not privy to Watergate and he chose not to believe the allegations of illegality and White House coverups actually drafting a resolution that sought to stop the Senate investigation of the White House Eventually though Dole faced the music George McGovern dates some of the changes in Dole to that period  a first step as he puts it Says Dole I was very disillusioned with the White House the arrogant people who worked there We went through purgatory for a while as a party That combined with a very close race for the Senate in 1974 made me think Id better take a look at where I was going here was room for improvement During his first four years in the Senate Bob Dole won few popularity contests with his colleagues or with his staff Turnover was high among his aides Those who knew him spoke of his meanness his sarcastic putdowns of other people Some of these attributes surfaced dramatically in his 1974 campaign for reelection to the Senate a rough battle against a twoterm House Democrat William R Roy a doctorlawyer from Topeka Roy built up a comfortable lead by emphasizing Doles connections with Nixon and Nixons connections with Watergate Dole exploited his opponents admission that he had performed a number of abortions over the years Dole called Roy an abortionist who favored abortion on demand though Roy insisted he viewed the operation as morally repugnant and only occasionally necessary to safeguard the womans health Dole won reelection by a 2 percent margin Less than two years later Dole was on the stump againthis time as Gerald Fords running mate He traveled 65000 miles through 44 states Im a oneman road show he joked President Ford just winds me up and says go  His campaign style though was his own He made much of the feelings of lust to which Jimmy Carter had admitted in an interview for Playboy magazine leaving audiences with the impression that Carter favored lewd behavior Then Dole went on to blame the Democrats for all the American wars of the 20th century In a debate with Senator Walter F Mondale his counterpart on the Democratic ticket Dole commented I figured up the other day if we added all the killed and wounded in all Democrat wars in this century it would be about 16 million Americans enough to fill the city of Detroit The remark haunted him for the rest of the campaign and added to his reputation as an unscrupulous partisan The Republicans lost the election by a whisker It was a sobering experience for Dole VicePresidential candidates are chosen with the idea that they will pull voters toward the national ticket but electionday polls suggested that Dole might actually have cost Ford votes maybe even enough to deny him election Friends of Ford said as much to reporters As the 1970s progressed evidence of change appeared in Senator Dole As early as 1974 for example he voted against the Republican Administrations plan to slash the antipoverty program  a program he had opposed at the time of its inception 10 years earlier That turnaround may have reflected a new awareness of poverty gained through service on the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs of which McGovern was chairman He started as a doubter both of McGovern and of the committee Dole recalls I may have thought McGovern was going too far in publicizing hunger in America looking down the road at some Presidential contest As Dole concentrated more on the committees work after the 1972 election he became impressed with the case that had been built for Federal foodassistance programs Together McGovern and Dole pushed the Government deeper and deeper into the nutrition business There was legislation nearly every year in the 1970s  fights over expanding food stamps or establishing new programs of school breakfasts and nutrition supplements for pregnant women and infants The budget of the Food and Nutrition Service of the Agriculture Department which administers the feeding programs has now grown to 15 billion and the agency estimates that some 38 million people receive nutrition subsidies Ive said publicly and much to the disgust of some of my conservative friends that McGovern did a good job in that area Dole says today The statement suggests another lesson McGovern taught him  how to work with a Democrat of distinctly different philosophical outlook Dole and McGovern were a team not only on nutrition issues but also on other issues in the Agriculture Committee becoming in the last half of the 1970s the dominant influence on expensive support programs for Middle Western corn and wheat crops The new Bob Dole continued to surprise In 1978 he voted with the Democrats to give people earning from 10000 to 30000 larger tax cuts a move opposed by the majority of his party That same year he provided the key vote needed to gain Senate approval of a proposed constitutional amendment that would give the District of Columbia voting representation in the House and Senate  once again a move many Republicans opposed Dole also won favor among liberals by proposing a program of catastrophic health insurance to provide families with Government protection against financial ruin because of extended expensive illness In early 1978 Dole was the featured speaker at an Atlanta meeting of people interested in recruiting more black candidates to run under the GOP banner Applauding the effort he said that Republicans need to make the extra effort to erase the lingering image of our party as the cadre of the elite the wealthy the insensitive  Our job now is to demonstrate our concern to blacks and others who doubt our sincerity Doles friends and admirers when asked to explain the change in him often point to his personal life  specifically to his marriage in 1975 to Elizabeth Hanford a lawyer 13 years his junior who was serving as a Republican member of the Federal Trade Commission He obtained a divorce from Phyllis Dole in 1972 after 24 years of marriage and one daughter Elizabeth Dole holds a Phi Beta Kappa key from Duke University and a law degree and masters in education from Harvard She is a warm and open person who has helped chisel some of the rough edges from Doles personality Some say she is politically more liberal than her husband and that this is reflected in his increasing advocacy of measures to protect the disadvantaged and in his exhortations to the Republican Party to broaden its base of support Mrs Dole herself denies such influence The most she will allow is that her views and those of her husband are mostly compatible An Assistant to the President for Public Liaison she is a Washington power in her own right But she is a Reagan operative and Dole is determinedly his own man Only occasionally do they work in tandem as when the President came around on Doles tax measure this year  Elizabeth Dole helped line up business support for the legislation Doles physical handicap is another significant factor in his makeup McGovern remembers seeing Dole fall in the Senate subway one day his crippled right arm unable to break the impact The pain was obvious and said McGovern it was a pitiful sight he really was handicapped Dole is virtually unable to use his right hand or arm he must allow himself one hour to dress each morning His concern for others who are handicapped is manifest He has employed signlanguage interpreters to enable deaf people to understand his speeches He gave almost half of the 66850 he earned in speaking fees last year to charities for crippled children the blind the retarded and other handicapped people He has used his influence in Congress to secure tax breaks and other benefits for the handicapped Says McGovern The handicapped the children and the elderly he puts them all in the same category The poor and malnourished too Anyone who has some special situation Dole cannot resist Elizabeth Dole adds I see in him concern and sensitivity for people who have suffered adversity no matter what the source of their problems As for the Senator himself though he insists he is still a budget cutter he allows that now that we Republicans have some responsibility we have to be very careful before we just go along with people taking off after programs and saying there is no need for them It was not long after his 1976 debacle that Bob Dole started building toward a run for the Presidency in 1980 and he looked about for ways to gain some credentials as a foreignpolicy expert The defeat of Senator James L Buckley of New York opened a Republican spot on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe the United States body that supervises compliance with the Helsinki accords on human rights Dole sought the vacancy and quickly became one of the most active and conscientious members of the commission he now serves as its cochairman Dole also took a leading role in opposing the Panama Canal treaties that were before the Senate for ratification in 1978 He advocated two amendments to the treaties one assuring American defense rights after the year 2000 the other guaranteeing priority passage for American ships in time of war On May 14 1979 Bob Dole announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination But it was not a wellorganized effort and Doles public recognition was not in the same league with that of Reagan and Bush Whats more as the new ranking minority member of the Finance Committee he had to be on hand for the Senates prolonged consideration of legislation to tax windfall profits of oil companies leaving him little time to chase the frontrunners He never attracted much of a following and withdrew after receiving an embarrassing 608 votes in the New Hampshire primary Yet Election Day 1980 had its consolations for Dole He easily won a third term in the Senate and enough other Republicans were elected to give the GOP control of the Senate for the first time in 26 years He would be chairman of the Finance Committee and he knew immediately as he said later that this would mean that he could in effect direct what may happen in tax policy Two weeks after the election he told an interviewer It seems to me that weve got an opportunity here and thats what it is an opportunity Its not a lifetime lease If we can demonstrate in the next couple of years that were not turning our backs on the poor and still adopt some changes that reduce the growth of Federal spending and get inflation down then were going to be a force to be reckoned with But Dole was worried about the Reagan economic program fearing that huge tax cuts unmatched by spending reductions would create unmanageable budget deficits He kept his doubts muffled and watched uneasily as the Administration and House Democrats engaged in a bidding match that added billions of dollars in tax reductions Finally Dole himself entered the lists with a measure to keep taxpayers from being pushed into higher brackets by inflation It was a major piece of tax reform but it was likely to cost the Federal Government billions of dollars in tax revenues over the next decade President Reagan achieved wonders with Congress in 1981 but Dole saw storm warnings ahead The year of testing he predicted would be 1982 Thats when things are going to get tough Discontent with the impact of Reaganomics  in Congress on Wall Street and elsewhere began to surface almost immediately after the 1981 tax bill was enacted But it wasnt until last February when the Administration unveiled its budget for fiscal 1983 that the pot really began to boil No one believed the Administrations claim that deficits could be kept just below the feared 100 billion mark For weeks negotiations between the White House and Congress stumbled along in search of some formula to cut spending and raise taxes that would be acceptable to the President Finally the Democratic leadership in the House tried to put through its own budget resolution When the House failed in its first attempt Bob Dole declared that he and his Finance Committee had no intention of standing by If the House doesnt act theres no reason we shouldnt he said Our responsibility since we are in the majority is to lead We cant wait for the House In fact Dole had not been waiting for the House the Senate the Administration or anyone else in advocating changes he thought were needed in the tax code In January he suggested a minimum tax to insure that companies pay at least 15 percent of profits  and he suggested that a similar tax should be applied to rich individuals as well In March he introduced legislation aimed at improving Federal tax collections by greatly increasing reporting requirements from companies paying out dividends capital gains and interest and by beefing up the Internal Revenue Services enforcement capabilities Then he announced during a speech in Wichita that he wanted to modify or repeal the socalled leasing rule which allows companies to sell tax breaks they cant use to other companies He said the change would be retroactive to the date of the speech  a piece of news that stopped many a leasing negotiation dead in its tracks Among the constituencies adversely affected by the proposals offered by Dole and the young lawyers on the staff of his Finance Committee were the insurance industry large defense contractors and professionals who incorporate themselves in order to establish fulsome retirement incomes Even pathologists were threatened as Dole sought to trim the huge fees they were billing to Medicare A pathologist in Kansas offered to give me a free autopsy the Senator said The trouble is he wants to do it now The Dole approach guaranteed that he would have to fight many battles to reach his goal of increasing Federal receipts by almost 100 billion over the next three years and many doubted that he could succeed with his package of revenueraising cats and dogs Said Representative Barber B Conable Jr Republican of New York Its hard to shepherd such a herd over all the obstacles I didnt think he could do it For one thing Doles plans for new and larger taxes clearly held little appeal for the President They particularly angered two groups of Reagan supporters supplyside theorists and corporate managers The supplyside theorists those who insisted that the previous years tax cuts would eventually bring the economy to good health opposed Dole on principle Corporate leaders as represented by their trade associations and lobbyists came running to protest Doles proposals to increase business taxes But the Washington lobbyists who get paid upward of 200 an hour for providing access to the likes of Bob Dole and other key tax policymakers found themselves shut out He ridiculed them as the truly greedy a play on the Presidents pledge not to hurt the truly needy and he went so far as to criticize them by name When Charls E Walker a former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury suggested postponing individual incometax reductions to trim the deficit Dole took him to task The Charlie Walkers of this world say Dont worry about the individuals defer their tax cuts and take care of business  Of course Dole was playing to a larger audience trying to convince the public that he and the Republican Party stood for equitable tax and spending programs Yet if Dole was to succeed he had to cope with the closein political realities of the situation For one thing he could not afford to alienate Ronald Reagan and in fact Dole eventually succeeded in convincing the President to join forces For another Dole would have to tread carefully within the 20person Finance Committee particularly with those 10 members who were running for reelection It wasnt easy At one point early in July a majority of the committee voted against one of the linchpins of Doles measure  a requirement that banks and companies withhold taxes when paying out interest and dividends Dole recessed the panel immediately and called a caucus of the Republicans He was angry that two of the Republicans had taken him by surprise by voting against withholding which he hoped would produce more than 10 billion in revenues But Dole controlled his anger and listened as Senator John H Chafee of Rhode Island who had indicated his opposition weeks before and thus was not a Dole target set forth his arguments When Chafee concluded by announcing that thousands of campaign brochures advertising his views on withholding had been printed Dole interrupted Have you distributed any yet he asked with a grin Well pay to have them reprinted The line got a laugh and broke the tension Before the caucus was over Dole had shepherded the two straying Republican votes back into the fold Chafee analyzes Doles success as chairman in these terms First he goes out of his way to keep his fellow committee members informed about what is going on in frequent small meetings in his office and in a room off the Senate floor Second although he knew what he wanted in the tax bill he made sure that all options were laid out so no one would feel he was running a steamroller operation Doles staff prepared a list of 34 possible revenueraising cats and dogs and carefully gathered the views of the Finance Committee Republicans on all of them Dole paid close attention to the particular interests of committee members so that he could trade small favors in return for votes on larger tax increases He also was willing to compromise when faced by substantial opposition Senator David F Durenberger Republican of Minnesota for example at one point lined up a dozen committee supporters for a proposal to make only minor changes in the taxleasing provisions of the 1981 tax law while Dole was still pushing for their total repeal Dole agreed to soften his stand on leasing and Durenberger one of the two Republicans who unexpectedly had opposed Dole on the withholding issue was persuaded to change his mind Chafee also says that Dole keeps deep in his hip pocket something that will win the cause for him when it seems to be going the other way An example that astonished other senators  as smooth a legislative operation as any Ive seen says Chafee came in the early hours of the morning of July 23 as the Senate was blearily concluding its marathon final session on the tax legislation Dole had included in the Finance Committee bill a provision designed to improve the collection of taxes on the tips received by waiters and waitresses The Internal Revenue Service estimates that only 16 percent of tip income is reported So the Finance Committee voted to require restaurant owners to estimate for the IRS a portion of the tip income of its employees The national association representing restaurant owners upset over the added bookkeeping the measure would require lobbied strongly against the provision and its view prevailed on the Senate floor Doles bill was stripped of more than 2 billion in anticipated revenues While lobbyists for the restaurant owners slept securely that July morning Dole was at work Under the rules of the Senate he could not offer an amendment that had not been considered by the Finance Committee but  to the astonishment of Senate veterans  he did obtain a ruling from the parliamentarian that the committee itself could advance an amendment Dole quickly polled committee members on a proposal to curtail the deductibility of business entertainment a variation of the Democrats threemartinilunch reform last seen in the Carter Administration and it passed the Senate easily If you cant take the income out of the restaurants says Dole sardonically then you can just take the customers out of them In the final version of the tax bill the tipreporting requirement he had sought to begin with was restored and the threemartinilunch provision was dropped Early in August Dole persuaded Reagan to take an active role in pushing the tax measure through the House and by Aug 19 it had been approved by both houses and sent to the President Dole believes that its bow in the direction of controlling deficits contributed to the stockmarket boom in early fall and to falling interest rates He also claims it accomplished the political purpose he sought to cope with the Democrats charge that the Republican program was unfair He claimed  optimistically as it turned out  that the Democratic claim has been erased since the Presidents strong support of the tax bill The comment was vintage Dole demonstrating the style that enabled him to engineer the huge tax increase despite President Reagans distaste for taxes The President never had to concede that the Administration had changed directions on tax policy Dole named the bill the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and he sold it to Mr Reagan as a measure to close tax loopholes rather than as a tax increase What gave the approach special elan was that to a degree it was true In the Senate for example Ted Kennedy announced that he would vote for the conference report on the bill because it contained many tax reforms he had advocated for years He and eight other Democrats helped provide the fivevote margin by which the bill passed Doles ability to find compromise positions with his President and with the Democratic opposition is pointed to by his admirers as an important element of the new Dole He walked that tightrope for example when the Finance Committee dealt with Administration proposals for cuts in Medicare Medicaid and welfare programs He managed to scale back those trims especially in the health area where he has become one of the Senates most knowledgeable members Regarding Medicaid for example the Administration was promoting the idea that the lowincome beneficiaries of the program should be required to make a small payment each time they visited a doctor on the theory that this would discourage unnecessary visits and cut costs But the Childrens Defense Fund with Doles help battled successfully to exempt pregnant women and children arguing that preventive health care was particularly important for them As for Medicaid Dole accepted just over 2 billion of the Administrations proposed 8 billion in reduced outlays over the next three years When the Voting Rights Act was up for extension the Justice Department wanted a bill that would require that intent to discriminate must be proved as a condition of Federal intervention in votingrights cases Dole who is a power on the generally conservative Senate Judiciary Committee disagreed and he managed to collect enough votes to get his version of the measure out of committee He conceived his position as a compromise that the Administration could accept and the White House ended up doing just that Once he makes a commitment he makes a very strong personal effort says Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights All of which is not to say that the Bob Dole of the 1980s bears no resemblance to the 70s version When the Senator himself is asked he likes to quote a friend the New York pollster Tully Plesser Dole hasnt changed Hes been noticed Then Dole goes on Was it marriage to Elizabeth Hanford was it the 1976 election was it becoming chairman of the Finance Committee or just getting older I mean I dont know that Ive changed all that much Maybe a kind of maturing process But I am still basically conservative That held true on the agenda of social issues that reached the Senate floor late in the 1982 session He voted for prayer in the schools against busing to achieve school integration and against abortion He also approved changes in welfare that critics say have discouraged recipients from looking for work Yet the predictable unbending conservatism of Doles past is no longer uppermost At the least he has become more pragmatic and conciliatory and more concerned with the needs of the nations disadvantaged The onceclear image of the man has become blurred When the 98th Congress convenes next month there is no doubt that Bob Dole will have another opportunity to make his mark As Chafee says the Finance Committee will again be the principal act in the circus Social Security and international trade are on the committees agenda for January Action on proposals for further trims in domestic spending and possibly for a new round of tax increases could come later As was true of the tax bill this year none of these issues offers an easy chance to gain political credit Social Security for example Benefit checks for more than 30 million retirees will be delayed beginning next July unless Congress passes legislation allowing the oldage trust fund to continue borrowing from sister funds And such an extension would simply buy time for a few months doing nothing to produce the 150 billion to 200 billion the system needs to remain solvent in the 1980s In August flush with his taxbill success Dole urged President Reagan to call a special postelection session of Congress devoted to solving the retirement systems financing problems Dole felt that a solution devised by the Finance Committee and approved by Congress in 1982 would make for another gaudy feather in his cap and he thought that result was possible if the November elections produced a Democratic gain of only about 15 seats in the House But the Democrats won 26 new seats and chances evaporated that the House Democratic leadership would agree to treat Social Security in the lameduck session The Democrats use of the Social Security issue during the election  many accused their Republican opponents of backing plans to cut benefits  also killed any chance that Dole could somehow forge a quick bipartisan consensus on the issue It was a very very bitter experience for many of us says Senator Chafee who was barely reelected in Rhode Island Two days after the election Dole showed that he had not lost his knack for partisan battle He called a press conference to denounce the Democrats use of the Social Security issue and to indicate that Republicans should not be in a hurry to suggest ways of making up Social Securitys revenue shortfall He explained Once the American people understand the Democrats dont have any ideas that they dont want to do anything then we can come in and save the system in a responsible way On Jan 25 another important set of hearings are scheduled to begin in the Finance Committee  a postmortem on the meeting of 88 countries trade ministers that concluded in Geneva on Nov 29 Held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the meeting did not produce everything the United States delegation had hoped for the European governments for example refused to stop subsidizing their agricultural exports Dole was in Geneva for some of the ministers meetings and his assessment of the results will be important in determining how Congress will react to the fact that other nations are continuing to enact legislation to protect their domestic industries There are proposals for example backed by American labor to require that all cars sold in the United States be manufactured with a specified percentage of domestically produced parts As Dole perceives it his committee will be spending its time trying to figure some way to ward off protectionism The hearings will give him a different stage on which to perform and Dole seems more interested in the trade issue than in more action on budget cutting and tax increases In that he reflects a general lack of appetite in Congress for any further unpopular trims in programs or services or for another round of tax increases Meanwhile Dole continues to reflect on his chances of getting the top job in his profession and he is realistic about the obstacles in his path He would seek the 1984 Republican nomination he says only if Reagan does not but he believes the President should run and probably will run for reelection If he were to enter the fray he would have to attract much more of a national following than he has in past attempts for national office Some politicians see the Finance Committee as an unlikely base from which to accomplish that goal arguing that its job of cutting spending and raising taxes is not designed to win friends Senator Chafee among others disagees with that analysis The impressions Dole has made in his many appearances in the national media of late says Chafee will be remembered by the public much more than any specific legislation he might have sponsored Robert M Teeter a major GOP pollster says Dole is a hot property for television today for three reasons Hes in an important position hes candid and hes witty Dole says that he is at least kind of staying alive as a possible candidate but the likelihood for the near term is that he will stick to the Finance Committee It seems not a bad second choice
NEW HOPE FOR TREATING LEPROSY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/magazine/new-hope-for-treating-leprosy.html,Carol Levine is the editor of Hastings Center Report which deals with ethical issues in the life sciencesEvery three months James Rodriguez travels by subway ferry and bus from his home in Queens to Bayley Seton Hospital on Staten Island A burly suntanned man he looks vigorous and healthy The only signs of the disease he has had for 30 of his 49 years are the lesions on his hands which look like unhealed burns or abrasions Mr Rodriguez does not mind the twohour trip to the clinic It fills his time A former construction worker he is able to work with some limitations and would like to find a job But as soon as employers find out about his condition they find reasons not to hire him He does not mind talking about his disease but he avoids naming it Patients he explains call it the package Its medical name is Hansens disease but the world knows  and fears  it as leprosy The term leper is derived from the Greek lepra or scaly in time it was used to describe an outcast  in particular a moral outcast  an association which explains leprosy patients aversion to the word Few other diseases evoke such universal fear and revulsion The images many of ancient origin are powerful  the whiterobed outcast ringing a bell to announce his approach the faceless deformed leper holding out a begging bowl the community of exiles attended by martyrs like the 19thcentury priest Father Damien who was stricken with the disease while treating lepers on the Hawaian island of Molokai Yet Mr Rodriguez not his real name and the 4000 to 5000 other Hansens disease patients in America who are being treated pose no threat to their families communities or the public health As long as he remains in treatment  as he most likely will for the rest of his life  he will not transmit his disease to others Publichealth officials however are closely monitoring the rising number of new cases reported in this country More people are immigrating here from areas where the disease is widespread primarily Latin America and Asia Because the incubation period for the disease is so long  three to 10 years and even longer people who appear to be healthy when they arrive may actually be carrying the disease and can transmit it to others And because of the stigma they may ignore early symptoms like numbness and skin lesions that do not heal and avoid seeking treatment until the disease is advanced On Staten Island Dr William Levis who heads the Hansens disease clinic says that he regularly treats 300 patients from the New York metropolitan area To these numbers he is adding one or two new cases a week An estimated 100 other cases are being treated privately in the area In 1981 244 new cases were reported in the country as a whole 91 of them in California and most of the rest in Hawaii Texas Louisiana and New York o alert physicians many of whom have never seen a single case of leprosy the Journal of the American Medical Association recently published an article that included the most current medical information about the disease Worldwide leprosy is a health and social problem of staggering proportions There are an estimated 15 million people with the disease in the third world 80 percent of them untreated Bad as it is the situation could become even worse The World Health Organization WHO recently reported that the drug that has been the mainstay of treatment for the last 40 years is losing its effectiveness At the same time there are some hopeful signs The first human tests of a promising new vaccine are scheduled to begin early in 1983 the result of an international research effort coupling high technology and the homely armadillo one of the few animals in which scientists can grow leprosy bacteria The concern of American patients however is for the immediate future Historically they have been both the victims and the beneficiaries of governmental paternalism From the early 19th century until as recently as the 1960s state publichealth laws forced them into segregated hospitals and sometimes even prohibited them from voting or marrying These laws either have been repealed or are no longer enforced because scientists now question the value of isolation But the system of free and comprehensive medical care that accompanied the earlier repressive policies is also being cut back The closing last year of eight of the nine publichealth hospitals that had provided medical care for leprosy patients has left them fearful of the future Although new arrangements have been worked out for their medical care patients fear that the secret they guard so carefully may now be revealed Their bodies can be healed but leprosy patients carry the package for life I was 19 when I first got sick Mr Rodriguez recalls There were numb spots on my hands and later some discolored patches of skin that got red and inflamed My parents took me from doctor to doctor for a diagnosis I even spent 18 months in a tuberculosis sanitarium Finally they sent me to Mexico where I had been born A doctor there took one look at me and said I know whats wrong with you  Observed and described since biblical times leprosy remains a mysterious disease This much is known It is a chronic infection caused by a bacillus called Mycobacterium leprae The bacillus the first human bacterial pathogen ever to be identified was discovered in 1874 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard H Armauer Hansen  after whom the disease was named M leprae is in the same family as the organism that causes tuberculosis M leprae attacks the skin and the surrounding nerves as well as other sensitive organs such as the testes and eyes Patients usually do not die of leprosy and often live to old age After many years they do become vulnerable to secondary infections Leprosy occurs in several different forms and for this reason it has often been confused with other diseases Patients with tuberculoid leprosy may suffer severe but localized nerve damage the result of inflammation as their own immune systems mount a strong defense against the invading bacteria In these cases the disease burns out and usually does not recur Graham Greene used the metaphor of the burntout case in his novel of that name to describe a disillusioned architects attempt to find refuge in an African leprosarium Lepromatous leprosy is the most serious and the most contagious form Sufferers from it are unable to produce the strong immunological defense against M leprae developed by 90 percent to 95 percent of the population Once it is contracted the disease spreads unchecked without treatment Only about 5 percent of the population exposed to MLeprae says Dr Levis will be susceptible to the disease and of that 5 percent the majority appear to require prolonged intimate contact Despite the popular belief it is not possible he adds to contract leprosy simply by touching someone who has the disease Many of the deformities associated with leprosy result from the loss of feeling due to nerve damage in the hands and feet With no sensation ofLEPROSY JUMP Page 110 pain or pressure patients do not notice burns cuts or bruises or take care of the inevitable pressure sores Not being able to feel anything  thats the most terrible part of the disease as far as the physical aspects are concerned says one patient I cant tell if something is rough or smooth hot or cold Its like my hands are stuck on  not part of my body What is known then about leprosy is the organism that causes it and the course it takes in its destructive path But much more remains unknown including why most people are immune and some highly susceptible There is a theory that genetic factors play a role in determining susceptibility but no real evidence to support it Some patients susceptible to leprosy are also vulnerable to other diseases such as syphilis and tuberculosis but exactly how their immune systems differ from the rest of the population is not known Leprosy is prevalent in areas with poor sanitation poor nutrition and inadequate housing  common conditions in the third world  but why these factors alone or in combination should affect the spread of the disease is also unclear Probably only human beings transmit leprosy but how Another mystery There is some evidence that the bacillus can be spread through the air by nasal secretions but none to show that this is in fact the way the disease is communicated Prolonged intimate contact with an untreated patient creates a slightly higher risk of getting the disease but a large number of patients have had no history of contact The very long incubation period makes it extremely difficult to trace the origin Despite the lack of knowledge about leprosy on the part of physicians the disease has been treatable Since the 1940s sulfone drugs especially dapsone diaminodiphenylsulfone or DDS has been the most common form of therapy Dapsone is an effective safe drug and remarkably inexpensive besides A patient can be treated for a year at a cost of a few dollars Even so in a country like India which has millions of cases the bill for dapsone can run to 20 million a year Some patients are unable to take dapsone because of side effects They are generally treated with either rifampin or clofazimine 100 times more expensive than dapsone Many white patients are unwilling to take clofazimine because it darkens the skin Thalidomide  notorious for causing severe birth defects  is also used to treat inflammation that accompanies leprosy but only in men and in women past the age of reproduction But dapsone is beginning to lose the battle against leprosy The World Health Organizations Chemotherapy of Leprosy Program reported early this year that M leprae organisms isolated from untreated patients are resistant to dapsone in 18 percent of new patients in an area of South India and in 40 percent of those in Mali The WHO recommends a regimen of combined drugs for all new patients but warns Dapsone which has been the standard drug of control in leprosy may eventually be of little use even in combination with more expensive and less well tolerated drugs Enter the armadillo A nocturnal animal that has survived for 55 million years the armadillo looks like a miniature dinosaur The species that flourishes in the Gulf states has nine movable bands connecting leathery shields protecting its back and sides These ninebanded armadillos bedevil nighttime drivers by jumping as high as three feet  usually to their deaths  when startled by oncoming headlights The armadillo has a very low body temperature  between 31 degrees and 35 degrees centigrade compared with 37 degrees for humans and this proved to be the key to leprosy research Leprosy first attacks the cooler tissues of human beings  the skin primarily Until the late 1950s no animal had been experimentally infected with M leprae in the laboratory so that the organism could be studied The bacillus still cannot be cultured in a test tube Then Dr Charles Shepard of the United States Center for Disease Control in Atlanta successfully grew M leprae in the cool tissues in the footpads of mice He needed a larger animal however to continue the research Eleanor Storrs a researcher then at the GulfSouth Research Institute in New Iberia La suggested to Dr Shepard that the animals she was working with  armadillos  would be likely candidates In 1968 she began collaborating with Dr Waldemar F Kirchheimer of PAGE 111 the National Hansens Disease Center formerly the United States Public Health Service Hospital in Carville La They found that about 80 percent of the armadillos they infected with the bacillus contracted leprosy and in an especially virulent form The work of Dr Storrs now a professor of biology at the Florida Institute of Technology and Dr Kirchheimer on the tissues of laboratoryinfected armadillos made it possible for other scientists to begin developing a vaccine Several years later wild armadillos infected with leprosy were found in Texas and Louisiana It is not known what role if any this presumably naturally occurring disease may have in transmission to humans Recently mangabey monkeys have also been infected with leprosy and it will now be possible to study the disease in an animal closer to humans From his fourthfloor laboratory in the cancer research center at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx Barry Bloom directs the steering committee of the WHOs Immunology of Leprosy Program I was interested only in pure science says Dr Bloom until my wife and I took a trip to India in 1967 The human misery caused by leprosy there overwhelmed me I knew that science  especially immunology ought to be able to help Just a few years earlier in 1965 President Lyndon B Johnson and Prime Minister Eisaku Sato of Japan had signed an agreement to cooperate on medical research with primary emphasis on diseases of special concern to Asia including leprosy Since then the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has backed basic research on leprosy Some might question why the United States should be interested in leprosy since its so rare here Dr Bloom observes I think we have a basic humanitarian responsibility to work on diseases of the third world but there is plenty of relevance to our own problems as well If we can understand the mechanism of nerve damage this will help us understand diseases like multiple sclerosis The link to cancer research is equally strong Leprosy is a wonderful immunological model to study why cancer patients do not reject their tumors he points out The United States commitment to leprosy research combined with a WHO effort that began in the early 1970s has created an unusual chain of scientific cooperation that utilizes the expertise of several specialties and the technical capabilities of laboratories around the world Tissues harvested from laboratoryinfected armadillos in the southeastern United States are sent to London where the bacilli in the tissues are killed and purified by special techniques The material is then sent to Seattle Denver and Oslo Norway for analysis of the specific components In Atlanta and the Bronx the killed purified bacilli  now an experimental vaccine  are tested in guinea pigs and mice to make sure it creates an immunological reaction At the center in Carville the vaccine is injected into healthy armadillos So far about 75 percent of the armadillos immunized in this way have demonstrated an immune response that prevents infection The next step is to try the vaccine in humans In an effort to see how large a dose is necessary to produce an appropriate immune response without untoward side effects early next year the first trials will be conducted on small numbers of healthy volunteers in Norway England and  after approval from the Food and Drug Administration  the United States Once dose levels are established a series of expanded smallscale trials will take place in countries where leprosy exists As the number of vaccinated people increases the program will begin longterm monitoring to see if the immunization will last Even if all goes well and there are bound to be some problems it will probably be 10 to 15 years or longer before scientists have accumulated enough data on the effects and risks of the vaccine to make it available for widespread use Still the vaccine is essential if the disease is to be prevented In principle we are going to be able to eliminate leprosy Dr Bloom declares The problem will not be the vaccine or drugs but the taboo We will have to change attitudes so that people will seek vaccination and effective treatment The scientific tools will not be enough  Leprosy is a cruel debased demoralizing loathsome and humiliating word that has no place in modern medical science writes Louis Boudreaux a patient at Carville since 1934 and chairman of the editorial board of The Star a bimonthly patientproduced publication Since its founding in 1941 The Star has tried to eradicate leprosy and replace it with Hansens disease But Mr Boudreaux admits it is a losing battle even at Carville It will take more than a change of name to remove the stigma When I found out I had leprosy says Stella Wong not her real name who lives in northern California it was like a walking death She was then 16 years old unmarried and pregnant and her family reacted to the news by sending her away against her wishes They refused to allow the abortion she desperately wanted When her son was born her mother took the baby away from her Only now 15 years later does she spend any time with him He is healthy thank God she says and maybe now we can begin to make up for those lost years Many patients do manage to lead reasonably normal lives Mr Rodriguez the patient from Queens has been married for 20 years and has three children Miss Wong despite her traumatic family situation has been employed as a commercial artist for 10 yearsPAGE 112 Still they bear the scars of the package Mr Rodriguez will not tell any of his neighbors the real reason he cant find work Miss Wong has some facial lesions but they are by no means disfiguring She feels though that men are repelled by her appearance I dont have much of a social life she admits Of course my friends dont care about my disease But she adds wistfully I have only a few friends The recent immigrants who learn that they have leprosy have an even more difficult time of it They start out with a language problem and all the other difficulties of being in a strange country says Joseph Bermudez director of socialwork services at Bayley Seton Hospital on Staten Island Then they get the diagnosis and have to face their families We try to help but its a slow process Their early experiences with medical professionals also make many patients wary of exposing themselves to possible rejection by telling people the true nature of their disease It used to take two to three years before the disease was correctly diagnosed One leprosy sufferer was being treated for syphilis before he was correctly diagnosed This kind of blatant misdiagnosis occurs less frequently now says Dr John Trautman director of the National Hansens Disease Center the main treatment and research facility for leprosy But it still may take as long as a year for a correct diagnosis and proper treatment to begin Once they do find sensitive and competent doctors patients are very reluctant to be treated by other physicians I know that if I tell an eye doctor or a dentist that I have Hansens disease he will shrink back from me just like everyone else one woman says bitterly For this reason patients are alarmed by the closing of the United States Public Health Service hospitals except for the one at Carville under the Reagan Administrations budget cuts Patients can now receive free treatment at several clinics which operate under contract to the Federal Government Some of the clinics operate at the same hospitals now reopened under new names and new management the case with Bayley Seton Hospital others are at different locations The Public Health Service hospitals provided comprehensive medical care the contract covers only treatment of the disease itself and related problems For example a leprosy patient who had a hernia or a broken leg used to be able to get treatment at the Public Health Service hospital now such nonrelated conditions will not be covered  Dr Stephen F Jencks the project officer for the Federal contracts set up by the Public Health Service to care for Hansens disease patients says that his agency will approve any reasonable request by a physician to include a particular treatment as part of a patients therapy But some patients want to have everything provided by the Federal Government and thats just not possible anymore The program is too new to evaluate says Dr Trautman Patients in areas where there has been a strong program including psychological counseling and vocational rehabilitation will probably do just as well under the new arrangement But in areas where there is no such tradition they are just not going to get everything they need Patients especially the older ones are likely to feel that society owes them at the very least comprehensive medical care by doctors they know and trust Mr Boudreaux recalls his early days at Carville Today we can come and go as we please but when I first came here we were treated like prisoners even worse Perhaps because they live in a sheltered environment where their disease is acknowledged and accepted the patients at Carville have been most active in trying to educate the public through lectures to community groups tours of the hospital and especially through The Star Some of the 114 patients still living at Kalaupapa a settlement on the isolated Hawaiian island of Molokai have been even more militant When the State Department of Health decided in 1969 to close down Hale Mohalu a rundown treatment and residential center in Pearl City near Honolulu some patients marshaled community and legal support to prevent the closing of what they had come to consider their second home After a series of hearings the center was closed in 1978 but three patients remain as determined squatters But such displays of assertiveness are rare and will probably be even more infrequent among the foreignborn and insecure population now affected by the disease in this country In Leviticus 1345 it is written that the person with a leprous affliction shall tear his clothes leave his head bare and shall call out Unclean Unclean wherever he goes Being unclean his dwelling shall be outside the camp Citations like these and the Bible is full of them are often given as the source of the stigma attached to leprosy even though the Bible was probably referring to a range of skin diseases not just leprosy But the JudeoChristian tradition is only one of the cultural bases for the stigma For those patients who come from Asia the stigma is if anything even stronger says Dr Robert H Gelber the medical director of the Hansens disease program at Marys Help Hospital in Daly City Calif The Oriental stigma seems to have no particular religious or philosophical base but is related to a sense of fatalism and a belief in reincarnation The person with leprosy is being punished for sins in a prior life according to a common belief and must simply accept his or her fate Though the stigma is milder in America than in other countries it persists The reasons may be partly psychological since the disease represents both loss of physical identity and social acceptance And the introduction of the disease in this country is associated with the Chinese immigration to Hawaii in the 1850s making it plausible that the stigma may be attached not so much to the disease as to the persons of lower status who have it Whatever its source there is no easy way to lift the stigma and to bring leprosy patients back to dwell in the camp We should do everything we can to alleviate the misery of those who are suffering from the disease says Dr Trautman If we can persuade people to come for early diagnosis and if we can demonstrate that early treatment prevents contagion and deformities then perhaps this disease will finally be understood and accepted
"A Prolife Victory, 11,000 to Zero",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/nyregion/l-a-prolife-victory-11000-to-zero-082920.html,The article on the effects of the abortion issue on the Westchester political races Races Said to Turn on Abortion Nov 21 presented only the proabortion version of the results Not only did it not include the prolife side of the story it did not even present factual vote totals the only true measure of an effect on any political outcome In that regard RighttoLife had a banner year in Westchester and the proabortion side was in a word creamed To state that Lew Lehrman would have won if he were proabortion is to ignore that fact that he is exactly that he was not on the Right to Life line because though personally opposed but he would not support the only means to outlaw abortion a Human Life Amendment Being personally opposed gains nothing for the oneandahalfmillion unborn slaughtered each year Mr Lehrman intentionally set out to fool prolifers and we believe he had some success in that devious endeavor In the 36th Senate District race the proabortionists claimed being responsible for making a close race out of what would otherwise have been a lopsided race What they failed to say was that the incumbent did not have the Right to Life line if he had he could have gone to bed early on election night Senator Pisani was very selective when he refused to hold other expenditures hostage and supported a state budget that included abortion funding He conveniently forgets having held the entire state budget hostage for partisan political reasons As to his suggestion that we hold a state referendum on the issue I would point out that both Michigan and North Dakota had such referendums on the state ballots in 1972 The prolifers won both with 63 percent and 77 percent respectively I do not know of any proabortionist willing to be guided by these results the only polls including millions rather than a handful of voters Any claim that the Right to Life line adversely affected the County Clerk race is simply political dishonesty Andrew Spano won because he was linked with the prolife Spano family of Yonkers If being proabortion won him Yonkers by 4000 votes then Mario Cuomo who lost Yonkers by 2000 should also have won Yonkers by 4000 They just cant have it both ways Mr Spano states on the one hand that the abortion issue is not pertinent to the County Clerk race but that on the other hand his being proabortion helped We agree that the issue per se is not an issue in the County Clerk race Is there a Republican or Democrat way of running the office I hope not but each party must field candidates for each office even the Right to Life Party If the incumbent George Morrow won in 1979 because of the Right to Life line when he ran without the Conservative line it can be argued that picking up the Conservative line this year caused his defeat This position would be as ridiculous as is the proabortion interpretation of the results of this race If Mr Morrow was unaware of our Right to Life campaign we certainly were unaware of any support from him If he is quoted correctly we now better understand his lack of commitment to the prolife cause and his apparent attitude that it is better to receive than to give In the judicial races the proabortionists spent large sums of money on radio advertising urging a vote against any judicial candidate appearing on the Right to Life line The Republicans also appearing on the line won the only Republican loser was the only one not on the Right to Life line and he would have won if he were on the line When the proabortion spokesman says she cannot explain this she really means that she preferred not to explain it because it flies in the face of all her previous statements The true conclusion is simply inescapable as any political analyst would agree Since the Right to Life movement has been frustrated by politicians for many years we can understand why the proabortionists would call a press conference The Westchester political results had to be particularly frustrating to them this year after their biggest spending to date So they call a conference to explain the results at least as they see it through rosecolored glasses But explaining doesnt make it so For our part we were delighted with the results We are a political party and they are not If they were really convinced that a proabortion position would help a candidate they would have their own party  the American way That they have not done so is their clearest answer as to why they have not In Westchester County by my observation of the vote results the score stands at approximately 11000 to zero in favor of the prolife movement and will remain so unless and until the antilifers attempt to form their own party and get candidates to agree to run on that platform ROBERT D MCKEON Yonkers Mr McKeon is chairman of the RighttoLife Party of Westchester County and vicechairman of the New York

CONGRESS; ALTERING THE WAY THE HOUSE OPERATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/13/us/congress-altering-the-way-the-house-operates.html,The rules of the House of Representatives always represent a balancing act the rights of the minority versus the rights of the majority free discussion versus efficiency individual independence versus party discipline Now the Democrats in the House are proposing a series of rules changes that could significantly alter these equations in favor of the majority efficiency and discipline In their view the whole way that Congress does business has to be streamlined and their changes would make it more difficult for members to delay the House or force it to vote on embarrassing or extraneous issues The fact is the House is not working very well said Representative Gillis W Long of Louisiana chairman of the Democratic caucus which adopted the rules changes last week We do some of the same things over and over again And that limits our ability to get to matters of pressing importance GOP Vows to Fight Changes But the Republicans have vowed to fight the proposed rules when they are considered by the House when the new Congress assembles next month An unusual statement by the Republican party leadership in the House calls the changes an exercise in political expediency that will concentrate more power in the hands of the Speaker and further erode the democratic process in the House Representative Long concedes that the Speakers power will expand He explains No question when you try to make the institution operate more efficiently you give someone more discretion or power The drive to strengthen the House leadership was set off primarily by the success of rightwing singleissue groups that have forced Congress in recent years to vote repeatedly on such issues as abortion school busing and school prayer To many legislators these are nowin issues they would rather avoid and the Democrats victories in last months election emboldened them to seek solutions One solution would change the way that Congress allocates money Under current procedures the first step is passage of an authorization bill legislation that defines where money can be spent by various Government agencies The second step is an appropriations bill which decides how much can be spent They Use Them as Vehicles In recent years a growing number of legislators have used these appropriations bills as legislative vehicles To take one example the House adopted an amendment Thursday that would forbid the Justice Department to use any of its appropriated funds to pursue desegregation cases that might result in school busing The Reagan Administration has no intention of pursuing such cases anyway but similar riders in the Carter years significantly inhibited the Justice Department Probably the best known of these riders has been the Hyde Amendment which blocks the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortions for poor women In the Vietnam War critics of the war used riders on appropriations bills to slow down and eventually terminate the war effort Under the rules suggested by the Democrats riders on appropriations bill would no longer be permitted The only exception would be if a majority of the House voted to open the bill for such amendments Of course any sort of amendment would still be in order on the original authorizing bill And any change in the House rules would not affect the Senate which has a tradition of unlimited debate and amendment on any legislation Lott Sees Effort to Strangle Still the change would be significant Supporters say it is essential for a more orderly process in the words of Representative Martin Frost the Texas Democrat who headed a committee that drafted the proposed rules But critics like Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip call it an attempt to strangle the opportunity for dissent Mr Lott recalled the use of riders in the Vietnam era and said Liberals resent it when it is used for a conservative issue but favor it for a liberal issue It all depends on whose ox is being gored Mr Frost concedes that this is a valid argument and emphasizes This provision cuts both ways left and right Everyone should understand that The second major rules shift involves constitutional amendments Now if a proposed amendment is buried at the committee level by a hostile chairman a majority of the House can force a floor vote on the proposal by signing what is called a discharge petition Actual passage of the amendment however requires twothirds of the House Fright at Close Call This situation unfolded last summer when the House leadership tried to block an amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget Supporters persuaded a majority of the House to sign a discharge petition and the amendment reached the floor Eventually it failed to get a twothirds vote and did not pass but Democratic leaders were scared to death by their close call according to one lawmaker As a result the new rule would require the discharge petition to cover twothirds of the House or 290 signatures an increase of 72 The net result would be to make it much easier for House leaders to thwart amendments and Representative Peter W Rodino Jr the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee makes no apologies Were only insuring that the Constitution is not tampered with he said Some of the strongest opposition to this particular change however comes from Democrats such as Representative Don Edwards of California perhaps the leading champion of civil liberties in the House Mr Edwards acknowledges that he has tried to bottle up proposed constitutional amendments he did not like including the balanced budget concept But he also feels that the discharge petition is a safety valve a very democratic procedure that should remain unchanged Knife Cuts Both Ways The discharge petition like the appropriations rider has been a liberal tool in other eras And Representative Edwards points out that before this fall the last amendment to reach the floor by the discharge route was the proposed equal rights amendment Some of the other proposed changes are procedural The Speaker of the House for instance would be allowed to waive certain votes that are regularly demanded by the minority as a way of delaying the session and informing their members of the daily schedule Other changes are openly political One would make it easier for either party to strip a member of his or her committee assignments should that member switch parties in midsession Another would bar Democrats from aiding Republicans in election campaigns for Federal office The Republicans concede that they have little hope of blocking the rules changes but they warn that some day they might be in the majority And should that day come asserted Mr Lott the Democrats should expect no quarter
CANADIAN DOCTOR CAMPAIGNS FOR NATIONAL ABORTION CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/13/world/canadian-doctor-campaigns-for-national-abortion-clinics.html,A 59yearold physician who has successfully challenged Canadian antiabortion laws in Roman Catholic Quebec is promoting the establishment of abortion clinics for the rest of Canada The physician Dr Henry Morgentaler once permitted a television crew to film him performing an illegal abortion and he subsequently spent 10 months in prison before his sentence was overturned He is now campaigning for clinics in all major Canadian centers to bypass what he views as a cumbersome discriminatory and dangerous procedure for legal abortions The physician has been advising a Toronto group on starting a clinic like the one he built in Montreal Such freestanding clinics are technically illegal After Toronto we would like to see walkin clinics in Winnipeg and wherever there is a need he said He has also declared himself willing to offer abortions on demand regardless of legal curbs which has provoked outrage from abortion foes Among the attacks was a large cartoon in The Toronto Sun showing him in a cemetery digging graves for small coffins Law Allows Abortions in Hospitals In an interview at his home in Montreal Dr Morgentaler said that Canadian law permits abortions in hospitals if special committees in the institutions determine that there is a threat to the health or life of the woman He said however that about half the hospitals including the Catholic ones have no committees and perform no abortions Of the others he said some are extremely conservative and timid turning down most applicants while a few are quite liberal The result is that wealthy women travel to the US while poor women are forced to have unwanted children Dr Morgentaler says he takes strength from a recent Gallup poll showing that more than 75 percent of the sample believed that abortion was a private matter of choice Long before such publicopinion polls he said he was confident there was great popular support for his position despite the opposition of church and state and he based his basic strategy on this belief By May 13 1973 when Dr Morgentaler was shown on nationwide television performing an abortion he had already provoked the authorities with his oftenrepeated assertion of having completed 5000 illegal operations As he expected he was charged and tried and as he expected he was acquitted by a jury It was quite remarkable he recalled In Quebec I an atheistic Jew who would not swear on the Bible was acquitted by a Catholic jury I knew they would not convict a man who was simply practicing medicine to aid others without gain Verdict Set Aside But under Canadian criminal law the prosecution can appeal a jury acquittal An appellate tribunal not only set aside the verdict but as was then possible also substituted its own ruling of guilty and sent him to prison for 18 months After 10 months the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the appellate decision and ordered another jury trial He was again acquitted and he has since run his clinic unhindered in Quebec
SERVICE THAT CONCERNS 'UNPLANNED PARENTHOOD',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/16/opinion/l-service-that-concerns-unplanned-parenthood-102056.html,To the editor The timely OpEd Dec 8 article by Alfred Moran vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City correctly assesses the hypocrisy of the television industry in refusing contraceptive advertising while countenancing sexual provocation and innuendo at every turn TV must share in the responsibility for changing sexual attitudes and for some of the untoward consequences among them the rise in pregnancies of unwed teenagers But Planned Parenthood should also look to itself for greater leadership in the area of enlightened education Heir to the social movement initiated by Margaret Sanger it shares her goals of sex education and contraception for responsible parenthood However in recent years much of its energies and resources have gone into the provision of abortion facilities Lowcost abortion services are necessary and should be readily available but that purpose would best be served by an affiliated organization Planned Parenthood is for planned parenthood Abortion is for unplanned parenthood IDA GELBER Brooklyn Dec 9 1982
SENATE UNIT DROPS REAGAN'S DEADLINE FOR VOTING ON MX,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/16/us/senate-unit-drops-reagan-s-deadline-for-voting-on-mx.html,The Senate Appropriations Committee voted a tough new restriction today on President Reagans ability to buy MX missiles The limits go beyond a compromise the President endorsed Tuesday and amount to another setback in the Administrations struggle to win Congressional approval of the missile system The amendment adopted today which was proposed by Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina contains most of the provisions of the compromise It would appropriate 988 million to buy missiles but would bar the President from spending any of it until both houses of Congress ratified plans for deployment of the weapons The new restriction is that the amendment does not contain the deadline for Congress to conduct a ratification vote The President considered that a key part of the compromise Deadline Is Friday Night The Presidents proposal was never brought up today because his supporters apparently realized they would lose Four Republicans provided the key votes in support of the Hollings measure which won by 16 to 12 Their defection dramatizes the growing unhappiness with the MX on Capitol Hill and some lawmakers are starting to examine alternatives to the missile which is designed to be the largest and most accurate in the American arsenal The amendment was added to an omnibus spending bill called a continuing resolution which was reported to the floor by a voice vote tonight The resolution must pass Congress by Friday night to keep the Government running It is necessary because most of the basic spending bills that finance Government operations have yet to pass even though the fiscal year is almost three months old Jobs Measure Approved Added to the Senates agenda tonight was a bill passed by the House that would require automobile manufacturers selling cars in the United States to use substantial percentages of American parts labor and advertising services But passage in this session was considered unlikely Page D1 Earlier in the evening the Senate narrowly defeated a similar proposal by Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio that would have affected the steel and cement industries The MX proposal that the Senate panel approved would appropriate the money but tie the Presidents hands until Congress untied them Last week the House voted to eliminate 988 million for production of the MX which stands for missile experimental The White House which is afraid of a filibuster by foes of the missile favors a rider that would force Congress to vote on the matter by April 15 The Hollings amendment contains no time limit but when the continuing resolution comes to the floor probably on Thursday Administration supporters will probably try to insert language requiring Congress to act quickly Legislators are increasingly concerned that President Reagans plan to space 100 MX missiles closely in a base in a corner of Wyoming would never survive a Soviet attack The plan informally called dense pack is based on the theory that incoming missiles would kill off one another in a phenomenon described as fratricide But today Senator Hollings voiced doubts that the plan for close spacing would ever be approved by Congress no matter what timetable is set Weve really got the same thrust in both houses he said after the vote today  Dense pack is dead Senator Arlen Specter a Pennsylvania Republican who voted for the Hollings rider today said The vote shows a very deep concern about whether an acceptable basing mode can be found for the MX I believe the President is entitled to every presumption but there is a limit Accordingly a growing number of legislators are now saying that Congress might have to scrap the MX missile and explore proposals for a smaller and more maneuverable landbased missile Meanwhile the Senate continued to debate legislation that would raise the gasoline tax 5 cents a gallon and use the receipts to repair the nations bridges roads and mass transit systems Baker Backing Gas Tax Bill The gas tax bill was being filibustered by a group of conservative Senators but Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader vowed to press for its passage We owe it to ourselves the Ohio Democrat asserted to insure that every penny collected through this new tax go toward creating jobs for our people But Senator John H Chafee Republican of Rhode Island denounced the measure as an attempt to tax American drivers to subsidize a small elite of highly paid steelworkers Mr Chafee pointed out that as Congressional sessions draw to a close many special interests try to dip into the public till You can just hear the hogs moving up to the trough slurp slurp slurp he said It is estimated that the highway improvement bill which has the backing of the White House and Congressional leaders from both parties would put 320000 workers on the payroll rehabilitating roads and renovating bridges When the House adopted its version of the continuing resolution Tuesday it added 54 billion for a second jobcreating package President Reagan has vowed to veto the resolution if it contains any such package but some Republicans believe a compromise is possible Hatfield Offers Jobs Program Today Senator Mark O Hatfield the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee proposed his own job program of just under 1 billion for weatherization of hospitals construction of waste treatment plants and other public projects Like many Republicans he is concerned that the White House position will only aggravate the image of Republicans as insensitive to the unemployed These are not leafraking activities Mr Hatfield told the committee They are programs which will result in tangible benefits for the nation The committee added 250 million to the Hatfield proposal for military housing and 26 million to repair the Alaska Railroad The entire jobs package was then approved by voice vote Some legislators have suggested a trade the Democrats get extra money for jobs and the White House gets looser restrictions on spending MX money Asked about this possibility the White House spokesman Larry Speakes said Well just have to wait and see how things shake down Dual Pay System Favored As they wound their way through the complex continuing resolution Appropriations Committee members voted to keep House and Senate salaries at the present level although the House voted Tueday to raise them by 15 per cent to 69800 But the Senators agreed that when the issue came up in conference they would go along with a proposal to increase the salaries of representatives and senior Government executives while keeping Senate salaries at the present level 60662 In endorsing the twotier system Senator Ted Stevens Republican of Alaska pointed out that House members suffered greater financial hardships because they had to run for reelection every two years while Senators enjoyed a sixyear term Moreover Senators can make much more money giving speeches because they are better known and thus do not need the extra salary Senator Stevens said In supporting higher pay for Representatives the Senators hope to strike a bargain that allows them to make unlimited amounts of outside income The House jealous of senatorial opportunities to make outside money wants to limit that extra income to 30 percent of base salary which is the same for both houses The Senate committee also reversed the pattern of recent years and voted to allow Federal workers to use Federal health benefits to pay for abortions Senator Hatfield argued that such decisions should be made by the collective bargaining process and his position was upheld 15 to 12 A number of money bills in recent years have barred the use of Federal benefits for abortions but the legislators increasingly feel that antiabortion groups have lost some of their political strength and can be defied with less risk
A BILL WITH PARAGRAPHS FULL OF PLUMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/16/us/a-bill-with-paragraphs-full-of-plums.html,The Big Sandy River in Eastern Kentucky overflowed in 197778 causing 200 million in damage to the district served by Representative Carl D Perkins a Democrat who is chairman of the Education and Labor Committee Mr Perkins used his political muscle to persuade Congress and the Army Corps of Engineers to initiate a floodcontrol project the Yatesville Lake Construction Project which would receive 8 million under an omnibus spending bill that the House approved on Tuesday Representative Silvio O Conte Republican of Massachusetts the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee called the Houses attention to the project That is an 8 million earmark as far as I can determine he said for a project that would have reduced the 200 million damage from the flood by 5000 that would have reduced the worst flood in history by 25 inches and that according to the Corps of Engineers will operate in the red for its entire 100year economic life as a recreational facility The total cost by the way is estimated at 200 million Whatever the case the House had no opportunity to vote on the projects merits It was lumped in with scores of other projects grants priorities and general advantages bestowed in the omnibus spending bill The socalled Christmas tree bill provides a singular opportunity for the horsetrading at which many members excel Although this enhances solidarity among members of Congress it often puts them at odds with the White House which is likely to be more fiscally austere It Seems to Lurch to the Next Introduced a century ago when it was used sparingly the omnibus spending bill has become so common that Congress seems to lurch from one such bill to the next unable to give separate attention to the 13 individual spending bills that the omnibus measure supplants It has increasingly become a major vehicle for Congressional patronage and policy The omnibus bill has evolved from being a bill that merely tided the Government over for a few weeks pending adoption of the individual appropriation bills to legislation that has taken the place of the individual appropriation bills and lasts most of the fiscal year Instead of merely continuing the level of spending at the current rate a practice that gives the the bill the name of continuing resolution the spending bill now sometimes grants increases in some areas using different formulas for various Government departments In an even greater departure the bill also often includes changes in the laws Because it deals with money and has some urgency legislators regard the bill as a prime vehicle for new proposals In the House Democrats tacked on a public works jobs program worth 54 billion while Senate Republicans hope to include 988 million in money for production of the MX missile In past years the bill has bogged down in disputes over abortion school prayer and busing as well as the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor House members given the opportunity on Tuesday to delete funds for only three projects did so at the expense of the breeder reactor and water projects in Nebraska and North Dakota House members also used the bill to vote themselves a 15 percent raise From Sea to Shining Sea The bill was leavened with money for dozens of national parks from Acadia to Yosemite and scores of national widlife refuges from Hawaii to Pittsford Vt There were funds to remodel prisons curb beach erosion repair veterans hospitals and remodel military housing There was not supposed to be an omnibus spending bill this year President Reagan asked for the postelection session to enable Congress to adopt all 13 individual spending bills But Congress has thus far approved only three dealing with Housing and Urban Development military construction and the Legislative branch Sponsors of the omnibus bill are invariably shamefaced No one regrets having to operate as we are having to do this year more than I said Representative Jamie L Whitten Democrat of Mississippi chairman of the Appropriations Committee We started almost two months late because we did not have an agreement on the budget ceiling also other circumstances beyond the committees control have made it necessary for us to have the continuing resolution But the problems are more complicated Congressional leaders do not want to send separate foreign aid spending bills to the floor for example because they fear that Congress would reduce such funds in the face of a recession at home and also fear that Israel would be rebuked and Israeli funds curtailed The last LaborHealth and Human Services spending bill to be adopted by Congress was in 1979 and Senate leaders did not even try this year lest it become mired in disputes on social issues It All Began in 1876 Use of omnibus spending bills dates from 1876 when Congress adopted a 10day measure that appropriated funds on the basis of the current level of spending The bill was needed because then as now Congress had not completed work on the individual spending bills needed to finance the Government in a fiscal year In the 19th century however such bills were relatively rare and covered short periods of time But since 1954 at least one such bill has been enacted every year Initially of short duration they became increasingly lengthy Government financing for most of the 1982 fiscal year was adopted in an omnibus spending bill that provided funds from March 1 through Sept 30 when the fiscal year ended The President vetoed as extravagant an omnibus spending bill last Christmas and has threatened to veto the bill adopted by the House on Tuesday House Democrats however hope to lure Mr Reagan to the bargaining table and involve him in the horsetrading
SHARING AMBROSIANO'S LOSSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/business/sharing-ambrosiano-s-losses.html,As much as 1 billion in bad debts may have been lost in Italys longrunning Banco Ambrosiano scandal a scandal in which the Vatican still appears deeply involved although it denies any wrongdoing And the question of the hour for Italy and for the Vatican according to Italian investigators is how much of the loss the Roman Catholic Church should cover After a summer intermission the stage is being set for the second act of the melodrama involving Italys biggest postwar bank failure Its theme will be a subtle struggle of wills as Italys financial authorities seek to persuade the Vatican that it should shoulder some of the financial responsibility for what has gone wrong Italian officials trying to clear up the Ambrosiano tangle know this will not be easy The Vatican is an independent state outside Italian law But the real difficulty they say is that negotiating with the papacy is very different from negotiating with any other foreign government Not Like Other Negotiations This is not like other negotiations acknowledges a key Italian figure in the talks just getting under way between Italy and the Vatican We are dealing with the Holy See Time has little meaning for the Vatican Nevertheless signals of concern are being raised from behind the wall of silence that traditionally surrounds the Vaticans financial affairs  Last month the Pope and the College of Cardinals accepted a report on Ambrosiano by three Catholic lay bankers that the Vatican says clears the Holy See of any wrongdoing and concludes that it was unwittingly duped by the late Roberto Calvi the head of Banco Ambrosiano who apparently committed suicide in June The report has not been published  The Pope also said publicly however that the Vatican must reform its finances and rely more on direct contributions from the faithful rather than on financial deals Henceforth the Pope said the Vaticans financial objectives do not include the creation of economic assets and the enrichment of income  The Pope has also agreed after some hesitation to cooperate with the Italian authorities in a second joint investigation into the scandal  The Pope acknowledged that the Vatican bank Instituto per le Opere de la Religione was the owner of several of the Latin American and Caribbean shell companies to which Mr Calvi lent about 13 billion of Banco Ambrosiano money Much of this money cannot be traced But the Vatican said it did not know it had owned the companies and had played no role in their management Permanent Oversight Panel The panel of three lay bankers is to become a permanent oversight group watching over the Vatican bank reportedly at the insistence of the American and German cardinals who are worried that Catholics in their countries who are the Vaticans principal contributors will become less generous as a result of the scandal Thus in a dramatic departure from traditional secrecy the Vatican has set up an outside board of directors to oversee its bank Herman Abs a Catholic banker who led Deutsche Bank has joined the panel at the urging of Germanys Josef Cardinal Hoefner Meanwhile Archbishop Paul C Marcinkus the American prelate who runs the bank says he is not resigning because IOR is innocent of wrongdoing But he has moved from Rome into the Vatican where he is immune from arrest or subpoena by Italian magistrates Flexiblity at Vatican Italian financial officials say these developments indicate that the Vatican is preparing itself to accept some responsibility for the losses and to become more open about its finances The fact that the Pope agreed to a new investigation is a victory for our view that something went wrong in the Vatican argues a high official in the Italian Treasury Ministry The first act of the Ambrosiano scandal opened in London in June when Mr Calvi often called Gods Banker because of his close financial association with the Vatican was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge A coroners court called the death a suicide but Italian officials seem skeptical and are pursuing their own investigations Mr Calvi had joined Banco Ambrosiano as a clerk and worked his way up to president Through a series of elaborate financial deals he transformed what had been a small regional bank closely associated with the Catholic Church in northern Italy into a major financial institution reporting assets of 18 billion including funds held for depositors Loans to Shell Companies At the time of his death Mr Calvi was appealing a fouryear jail sentence for illegal currency exports and Banco Ambrosiano was being investigated by Banca dItalia because of the huge loans it had made to obscure shell companies mostly in Panama and in Nassau the Bahamas About half the loans came from the Milan bank and the other half from its Luxembourg subsidary Banco Ambrosiano Holdings Vatican involvement first became apparent when it was disclosed that Archbishop Marcinkus a close associate of Mr Calvi had issued what bankers call letters of comfort to Mr Calvi in connection with these shell companies The letters implying the Vatican had an interest in the companies are often used to reassure lenders that a borrower is reputable The Vatican says it received a secret letter from Mr Calvi in return absolving it of all responsibility for the companies but Italian investigators say they have not actually inspected this counterletter The counterletter which was demanded by Archbishop Marcinkus would show that the Vatican was simultaneously telling the world it had an interest in these companies while secretly assuring itself it didnt one Italian official says Money Owed to Vatican Officials say that the Vatican bank appears to have been owed the shell companies about 112 million and that Archbishop Marcinkus was a director of Banco Ambrosianos Nassau subsidary through which many of the loans were channeled Six months after Mr Calvis death the most significant new information that Italian investigators have unearthed is the likely fate of much of the 13 billion that he had lent to the shell companies Last month Nino Andreatta then Italys Treasury Minister told Parliament that about 400 million was used by the companies to buy shares in Banco Ambrosiano these are worth little since the bank is in liquidation Another 400 million was used to pay interest on the companies outstanding loans and also has been lost The remaining 460 million has not been accounted for Italian investigators suspect that at least some of this money went to PropagandaDue Masonic Lodge with which Mr Calvi and many of his friends were associated How much will be recovered is unclear Offsetting Assets Banco Ambrosiano and its subsidiaries had some direct assets including a stake in Banco Gottardo in Switzerland that officials of Italys central bank value at about 300 million This would put the net loss on the loans at about 1 billion The Italian Government says it will take responsibility for the foreign loans made directly by Banco Ambrosiano But it has declined any responsibility for those advanced by the Luxembourg subsidiary saying that help can come only from the Vatican Italian financial officials appear eager to protect the reputation of Italian banking by getting to the bottom of the affair And they hope the scandal will encourage the Vatican to reform its finances and make them more transparent In addition Carlo Ciampi governor of Banca dItalia is also known to be determined to demonstrate his political independence by pursuing the investigation to the end since an earlier attempt to investigate Banco Ambrosiano in 1978 provoked a powerful political backlash that cost the central banks previous governor Paolo Baffi his job and led to the brief imprisonment of Mario Sarcinelli then head of the banks regulatory division Seeking Negotiated Settlement Italy also wants to put pressure on the Vatican by convincing Banco Ambrosianos foreign creditors to drop any future lawsuits against the Vatican bank if the Vatican pays them a negotiated sum Just how much the Vatican will pay in the end has become a favorite Roman guessing game Anything between 1 percent and 99 percent one official says Vatican observers say two factions have emerged among the Popes advisers  the Marcinkus faction which refuses to admit any guilt and those around Agostino Cardinal Casaroli the Vatican Secretary of State who seem more flexible Another uncertainty is that no one outside the Sacred College has any real knowledge of the Vaticans wealth As any tourist knows the Vatican museum contains art worth incalculable sums But a senior Italian official estimates that the Vatican bank probably has only about 200 million to 300 million in capital and owned investments while managing about 1 billion of money deposited by religious orders and dioceses around the world A question mark also hangs over the position of the new Italian Government Mr Andreatta the former Treasury Minister had wanted to use the case to force changes in Vatican finances His aim was to make the Vatican bank set up a subsidiary under Italian law to handle its lira transactions and at least publish a balance sheet But Mr Andreatta is not in the new Government and some here say its leader Amintore Fanfani may be less willing to press the Vatican He sided with the Holy See in unsuccessfully opposing the legalization of divorce and abortion in Italy in 1975
HOW GAS TAX LOST IN SENATE; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/us/how-gas-tax-lost-in-senate-news-analysis.html,How is it that three conservative Republican Senators can frustrate the will of President Reagan the leaders of both parties and the overwhelming majority of the entire Congress The Senators used a filibuster to deal a crippling and perhaps fatal blow to an increase in the Federal gasoline tax sought to finance highway repairs and aid mass transit By contrast 48 other Senate Republicans today urged the leadership to do everything it could to revive the measure Enraged Senate Republican leaders bowed to the filibuster Thursday and withdrew floor consideration of the gasoline tax increase and highway legislation acknowledging that any delay made passage difficult if not impossible Egos Bigger Than Senate Before they did so the 54 Senate Republicans gathered in the old Senate chamber to discuss strategy and berate the filibusterers in voices loud enough to be heard in an adjacent corridor Are the egos in this place bigger than the institution of the US Senate asked one lawmaker The Republicans were angry at the success of a filibuster rooted in a combination of factors the inevitable strains of a postelection session and the lawmakers desire to be home for the holidays the shortness of the session the ideological convictions of those conducting the filibuster and some tactical mistakes on the part of the Republican leaders Those conducting the filibuster Senators Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Jesse Helms of North Carolina were flying in the face of a consensus that evoked unusual anger Tempers Are Very Short I have never seen the kind of anger that is being expressed behind closed doors said Senator William S Cohen Republican of Maine People are perceived as having abused the procedures and failing to support the leadership Normally there is great deference around here toward people who seek to use the rules but today tempers are very short The filibusterers argued that an increase in the gasoline tax would be regressive and counterproductive with the burden falling on working people who were least able to pay They said it would be bad policy to raise taxes in a recession and that the proposed tax increase would cost more jobs than would be provided by the program Senators call their institution the worlds greatest deliberative body and it is true that the Senate usually subjects bills to intensive scrutiny It often takes years from the introduction of legislation until its enactment But the proposed 55 billion annual increase in the gasoline tax received only one day of hearings in both House and Senate committees and was approved by the committees the next day Opponents contended that three weeks from the bills introduction to floor consideration represented a legislative steamroll Putting People Back to Work Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders returned to Capitol Hill for the postelection session convinced that the results of last months elections constituted a mandate for Government action to help put some of the 12 million unemployed Americans back to work The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee worked out a legislative agreement with the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts and then persuaded the reluctant President to endorse the measure To Mr Reagan it was a highways bill to Mr Baker it was a highwaysjobs bill and to Mr ONeill a jobs bill The Speaker delivered his end of the bargain last week when the House approved the bill by a vote of 262 to 143 But Mr Baker ran afoul of a determined filibuster waged by two freshman Senators Mr Humphrey and Mr Nickles and a veteran filibusterer Mr Helms Neither Senator Baker nor Mr ONeill wanted the postelection session which was requested by the President to enable Congress to complete action on 13 individual spending bills  a goal that will remain largely unmet Both legislative leaders had argued that such sessions tend to be perilous Meanness of Short Sessions Its a shriveled process filled with meanness ugliness and pettiness Senator Alan Simpson a Wyoming Republican said of any postelection session All of us who served in state legislatures found the same thing It gives rise to suspicion Everybody tries to protect himself It was for precisely this reason that the Congressional leaders tried unsuccessfuly to dissuade Mr Reagan from requesting the postelection session The short session gives unusual power to those conducting a filibuster because they need only hold out for a few weeks Two of the filibusterers are running for reelection in 1984 One of them Senator Humphrey can now say with some justification that his presence has made a difference Senator Helms who also will be seeking reelection in 1984 is an old hand at filibusters and has delayed votes for weeks and months but has usually bowed to the wishes of the majority rather than seeking delay for the sake of delay But in this case because of the shortness of the session delay was an end in itself Senator Nickles the third filibusterer is completing his second year in the Senate Few secondyear members have received the attention that Mr Nickles has received in this debate Betrayal by Reagan Seen In addition to their contentions that a higher gasoline tax would be regressive and counterproductive the three Senators said that Mr Reagan had betrayed his conservative constituency by endorsing the proposal As conservatives the filibusterers have faced two years of frustration and resented not only the Presidents endorsement of last summers tax increase but also his failure to mobilize support on their agenda of social issues including abortion busing and school prayer Although Mr Reagan lobbied for the legislation and met with those conducting the filibuster some Republicans believe that his cause was hurt by his insistence that the measure was not a jobs bill By denying that it was a jobs bill they didnt help it politically said Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon Theres nothing embarassing about suppoting a jobs bill But its almost as if the Administration hates to say they are supporting a jobs bill because that admits the failure of their economic program The worst tactical error by the Senate Republican leadership was probably its move to invoke cloture before the Democrats had an opportunity to gain Senate approval of an extension of unemployment benefits Under Senate rules the Democrats could not get a vote on that proposal after cloture was approved The Democrats then uncharacteristically voted with the conservative Republicans and helped defeat the cloture motion
SENATORS APPROVE MOVE ON MX FUNDS BACKED BY REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/us/senators-approve-move-on-mx-funds-backed-by-reagan.html,The Senate working around the clock in an attempt to adjourn before Christmas today adopted a compromise endorsed by President Reagan that would allocate the money to build MX missiles but prevent him from actually spending it until Congress approved The President sought and won a provision that would force Congress to vote on the missile system this spring and not delay the matter indefinitely On Wednesday the Senate Appropriations Committee passed a similar measure but left out the time limit Mr Reagan announced that he would name a bispartisan commission to study how to base the MX before he made new recommendations to Congress Page 13 Out of Money at Midnight The Senate amendment on the MX was added to a stopgap spending bill called a continuing resolution that is needed to finance the Federal Government after it runs out of money at midnight tonight Lawmakers are expected to work through the weekend on the measure but it faces the possibility of a Presidential veto A nominal shutdown of Government functions is possible on Monday The cause of the veto threat is the likelihood that Congress will include in the continuing resolution a multibilliondollar package aimed at creating jobs in the face of soaring unemployment The jobs issue is one of dozens of matters acted on by the Senate in the allnight session and discussion continued tonight on a large group of proposed amendments Once a bill is finally passed it will have to be reconciled with the Houseapproved version in a conference committee that may start work on Satruday Jobs Package Approved By a vote of 50 to 46 the Senate today backed a 12 billion jobs package proposed by Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon The House has passed a 54 billion program sponsored by the Democratic leadership Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader warned that inclusion of the jobs package was highly likely to invite a Presidential veto But lawmakers in both parties are eager to show their concern for the 12 billion jobless as the holiday season approaches These people are unemployed now Senator Hatfield said and we need to give them some symbol of hope House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr also mentioned the plight of the unemployed at Christmastime and urged Mr Reagan not to veto the continuing resolution The time has come for compromise not obstructionism he said The Massachusetts Democrat said he had accommodated the White House by scheduling several of its favorite bills for floor action this week and added I am trying to cooperate with the President but it is a twoway street The Senate went into session Thursday morning to consider a bill to raise gasoline taxes by 5 cents a gallon When that legislation was blocked by a filibuster the lawmakers took up the continuing resolution on spending at 10 PM Thursday and worked on it into Friday evening Senators grabbed naps on cots and sandwiches on the run as they struggled to meet two deadlines One was the expiration of the current continuing resolution the other was their desire to get home to their families One victim of the drawnout session was a plan by Speaker ONeill and some of his friends to attend the Tangerine Bowl on Saturday in Orlando Fla Mr ONeills alma mater Boston College is playing in the game the schools first bowl game in 40 years The continuing resolution is necessary because only three of the 13 basic appropriations bills needed to finance the Government have been approved by Congress even though the 1983 fiscal year is almost three months old The bill contains many major decisions that could influence Government activity for the rest of the fiscal year and that is why so many lawmakers are taking so much time in offering amendments Several Issues Decided Some of the issues decided by the Senate in the last day included these  The Senate voted 59 to 37 in favor of compromise language that would allow the Federal Trade Commission to regulate professionals if states did not act first The American Medical Association and other professional groups have lobbied vigorously for an exemption from FTC jurisdiction and their proposal passed the House this year The issue will be settled in conference  By one vote the lawmakers retained funds to continue construction of the Clinch River breeder reactor which is in Tennessee the home state of the majority leader Money for the project which has been denounced as a wasteful case of pork barrel politics was not approved by the House and the conferees will try to resolve the dispute  In another narrow vote the Senate agreed with the Appropriations Committee to allow Federal workers to use health benefits to pay for abortions The vote was another sign of the declining power of political forces that oppose all forms of abortion The House bill contains a ban on the use of such benefits for abortions  A move sponsored by Senator Daniel Patick Moynihan Democrat of New York to trim Senate staff levels by 10 percent was defeated 68 to 25  The Senate let stand a committee amendment that would reimpose current limitations on Congressional pay House members voted to increase their pay to almost 70000 from 60662 and the conference will have to resolve the knotty issue One possible deal would allow House members to increase their salaries and let Senators earn unlimited outside income while retaining their current salaries Military Budget Untrimmed The Senators also fought off several attempts to trim the approximately 233 billion military budget included in the continuing resolution Senator Slade Gorton Republican of Washington proposed cutting 56 billion by slashing all functions except money used to keep the armed forces combatready I do not believe Senator Gorton said that the defense budget has been subject to the same scrutiny or discipline as other parts of the budget This will put us on record that there are no sacred cows But Senator John Tower Republican of Texas retorted that the Senate had already cut 16 billion from the Pentagons request he called the Gorton rider a meat ax slash A motion to table Mr Gortons proposal carried 52 to 45 A proposal by Senator Carl Levin Democrat of Michigan to take money earmarked for a nuclear aircraft carrier and use it to strengthen conventional forces was defeated by an even larger margin Defeats Move to Kill MX In the debate on the MX which took place in the early morning hours today the Senate defeated a motion by Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California to eliminate all funds to buy the missile The Senator a possible candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination argued that building the missile would only accelerate the costly nuclear arms race being pursued by the United States and the Soviet Union but his motion lost 70 to 28
THE POET WHO FOUND HER OWN WAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/books/the-poet-who-found-her-own-way.html,ZAMI A NEW SPELLING OF MY NAME By Audre Lorde 256 pp Watertown Mass Persephone Press Paper 795 CHOSEN POEMS OLD AND NEW By Audre Lorde 115 pp New York W W Norton  Co Cloth 1295 Paper 595 CARRIACOU is an actual West Indian island as well as the isle of Audre Lordes imagination Zami is a Carriacou name for women who work together as friends and lovers And while the publishers claim that in Zami Miss Lorde creates a new form biomythography combining elements of history biography and myth is a bit pretentious the book is actually an excellent and evocative autobiography Indeed among the elements that make the book so good are its personal honesty and lack of pretentiousness characteristics that shine through the writing bespeaking the evolution of a strong and remarkable character The reader quickly grows to love the sturdy little black girl  daughter of parents immigrated to New York from Grenada before she was born  who is tonguetied unable to see without her glasses who forces herself to stay awake half an hour after her parentallyimposed bedtime in order to listen to the stories nightly serialized by her two older sisters who in her loneliness dreams of having a little female person all her own yet who yearns for the magical moments of privacy disallowed by a stern mother who considering solitude a social perversion insists that Audres bedroom door remain open except when she is studying constantly studying With her we experience the pain of her gradual recognition of racism something from which her powerful mother seeks for years to protect her the suicide of a teenage best friend for whom she has been able to do nothing With her we leave the rigid confines of home  a Washington Heights apartment  at 17 to become marginally selfsupporting to endure at times hunger an abortion and Christmas alone We share her growing awareness of her attraction toward her own sex her first affairs with women a longedfor trip alone to Mexico at 19feelinglike35 on one of those journeys that serve as routes for psychic discovery and life as a gaygirl in the Greenwich Village of the 50s We live with her through her first primary love relationship and its excruciating conclusion and finally an affair with a black Southern woman  Afrekete  whose sensuality and independence equal her own it is a relationship that becomes metaphor for her conciliation with her own reality and with the world Throughout her experiences are painted with exquisite imagery Indeed her West Indian heritage shows through most clearly in her use of word pictures that are sensual steamy at times neartropical evoking the colors smells  repeatedly the smells  shapes textures that are her life Her attention to detail is exacting whether shes describing a supper of hot tamales and cold milk in Mexico City or an evening of barhopping in the West Village of two decades ago Her use of language is often imaginative but uncontrived as in her description of her first lover Ginger as having high putchy cheeks or her reference in one of the many meals deliciously detailed in the book to chopped onions quailed in margarine Yet Miss Lorde is at her best when her images become  as they often do  metaphors for states of being A torn stocking caught in the wind on the side of a tenement building becomes symbol of her terror when as a small child she hangs by one hand from the window of her apartment only to be saved by her mothers timely return home Or the day she has begun her first menstrual period Left alone by her usually everpresent mother in the kitchen she crushes with mortar and pestle the garlic onions and celery leaves that will season the meat for dinner as she pounds  and pounds and pounds  she becomes carried away the scents from the ground herbs mixing with her own And her membership at Hunter High School in what she calls The Branded The Lunatic Fringe is really her wider membership in that part of the population made up of artists blacks women and homosexuals Despite her obvious poets ease with symbol metaphor image her references to herself as poet  a vocation held since childhood are unemphatic  sometimes there was food cooked sometimes there was not Sometimes there was a poem and sometimes there was not And always on weekends there were the bars she writes describing life with her lover Muriel And while her downplaying of her commitment to poetry may be partly an attempt to avoid widening the distance between the reader and herself there is the sense in Chosen Poems as in Zami of a writer who has other more pressing concerns  such as cooking a meal making a living or simply living out the life style that for many homosexuals is an avocation in itself It is as though the life on the streets was so rich that it left little time for meticulous literary stitching up in some West Village or Staten Island tower Miss Lorde now lives according to the cover of Chosen Poems on Staten Island teaches at Hunter College in New York City she is distant from Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton who out of isolation even alienation made language scream or Cynthia McDonald and Marilyn Hacker with their intricate linguistic embroideries This imperative immediacy sometimes gives Miss Lordes poems an undeveloped abstract air leaving one wishing for the exacting detail of her prose the evocation of the undeniable concrete world made fully tangible in Zami At the same time Miss Lordes poems are refreshingly removed from the pale frozen works of many poets who appear immobilized by the image of themselves as poet Instead she is a poet of her time her place her people and unlike poets whose works fall apart when fused by conviction she is at her best in her most political pieces I inherited Jackson Mississip pi For my majority it gave me Emmett Till his 15 years puffed out like bruises on plump boycheeks his only Mississippi summer whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie as a white girl passed him in the street and he was baptized my son for ever in the midnight waters of the Pearl So she writes in Afterimages a poem in which her empathy extends finally even to the white woman who has caused Emmett Tills terrible death In the more recent poems in this volume which draws from works written over 30 years she employs increasing imagistic skills yet even some of the earlier poems  such as Martha a long piece about a woman hospitalized and fighting for her life are strong enough to give a reader the kind of gutlevel jolt Emily Dickinson deemed the most reliable judgment of a poem To read both these volumes is to feel at least for a few hours that one has lived not merely intellectualized Audre Lordes life Throughout each one is aware of the authors growth toward an unusual autonomy For readers who begin with Zami Chosen Poems will serve as recognizable markers for that journey and since the autobiography concludes in 1960 an extension into presenttense awareness Her works will be important to those truly interested in growing up sensitive intelligent and aware in the second half of the twentieth century in America
TV VIEW; DOES FAMILIARITY BREED ACCEPTANCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/arts/tv-view-does-familiarity-breed-acceptance.html,Televisions ability to excite flamboyant behavior is by now a given observers have remarked on how relatively sane individuals and crowds respond with bizarre antics to the sparkle of a lens But at the same time that such performances indulge the ego they are likely to result in at least a temporary setback for any cause that the performers think they are championing Such was the case with the Black Panthers according to Kathleen Cleaver who used to hold the title of communications secretary of the Black Panther Party Writing in the current issue of Channels of Communication on How TV Wrecked the Black Panthers she maintains that television not only played up the Panthers more menacing activities rather than their more positive ones but also attracted recruits whose behavior before the cameras frightened white America One need not accept Miss Cleavers kindly assessment of the goal of the Panthers as a commitment to obtaining justice for blacks to grant that she has a point that television probably did give the Panthers a shove along their suicide route But you dont have to be a Black Panther to hold a grudge against television or recognize its ability to turn off those who are tuning in It has been suggested that George McGoverns 1972 campaign was doomed on the nights leading up to his nomination for the Presidency when television displayed to middle America the radical elements that had captured the Democratic Party Changes in convention rules had brought large numbers of women minority groups and the tieless young to Miami that summer and their meeting with the television cameras was an instant love match Add to those unconventional conventioneers the fringe group of in Theodore Whites description roving dropouts and drifters who won the attention of television news crews by blockading McGovern in his hotel suite and the effect on millions of viewers could have been predicted As Av Westin the experienced ABC News executive has observed in an unTVlike understatement The sight and sound of a passion displayed by a protestor affects a viewer differently than reading the word anger  Did the television news teams consciously desire to scare the folks at home away from the Democratic Party Not at all Rightwing rowdies would have been accorded the same attention with much the same result Indeed whereas any movement in behalf of the poor can arouse a degree of understanding and even sympathy from the people in television those on the other side have few friends around the studios Some of the producers at the 72 convention no doubt recognized the damage that was being done to their preferred candidate that year but much as they may have detested Richard Nixon they were caught up in the toils of their medium Should the television producer do surgery on this symbiosis with societys most rabid critics Is he to resist the colorful the unusual the extravagant Is he to turn away from political actingout Why Isnt such behavior news Television newsmen after all are not supposed to be arbiters of taste If a bunch of whites in hoods march through a Jewish neighborhood or a bunch of blacks with guns walk into a public building dont we expect to see the scene on the evening news What does television do as well Can a producer help it if some activist upon spotting a network logo begins taunting a policeman Should the cameraman put a cap over his lens Much has been made of the power of television to direct or distort viewers perceptions of the world But those doing this directing or distorting are in fact severely constrained The masters of the medium often become servants of individuals and groups who cracked though they may seem are sane enough to get the camera turned in their direction Who is exploiting whom The segments that compose a news program are so brief that there is barely time to leaven a startling image with a rational comment And there is not always any great desire to do so Local news shows in particular ever in need of lively material can be veritable orgies of mutual manipulation But there is something else going on Although the shortterm effect of having oddlooking people invade ones living room via the tube is to startle and scare over the long term television accustoms its large audience to new fashions from bearded faces to braless breasts to new kinds of behavior attitudes opinions that are likely to offend the more conservatively inclined and give rise to charges that television is undermining the nations morals Television teaches us that familiarity breeds acceptance It picks up fast on trends and makes them familiar and ever more acceptable to the untrendy public by repeated showings on the news in documentaries and by their incorporation into situation comedies and even commercials When the Afro made its first appearance on the tube a decade or so ago sported by angry young men the hair style must have seemed menacing to many but in a wink it was adopted by performers made smart Soon actors who played cops as well as those who played revolutionaries were affecting Afros and the style has since become so acceptable that it is no longer even stylish Television gobbles trends like a football fan gobbles salty snacks Often this has worked to speed social change in directions that most of the nation welcomes The presence of middleclass blacks in commercials for everything from cars to decongestants is at once testimony to the buying power of black viewers and a nightly message to white viewers that blacks are like everyone else All credit to television But the mediums message is not always so widely welcomed or so clearly benign Formerly unspeakable phenomena like abortion homosexuality promiscuity are not only spoken of but sympathized with even championed by the trend setters or followers behind the cameras There are granted limits Cocaine may be in style in Hollywood but it is not being pushed on television As for political outsiders no matter how many times the Klan marches or successors to the Weatherpeople rampage they are not likely to become popular with the home audience But the sight of the McGovern forces would not today shock many people out of their Democratic socks similarly the noisier Moral Majoritarians and feminists who may have struck some as a trifle wild at first outing have simply become part of the scene To return to Miss Cleavers complaint once the Panthers walked into the California State Assembly on May 2 1967 with their guns showing by mistake says Miss Cleaver and the cameras trailing on purpose says Miss Cleaver the groups fate was sealed The threat was too blatant Had the Panthers been able to resist their own inclinations and the invitation to be superoutrageous their heightened militancy of bearing and rhetoric would in no great time doubtless have been accepted by most viewers simply as part of the passing show
PREGNANT WOMEN USE FOSTER HOMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/archives/pregnant-women-use-foster-homes.html,FAMILY SERVICES of Westchester a nonprofit private agency based in White Plains is trying to find temporary shelter for pregnant teenagers and women in their early 20s According to the agency a number of unmarried pregnant women are forced to leave their homes to avoid conflict with their parents or their male friends So far agency workers have placed a dozen such women in foster homes now they are making a concerted effort to find more people willing to take in a boarder who is expecting a baby Were looking for people who will fill the role of adjunct supports to the agency said Patricia Auth director of the Family Services division of adoption and childrens services The average length of stay is four months although it may be shorter We will pay the host 820 a day to cover cost of board the pregnant border will take care of her own personal needs and will understand that she should not expect to be served Family Services which is supported by the United Way and by public and private funds provides services to county residents of all ages Included in its work is counseling unmarried pregnant women on what Mrs Auth calls life options Such alternatives as abortion adoption and keeping the child are discussed The counselors see about 200 such young women yearly ranging in age from about 14 to 27 Of these according to Mrs Auth about 80 percent want to carry the baby to full term and at least half of them express a need for some sort of shelter We get maybe 100 requests for shelter a year she said In considering this issue it doesnt matter whether the young woman intends to bring the baby up herself or plan for its adoption the important thing is finding a place where the person can live while she is pregnant The womens financial situations she said vary from being a welfare recipient to being economically comfortable The reasons women feel they must leave their own homes are varied caccording to Mrs Auth who added that for some it could be a matter of maintaining privacy and anonymity Having decided to carry the baby to term a young woman realizes she does not want anyone in her own community to know about her pregnancy Or as happens frequently her parents might make that decision for her We hear of many families who cannot culturally accept it Mrs Auth said Theres an expectation on the part of the parents that this will not or cannot happen to their daughter So theres anger there can even be physical violence For some older teenagers or for women in their 20s who are living alone Mrs Auth said the problem is not family reaction but inability to pay the rent If someone can no longer work because she is pregnant she may seek shelter until she has had the baby and is able again to produce an income There are also women who live with male friends but then confronted with a pregnancy the man may become abusive sometimes physically Family Services social workers counsel their clients during the pregnancies offering assistance with emotional and practical problems At the same time they try through word of mouth personal contact and local media to find appropriate boarding accommodations  Prospective hosts are interviewed by the agency and should have nurturing understanding personalities according to Mrs Auth and no strong bias against outofwedlock pregnancies Single women can be hosts although single men can not Foster families are also told that taking in a pregnant woman is in no way a shortcut to adopting a baby even if the woman decides not to keep the child Those interested in the program can call 9488004 Mrs Auth reported that the clients and host families who have so far participated in the program have been pleased with the results One client was a 14yearold girl from a large family with traditional values the family felt it would be better for her to be housed temporarily elsewhere There was another 14 year old whose mother thought her sibling should not be exposed to the pregnancy and a woman 23 years old who moved here from Great Britain three years ago I was determined not to leave America and go home the woman said Id not go home under any circumstance like that I was living at the home of my employers and things were fine until I was in my ninth month Then one day we had a terrible row and I needed someplace to go I lived with a wonderful family for two weeks Although things eventually worked out fine with my employer Im still very close with my foster family A friend of that foster family is Rita Bachop 55 who is also taking in pregnant teenagers boarding them for as long as needed in her large home in Yonkers I have 11 children she said but only three are at home now When I heard about this program I asked my husband and he said sure Ive always wanted a big family Maybe its maternal instinct  Id like 20 children As for the girls well well just be a sounding board well just listen if they need us Lynne Ames
Torpedo for Family Planning,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/opinion/torpedo-for-family-planning.html,Because Senators Hatch and Denton suspected Federal funds were being used to promote abortions in some family planning clinics routine audits were remarkably stepped up last year Although violence was done to some patients privacy the auditors reported no violations of the law The General Accounting Office did say however that the Department of Health and Human Services needs to set forth clear guidance on the scope of abortion restrictions Two weeks ago the department chose to issue guidelines which lack the force of law rather than regulations which require a period for gathering and considering public comment Given their nature and their possible use as criteria for Federal grantgiving the guidelines are more accurately called a noose Instead of offering clear guidance the department proposes to strangle with red tape 74 family planning clinics that also perform abortions  44 of them in hospitals Under the guidelines family planning and abortion clinics may not share space personnel publications supplies entrances or exits That means a doctor working in one of those 74 clinics can prescribe a contraceptive but cant perform an abortion The same counselor cant advise the woman who wants to end a pregnancy and the woman who doesnt Two of everything including doors Administrators of clinics faced with such restrictions will be swamped in construction requisitions personnel and cost Assuming of course that they dont stop trying altogether to provide complete family planning service for their mostly poor patients How does one satisfy or even interpret a requirement to discontinue relationships which potentially may give the impression that Federal funds support the abortion activities It is hard to contest the description of the new guidelines by Representative Waxman of California an organized attack on family planning programs Theyre also an attempt to sneak a change in Federal policy past the legislative process
"DEAL ON MX, RESISTANCE ON GAS TAX IN SENATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/weekinreview/deal-on-mx-resistance-on-gas-tax-in-senate.html,WASHINGTON TO President Reagan the last few weeks on Capitol Hill must have seemed like a bad dream On Sunday morning television Senator Robert Dole of Kansas the chairman of the Finance Committee was slamming the President for not taking a stronger lead on Social Security On the Senate floor a cadre of conservatives of his own party was holding up the proposal he has blessed to raise the gasoline tax by five cents a gallon saying that taxes always cost jobs rather than create them In private meetings the Republican leadership rebelled against his plan for basing the MX missile forcing acceptance of a compromise that saves the President face but ties his hands until Congress unties them As the weary lawmakers tried to finish their business and get home for Christmas Senate Republicans still acted like a loyalist majority on many key votes during the week such as preserving funds for a nuclear aircraft carrier against liberal attack But from adoption of a 12 billion public works package to passage of a provision allowing Federal workers to use health benefits to pay for abortions it was clear that the Presidents allies are newly aggressive about their own interests A lot of us are not willing to go over the cliff for the President and the leadership wont push us said a Republican Senator from the Northeast who faces reelection in 1984 You see so much more independence now More on Congressional actions page 2 That independence was accelerated by last months Congressional elections in which many Republican Senators barely escaped defeat and 26 House Republicans lost their seats To some Republicans the White House has yet to grasp the implications of the new political climate Theyre certainly having difficulty in the White House figuring out what will sell in Congress said Senator Dole who is increasingly outspoken in his criticisms of the Administration If the White House thinks it has difficulty dealing with Congress over the last year wait until next year Mr Dole considers himself a conservative but a realist The job of the Republican Party in the Senate he says is to pass laws not make speeches And his real fear is that Mr Reagan will stick rigidily to his economic game plan even in the face of mounting evidence that it is not working Some of us wonder if he knows who his friends are said Mr Dole During the first half of Mr Reagans term Senate Republicans were euphoric to be in the majority after three decades of minority status and unified behind the man who had led them there There were always critics but for the most part the executive plotted strategy and the legislators followed Now some of the directives are moving in the other direction When Mr Reagan seemed enamored of the idea of advancing the third year of his tax cut Congressional leaders told him bluntly that the concept would not fly He backed away When he seemed determined to fight for the MX in the face of growing Congressional doubts emissaries from Capitol Hill told him to compromise or lose He reluctantly went along Such events give some Republicans hope that the White House might be more realistic about its relations with the new Congress But already the Senate leadership is testing a new way of operating  through closer relations with the Democratic leadership in the House When Congress returned after the elections determined to craft some form of jobs legislation it was Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr and House majority leader Thomas P ONeill Jr who met to forge the deal Senator Baker has said several times that he hopes to keep the relationship going He has at least two reasons One is that Mr ONeill will be a much stronger figure in the 98th Congress With 26 more Democrats in the House a purebred Republican program stands little chance Second should the White House prove intransigent the Senator is preparing the way for the bipartisan Congressional leadership to set the legislative agenda not the President One sign of the modus operandi came yesterday as Senator Baker and Speaker ONeill met privately to try and figure out what sort of omnibus spending bill might avoid a veto To a certain extent deteriorating relations with Congress are inevitable two years into a Presidency All leading politicians are overexposed these days said Senator Bob Packwood the Oregon Republican who has frequently criticized Mr Reagans political judgment You wear out your welcome And if the election frightened some Republicans it embittered some Democrats who had backed the Reagan program He opposed a number of Democrats very actively including me said Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma And the 1984 Presidential campaign has already begun have its influence Both Mr Dole and Mr Baker would like another shot at the GOP nomination should Mr Reagan decide to withdraw Looking ahead the relationship between Senate Republicans and the White House will turn on the answer to many questions Will the Reagan economic program start to work If it does not will the White House understand the economic and political need for greater Government efforts to stimulate recovery Will Mr Reagan respond to the growing criticism of his defense spending increases Will he be more willing to move on Social Security  last weeks meeting of a blueribbon panel was cancelled until White House wishes were made clearer  or allow it to linger on to become Democratic electionyear issue again Above all will Mr Reagan understand that the victories of 1980 cannot be repeated unless he and his party reach out to traditionally Democratic constitutencies such as labor and minorities As one Congressional aide put it There are not enough golfplaying Republicans to retain control of the Senate or recover the House in 1984
"IDEAS AND TRENDS; DECADE AFTER LANDMARK RULING, ABORTION CASES BESIEGE COURT",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-decade-after-landmark-ruling-abortion-cases-besiege-court.html,There is a certain symmetry in the abortion debate returning to the Supreme Court after a long run in Congress and the state capitals of the country Almost a decade ago  Jan 22 1973  the Court decided Roe v Wade the landmark ruling that made abortion legal and in the process spawned a national political preoccupation The five cases now before the Court are in a sense products of that preoccupation The Justices have for their constitutional scrutiny an array of obstacles that state and local legislators have placed in the path of access to legal abortion Anyone numbed by the abortion spectacle played out in Washington this year  from the Senate hearings on when human life begins to President Reagans assertion that threemonth fetuses have been born to grow up as normal human beings to the disarray of the antiabortion drive in Congress  may be forgiven some confusion over what is at stake in the Supreme Court The pending cases argued a few weeks ago and due to be decided in the spring have been widely described as vehicles for the Courts most searching reexamination of abortion since Roe v Wade But are they Probably not True the cases which involve laws from Virginia Missouri and Akron Ohio cover a range of antiabortion strategies The obstacles they set up include secondtrimester hospitalization requirements and Akrons mandate that doctors warn patients that abortion may have dire psychological consequences Such measures raise the financial and emotional price of a legal abortion It is also true that whatever the Court decides will set the terms for the next round of legislative debate But the essential holding of Roe v Wade that the right to have an abortion is a fundamental part of the constitutional right to privacy is not in question Even if the Court upheld every aspect of the challenged laws which is unlikely an adult woman who was confident of her decision to end an unwanted pregnancy and who made the decision promptly enough to avoid the secondtrimester hospitalization requirement would find her access to abortion essentially unimpeded That is not the case for women intimidated by what Akron describes as its choiceenhancing ordinance for those who through fear or ignorance delay seeking help until the second trimester for the young for the poor Teenagers who account for about a third of the 15 million abortions performed annually in the United States have the most at stake Both the Akron ordinance and Missouris state law require parental consent albeit with the chance to appeal to a judge before certain teenagers can get abortions those under age 15 in Akron under 18 in Missouri While many teenage girls receive parental support for their decision others  often the victims of child abuse or incest  do not For them a consent requirement means added stress and delay The Courts overall approach to the issue may be more telling than the way the Justices decide individual questions The Courts premise has been that a restriction on abortion is presumptively unconstitutional and that the burden of proof is the governments which must justify the restriction In the name of deference to state legislatures the Reagan Administration has asked the Court to turn that analysis upside down to presume that abortion restrictions are valid and to require plaintiffs to shoulder the burden of proving unconstitutionality When Solicitor General Rex E Lee made that argument the Justices listened politely  except for Justice Harry A Blackmun the author of Roe v Wade who appeared personally offended by the presentation But politeness is not tantamount to agreement In a dozen postRoe decisions the Court has shown no interest in fundamentally changing its approach to abortion It is not likely to accept the Administrations invitation to do so now The pending cases however do pose a challenge to the analytical structure of Roe v Wade and it will be interesting to see how the Court responds Originally the Justices dealt with pregnancy as a medical continuum along which the relative interests of the pregnant woman the state and the fetus shift over time In the first trimester the Court ruled there could be essentially no interference with the abortion decision In the third trimester the legal interests of a viable fetus were considered such that the state could forbid abortion except when the womans life or health were threatened It is the Courts judgment regarding the second trimester when 10 percent of abortions are performed that is currently at issue The Court had held that because secondtrimester abortions were relatively dangerous the state had a legitimate interest in the health of a pregnant woman during that period which it could assert by imposing healthrelated regulations such as limiting secondtrimester abortions to hospitals In the last 10 years however technology has improved the safety of late abortions A year ago the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists even amended its standards to permit most secondtrimester abortions to be performed in freestanding outpatient clinics as well as hospitals Logic seems to dictate that the Court should adjust its abortion boundaries accordingly But that is a riskstrewn path Once the Court announces in effect that constitutional law must keep pace with advances in medical technology there is no obvious stopping place If the constitutional boundary between first and second trimester makes little sense now how soon before the boundary between the second and third is obsolete And what of the increasingly early viability of the fetus These are questions the Court may prefer to leave unanswered for now
CONGRESS DROPS JOBS PROGRAM AND MX FROM FUNDING MEASURE IN COMPROMISE TO AVOID A VETO,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/20/us/congress-drops-jobs-program-mx-funding-measure-compromise-avoid-veto.html,A HouseSenate conference put together a rapid sequence of compromises tonight in concluding its work on a bill to keep Government agencies operating Monday The conference agreed to eliminate the money to build MX missiles as the Democratic House did last week It did appropriate 25 billion for research and development of the weapon And under threat of a Presidential veto the conferees also voted to eliminate all money aimed at creating jobs and alleviating the nations 108 percent unemployment rate The panel also compromised on providing 22 billion in military and economic aid to Israel Page A12 Senate Passes Money Bill Before it recessed at 830 tonight the full Senate approved its version of the emergency spending bill and took up a proposal to increase the gasoline tax and use the money to repair highways The Senate voted overwhelmingly to limit debate on that measure which was endorsed by President Reagan and was highly popular in Congress because it would create an estimated 350000 jobs The bill had been jeopardized by a conservative filibuster Page D11 The compromise version of the omnibus spending bill included neither the Senates 12 billion jobs package nor the Houses 54 billion program Senator Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona said as he emerged from the conference The reality is that it was going to be vetoed There wasnt much hope of getting it Veto Had Been Threatened Mr Reagan had threatened to veto any bill that contained money for jobs programs on the ground that it would add to the budget deficit and make no appreciable difference to unemployment Advocates of the programs insisted on Congress taking quick action to aid the jobless This may be a victory for the President Senator DeConcini said but I think its a defeat for the unemployed people in this country The spending bill called a continuing resolution would extend to the end of the current fiscal year Sept 30 1983 The conference actions must be approved by both houses on Monday before being sent to the President A Federal spokesman said a judgment would be made by noon on whether a bill acceptable to President Reagan would be approved by the end of the day If not he said most employees would be furloughed The Governments legal authority to keep many agencies operating had expired after midnight Friday President Reagan has fought hard for money to build the MX which stands for missile experimental He has proposed deploying it in a tightlypacked formation known as dense pack but this concept met with broad skepticism in Congress Many lawmakers agreed with Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina who called the plan something out of Ripleys Believe It or Not Peter H Roussel the deputy White House press secretary said by telephone tonight that he could not say for sure what the Presidents reaction would be if the bill reached his desk with no production money for the MX That remains an unanswered question Mr Roussel said It hadnt come up before in this way Everybody was focused on the jobs bill The House had voted to eliminate the 988 million earmarked for the production of the first five MX missiles After President Reagan sensed the growing opposition to his plan he endorsed a proposal that would appropriate the money but bar him from spending it until both Houses of Congress approved his plans for deployment of the weapon This proposal backed by the full Senate also set a definite date for Congressional action on the missile When the House negotiators proved adamant tonight the Senate agreed to eliminate all procurement funds As Representative Joseph P Addabbo the Queens Democrat who led the opposition to the MX said There is no justification for this procurement There is no way to give anyone 1 billion when they dont know what to do with it The strong wave of skepticism toward the MX reflects a feeling among lawnmakers that their constituents want them to take a closer look at the Pentagon budget particularly when social programs have been trimmed substantially In an interview Mr Addabbo said tonights decision sets Congress on the path of examining all weapons systems and not just approving the Pentagons bills He also predicted that President Reagan would not veto the bill explaining This is a formula he can live with Not What Reagan Wants Senator Ted Stevens Republican of Alaska conceded that the MX vote was not what the Administration wants but said Its good or better than what they might have expected getting from the House position In another action on a disputed weapons system the conferees agreed with the House to eliminate production funds for the Pershing missile which has a history of trouble in test flights But 30 million was added to the bill to train Pershing missile crews While Congress defied President Reagan on the MX they bowed to his demands on jobs The lawmakers came back to Washington determined to demonstrate concern for the unemployed workers they had talked to in the election campaign but President Reagan adamantly opposed what he called make work programs that would have little appreciable impact on the nations 108 percent jobless rate The President stressed that the programs would add to the budget deficit already expected to approach 200 billion Many legislators also believed that he found the clamor for a jobs bill embarrassing since it signaled the failure of his economic program to improve the employment situation The conference action was unusual since the House had included 54 billion for public works programs such as weatherizing hospitals and housing projects The Senate had included 12 billion But the veto threat proved decisive Many Republicans have argued recently that unless Mr Reagan focuses more directly on programs to stimulate economic recovery and relieve the suffering of jobless workers his party could suffer devastating defeats inthe 1984 elections Earlier in the day the conferees agreed to a bargain that would increase the pay of House members by about 9000 but keep Senators at the current level of 60662 However the Senators would be allowed to esarn unlimited amounts of outside income which in most cases would more than make up for their lower pay scale Action on Reactor and FTC In other action the conferees agreed to keep alive the Clinch River breeder reactor a 32 billion experimental nuclear project in Tennessee They also rejected any limitations on the right of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate doctors and other professionals The vote on the Senate spending bill known as a continuing resolution was 63 to 31 It came after the legislation had been held hostage for six hours last night by conservative Senators trying to defeat an attempt to raise the gasoline tax The bill was freed for a vote only after the tax opponents made a tactical error and lost their right to the floor in the early hours of the morning The Federal Government is required by law to shut down after bills authorizing expeditures expire But Edwin L Dale Jr a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said after both houses recessed that all Federal employees were expected to report for work He said Federal officials will meet and make a judgment whether it is likely that a continuing resolution can be passed by Congress and signed by the President before the end of the day If there is no reasonable certainty that such legislation can be signed all but essential personnel will be furloughed at noon As the Congressional logjam showed signs of breaking the dispirited lawmakers seemed to brighten up Senator J Bennett Johnston Democrat of Louisiana wore a bright red sports jacket on the floor Senator Stevens said Theres an entirely different attitude around here now that we know we can be home for Christmas The Christmas spirit is seeping onto the floor But the struggles and frustrations of the last week have prompted many legislators to question the wisdom of the President in demanding that they return for a postelection session It Really Was a Dumb Idea Everybody is reaching the conclusion that it really was a dumb idea to have a lameduck session said Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont It has accomplished nothing that wont have to be done over again in the spring The President should have listened to the members of his own party who advised against it Many members are particularly angry that so many of their spending decisions are now being made in continuing resolutions Such a resolution is necessary because only seven of the 13 appropriation bills that normally finance the Government have been adopted Instead of drafting a complex resolution now many lawmakers now think it would have been better to adopt a simple statement before the elections continuing Government operations at current financing levels The new Congress convening in January could then have taken up the issue again Senator Leahy noted that since time is short in a postelection session and since a continuing resolution covers so much territory there is room for incalculable mischief if a few lawmakers are determined to strip the legislative gears Sensitive and Risky Issue of Pay Congressional pay is one of the most sensitive and politically risky issues that face the lawmakers They have repeatedly been afraid to raise their salaries which have stood at 60662 for more than three years The rationale behind the bargain struck today is that House members have greater financial burdens since they have to run every two years while senators enjoy a sixyear term Also senators are far better known and can supplement their income more easily by speaking to special interest groups House members would prefer an acrosstheboard increase for everybody while limiting outside income But the Republicandominated Senate refused to go along Representative Vic Fazio the California Democrat who has led the fight for a pay increase said he would accept the deal reluctantly Im not very happy with the differential he said I personally feel that outside income in the Senate is out of hand and that will become clearer as time goes on Under todays agreement House salaries would increase to about 69800 but outside income would be limited to 30 percent of that figure Some senators agree with Mr Fazio and say that it is bad policy for lawmakers to depend on outside groups who want to influence Congress for part of their income But other lawmakers retort that it is a violation of their basic rights to limit their ability to provide for their families The pay agreement would also increase the salary of the Vice President and the Speaker of the House to 91000 from 79125 and the pay of Cabinet secretaries to 8000 from 69630 In addition it would give raises of up to 15 percent to more than 34000 civilian and military officials whose salaries have been frozen at 57500 Agreement on Clinch River The House had voted to kill the Clinch River reactor but the Senate had preserved it by one vote The agreement provides 181 million a cut of about 20 million from Senate levels but bars any new construction on the project and mandates a study of its usefulness Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas denounced the reactor as a technological turkey and said that it only survived because it was in Tennessee the home state of Senator Howard H Baker Jr the majority leader On the Federal Trade Commission the Senate had adopted language that permitted the panel to regulate professionals only if states do not do so The language was designed to head off a move pushed by the American Medical Assocation to bar the commission entirely from the field However the House advocated no restrictions on the commission and the Senate went along The issue is likely to recur next year In other action the House agreed to Senate language that permits Federal workers to use their health benefits to pay for abortions Under current law workers are not allowed to do so The conferees agreed to drop language barring the leasing of potential oil fields of the California coast but similar language is contained in an Interior Department appropriation bill that has been sent to the President
PRESIDENT DECIDES TO SIGN FUNDS BILL DESPITE LOSS OF MX,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/21/us/president-decides-to-sign-funds-bill-despite-loss-of-mx.html,The White House announced shortly after midnight that President Reagan would sign an emergency spending bill to provide money for a large segment of the Federal Government that technically ran out of funds at midnight Friday Meanwhile the President won his Senate battle for a 5centagallon increase in the gasoline tax early this morning A vote of 56 to 34 sent the bill to a HouseSenate conference The House had already recessed for the night Page D29 Government workers had reported to their offices Monday but a White House spokesman said that the President felt an obligation to clarify the spending bill situation before the workday began this morning Aides said Monday that Mr Reagan would act as soon as he received the legislation called a continuing resolution from Congress but delayed a formal announcement while the Senate debated the gasoline tax The spending measure a compromise worked out in conference committee of the two versions approved by each chamber passed 232 to 54 in the House and 55 to 41 in the Senate Republican leaders had urged President Reagan to sign the money bill even though it failed to provide the production funds he requested for the MX missile Earlier Monday the leaders had predicted that Congress would override any Presidential veto No Money for Jobs The appropriations bill included no money for public works jobs program Both houses had endorsed the concept but the conferees retreated under the threat of a Presidential veto The continuing resolution was ratified Sunday night by a HouseSenate conference after an unusual 10hour Sunday session The legislation is necessary because Congress has failed to pass six of the 13 appropriations bills that normally finance Government functions even though the fiscal year is almost three months old The resolution would carry through to the end of the fiscal year on Sept 30 It covers some of the largest Government departments including Defense Labor and Health and Human Services President Reagan vetoed a similar bill last year at Christmastime Congressional leaders had feared that Mr Reagan would veto this measure because of the elimination of MX production funds The Administration however had said it was studying the provision of money for research and development to see if any of it could be used to build missiles Page D29 Congress is eager to leave town for the holidays and Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader said that the President would lose all his leverage on other bills once the continuing resolution was signed The President had also been pressing Congress to pass his Caribbean Basin initiative but that measure is locked in a parliamentary maze and Congressional leaders were searching Monday night for some way to extricate it As they debated the continuing legislation on both sides of the Capitol Monday many lawmakers voiced unhappiness with many of its provisions Representative Joseph R McDade Republican of Pennsylvania summed up the general mood when he said I dont believe anybody is happy with this result In the end Congress responded to the pressures of time and the counsel of those who said that compromise was of the essence For now Representative Jim Wright of Texas the majority leader in the House said we have a responsibility to keep the Government functioning We Made Our Point Like many Democrats Mr Wright said he was bitterly disappointed at the decision of the conference to drop all money for a public works jobs program The House had supported a 54 billion program and the Senate had approved 12 billion but the President had vowed to veto the bill if either was included Privately some Democrats were neither surprised nor distressed by the conference committee move They had promoted the jobs legislation primarily to spotlight what they consider failings of the Reagan economic program and as one House leader said Monday with a broad smile We made our point The conference agreement specifically urged President Reagan to include a comprehensive jobs program in his 1984 budget which is now being prepared and many legislators said that jobs and economic recovery would be the first order of business when Congress reconvened next month Dissent on Missile Move If some Democrats were angry about the conference decision on jobs some Republicans were equally enraged at the elimination of 988 million to build the five MX missiles Senator John Tower the Texas Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee said the decision could have severe adverse consequences for national security undercutting President Reagans position in arms control talks Senator Tower was also furious that the continuing resolution approves 357 million for the purchase of A10 fighter aircraft The plane which Mr Tower said was not needed is built near the home district of Representative Joseph P Addabbo a Queens Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handles defense appropriations Mr Tower called the decision a horrible example of porkbarrel politics and said money would be better spent on F16 fighters He did not say that F16s are made in his home state The conference agreement provides 2485 billion in aid to Israel 785 million in grants for general economic support and 17 billion in loans for military sales of which 750 million need not be repaid The Reagan Administration had requested the same overall amount divided in the same way between economic support and military sales but the Presidents proposal would have forgiven only 500 million of military loans Some lawmakers were highly critical of a conference decision to pay for three hotly debated construction projects including the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in Tennessee and irrigation and flood control projects in North Dakota and Nebraska They vowed to refight the battle next year So did Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois who opposed a decision to allow Federal workers to use their health benefits to finance abortions

BAKER AND O'NEILL PREDICT PRESIDENT WILL BACK JOB BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/25/us/baker-and-o-neill-predict-president-will-back-job-bill.html,Washington Dec 24The leaders of the House and Senate have agreed to reintroduce legislation to create public works jobs when Congress reconvenes Jan 3 and they say they expect President Reagan to support such an effort Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee the Senate majority leader and House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts say they expect a public works jobs bill to be at the top of the agenda of the new Congress Both say further that they expect the President who has assailed such programs as counterproductive makework legislation to reverse himself and support the measure in an effort to reduce unemployment now at 108 percent White House Denies a Shift A White House spokesman said tonight that there was no truth to the but in an interview as the 97th Congress drew to a close Howard H Baker Jr the Senate majority leader said I would anticipate that the President will support some form of jobs program Both the House and the Senate approved separate public works jobs bills in the postelection session of Congress but they were withdrawn under threat of a Presidential veto The Speaker and the Senate leader did persuade Mr Reagan to indorse a highway repair program that supporters say will create 320000 jobs and they expect to work together again on a public works jobs program that will win the Presidents support Congress has shown increasing independence but that support is still important President Reagans dominance of the first session of the 97th Congress did not carry through the second session that ended Thursday in which he encountered major obstacles But the President nevertheless set the overall tone and agenda Couldnt Meet Deadlines The frenzied finale in which lawmakers approved a stopgap spending bill and the roads program financed by a gasoline tax increase contrasted with a languid start in which Congress spent four months sorting out budget priorities As in the past Congress lurched from one spending crisis to the next and its failure to adopt individual spending bills led the President to request a postelection session that only confirmed Congresss inability to meet spending deadlines In the waning hours of the session the lawmakers shelved the proposed jobs legislation that had been attached to the stopgap spending bill in both the House and Senate The threatened veto would have jeopardized the overall measure which was needed to finance the Government The lawmakers responding to a worsening economy and rising unemployment did show increasing independence They rewrote Mr Reagans budget increased taxes and rejected his plea for a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget But Mr Reagan left his philosophic imprint on them and he succeeded in continuing to reduce the size and scope of government as reflected in the budget adopted by Congress The President also continued to set the Congressional agenda and although Congress may have nibbled around the edges it generally accepted his priorities It reduced Mr Reagans proposed increase in military spending for example and denied him production funds for the MX missile but it approved the largest peacetime increase in military spending in history Similarly Congress followed the fiscally austere agenda set by the first session But it did not go along with all the cuts in social programs proposed by Mr Reagan and in particular rebelled against a plan to reduce the Social Security deficit Republicans on Capitol Hill became increasingly sensitive to Democratic charges that Mr Reagan was aiding the rich at the expense of the poor and sought both to lessen the poor and sought both to lessen the impact of domestic cuts and to close tax loopholes for the rich Largest US Deficit Yet Mr Reagan proposed and Congress approved the largest deficits in the nations history as rising unemployment deprived the Government of needed revenues and placed added demands on benefits and services The Democrats said military spending and the tax cut sought by Mr Reagan caused the large deficits while Republicans held that they were the results of decades of Democratic profligacy Congress gave short shrift to the Presidents proposal of a new federalism which would give more power to the states but make them bear the cost of more programs and it also spurned his plan to abolish the Energy and Education departments Congress also rejected the Presidents agenda on social issues including abortion busing and officially sanctioned school prayer These issues had been a major focus of Mr Reagans 1980 campaign but he had placed them on the back burner until Congress acted on his economic program Conservatives had viewed Mr Reagans election and a Republicancontrolled Senate as a singular opportunity for action on those issues but they were thwarted by filibusters conducted by Senate liberals The Presidents threats to campaign against incumbent members of Congress which helped him win approval of his budget and tax proposals in the first session lost their potency in the year when the nation actually went to the polls Trims in Military Spending Mr Reagans staunches defenders in Congress told voters that they were certain trims could be made in the military budget proposed by the White House As the session drew to a close leaders of the Republicancontrolled Senate and the Democraticcontrolled House entered into a spirit of cooperation and Mr Reagan became increasingly isolated from Capitol Hill Social Security reforms which members of both parties acknowledged were needed to preserve the solvency of the system were left unaddressed Democrats exploited the issue in the Congressional campaigns and both they and the Republicans were apparently fearful of alienating voters by recommending either a reduction in benefits or an increase in taxes that most agreed were needed Also left undone were legislation to revise the immigration laws a revision of the regulartory process a bankruptcy bill and domestic content legislation that would require a certain percentage of the parts in automobiles sold in the United States to be manufactured here As in the first session the budget was a major legislative vehicle and mandated changes in scores of laws in order to effect spending reductions At a Standstill For the first four months of the session Congress was at a virtual standstill as the White House and Senate Republican leaders sought to work out an agreement on the budget The negotiations had their origin in Mr Reagans proposed budget of 7576 billion for the fiscal year 1983 which began Oct 1 the budget initially projected a deficit of 915 billion Both Republicans and Democrats considered that projection unrealistically low and were proved correct The final projection was more than 150 billion The disagreement between the two parties was on how to bring the deficit down Republicans sought greater reductions in social programs while Democrats sought greater reductions in military spending and an increase in revenues A Gang of 17 representing the White House and Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders sought vainly to reach a compromise In the end Mr Reagan journeyed to Capitol Hill on April 28 for a meeting with Speaker ONeill but the meeting erupted in recriminations The budget was actually written by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Pete V Domenici Republican of New Mexico and reluctantly accepted by the White House But Mr Domenicis proposal for a threeyear 40 billion saving in Social Security through benefit cuts or new taxes was rejected by Congress as too controversial in an election year These are the major actions taken in the second session of the 97th Congress Military Spending Congress approved the largest peacetime increase in military appropriations in the nations history a budget of 231 billion which was 14 billion less than Mr Reagan sought Congress rejected the Presidents request for 988 million for production of the MX missile but continued 25 billion for the missiles research and development Congress also approved funds for a new nuclear carrier and for the B1 bomber Budget Congress approved a 769 billion budget for the current fiscal year with a projected deficit of 1039 billion But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that deficit would really be more than 150 billion To achieve its budget targets Congress came up with 657 billion in spending cuts and 209 billion in new revenues Congress also increased the debt ceiling to 1290 billion Taxes Scarcely a year after approving a tax reduction Congress approved a threeyear tax increase of 983 billion needed to reduce the deficit The White House said the measure was not really a tax increase because for the most part it closed loopholes and tightened enforcement Foreign Policy An individual foreign aid spending bill was again deferred because Congressional leaders feared that the lawmakers might want to reduce such funds in the face of a recession and reductions in funds for domestic programs The leaders also feared that an individual spending bill could lead to a rebuke of Israel because of its invasion of southern Lebanon So foreign aid spending was continued for the most part at previous levels Congress did not complete action on the Presidents program of special tax and trade benefits for the Caribbean Basin and the Senate rejected a Housepassed bill authorizing creation of Radio Marti to broadcast to Cuba Welfare Congress made additional reductions in the expected growth of Food Stamps Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Supplemental Security Income but those reductions were less than the Administration had sought The rate of growth of the food stamp program was reduced by 548 million while the aid to families program was reduced by 343 million and the supplemental income program by 386 million over three years Civil Rights Congress approved a 25year extension of the enforcement section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and made it easier to prove certain voting rights violations Labor Congress approved a 10week extension of unemployment benefits last August and last week it added up to six additional weeks for areas with the highest unemployment It also approved a training program intended to provide instruction and other assistance to poor people unable to find jobs SOCIAL ISSUES Senate filibusters killed leglisation that would have banned most abortions and allowed officially sanctioned prayer in the public schools The House killed a Senatepassed bill that would have ended courtordered busing to achieve integration HEALTH Congress approved ceilings on Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors and required employers to offer workers eligible for Medicare comparable coverage under private health plans The lawmakers rejected a proposal to exempt physicians from the Federal Trade Commissions jurisdiction but they approved legislation to promote the development of orphan drugs which drug manufacturers consider unprofitable because they treat rare diseases ENVIRONMENT Congress approved a bill to deal with nuclear waste but it failed to take action on a revision of the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act EDUCATION The Senate approved the Presidents proposal for tuition tax credits but the House took no action Congress rejected the Presidents proposal for further reductions in the Guaranteed Student Loan program and took no action on the Presidents proposal to replace the Department of Education with an independent Government foundation ENERGY Congress approved funds for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor It took no aciton on the Presidents plan to dismantle the Department of Energy and shift most of its reponsibilities to the Commerce Department AGRICULTURE Congress provided 32 billion for agriculture programs for the current fiscal year 9 billion more than sought by Mr Reagan The lawmakers forze price supports at existing levels but failed to complete action on a Payment in Kind proposal that would give farmers surplus commodities in addition to cash payments for not growing crops
ONE SIDE EFFECT OF BIRTH CONTROL IN CHINA: THE BRAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/25/world/one-side-effect-of-birth-control-in-china-the-brat.html,Chinas drive to hold down its population by restricting couples to one child has created an unintended side effect  the spoiled brat The problem was summed up by a Shanghai educator who recently told the Englishlanguage newspaper China Daily that single children are the sun in a family and parents and grandparents are planets orbiting the sun Chinese used to enjoy large extended families in which uncles aunts cousins older brothers and sisters all pitched in to teach a child how to behave But the traditional old structure is being altered by the limits that the state now imposes on family size Before you could say to your child Look at your brother look at your sister  lamented one father in Peking Now there is no one else for comparison China is trying desperately to keep its population to 12 billion by the year 2000 The nationwide census conducted last July disclosed that China already had 1008175288 citizens Hao Jianxiu the highestranking woman in the Communist Party Secretariat told a conference on family planning this week that Chinas annual population growth for the rest of the century must be held to 95 per 1000 to achieve the target New Campaign Next Month This is well below the 1455 per 1000 reported for 1981 or the 135 per 1000 estimated this year A new campaign is being mounted next month to promote the onechild family because a baby boom has been forecast over the next 15 years as those born in the 1960s before family planning was imposed get married According to Miss Hao who is also Minister of the Textile Industry it is estimated that 78 million young Chinese will be getting married over the next three years While birth control has been made virtually mandatory and sterilization is encouraged peasants prefer to have larger families to work the land now that new agricultural policies reward greater productivity A traditional preference for boys over girls remains persistent enough that it was denounced publicly by Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang at the National Peoples Congress this month New penalties promulgated recently in the northern province of Shanxi could be a harbinger of an even stricter national family planning policy Shanxi Daily reported that couples expecting a second child will now forfeit 20 percent of their salaries if the wife refuses to have an abortion If the second child is born the couple will lose 15 percent of their salaries until their second child turns 7 years old The penalties are stiffer for a third child Billboards in virtually every Chinese city extol the virtue of a onechild family often showing a healthy welldressed tot being caressed by beaming parents Such propaganda has evidently affected the selfesteem of children as have the rewards that the Government gives to cooperating parents including bonuses priority for housing and medical and educational benefits A letter to the newspaper Workers Daily from Sichuan Province complained that children without siblings went to the head of the line for inoculations at some hospitals In kindergarten such children sometimes were given more candy than their classmates and were allowed to go home while the others had to perform chores The letter said such practices sow dissension among children and add to the sense of superiority of only children The effect is also felt in big cities like Peking and Shanghai where only children already account for over half the kindergarten enrollments China Daily said Because they have no brothers and sisters some only children never learn to care for others When in kindergarten they quarrel with their friends and refuse to share their toys The problem is also apparent in higher grades We now get more and more only children said Yang Lijian the principal of the Shiyan Primary School in Shanghai They get a little spoiled by their parents so we have to teach them how to get along with other children Parents also lavish more presents on only children a Peking man said so the child grows up to expect such largesse China Daily cited a case in which a 5yearold in Shanghai refused to go to kindergarten until her mother left work to buy her a new scarf Cao Wenwen a physician at the Shanghai Childrens Hospital has reported a higher rate of obesity because many mothers were giving their babies candy and too much food Lu Lezhen a researcher at the Nanjing Normal College confirmed that some only children had developed poor eating habits because they would not eat nutritious food and always ask for chocolate or sugar in their porridge China Daily cited a survey made in Peking of 1741 children between 3 and 5 years old The survey reported that 29 percent of the only children had become fussy eaters But the survey also found that only children were cleverer more imaginative more creative more inquisitive and healthier than other children possibly because they received more attention And there is evidence that some parents do try to be conscientious about raising an only child correctly China Daily said that 32 books totaling 4 million copies had already been published on the subject of bringing up a single child And a special program aired by the Peking radio has resulted in a pamphlet on childrearing that has been distributed in 100000 copies Tang Hua who has a 6yearold daughter and who helped conduct the Peking survey told China Daily that other surveys in China had produced much the same results The point is to make parents stop doting on their little darlings Miss Tang said
ADDING UP THE LEGISLATIVE SCORECARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/26/weekinreview/adding-up-the-legislative-scorecard.html,WASHINGTON The second session of the 97th Congress passed much of its time on budget priorities at the expense of much substantive legislation The Senate held hostage by a stubborn conservative filibuster didnt leave until Thursday when it approved a gas taxhighway repair bill that had sailed through the House weeks ago The filibuster also delayed until last weekend passage of a stopgap funding bill laden with patronage baubles in the spirit of the season and the tradition of urgent spending bills All in all in the postelection session President Reagan requested so the 13 regular spending bills that provide money for Government operations could be passed Congress was able to approve only 7 A selection from the major issues the 97th Congress tackled follows Gas tax and highway repairs A Senate filibuster nearly killed a nickelagallon increase in the gasoline tax that will fund highway repairs and aid to mass transit The measure would create 320000 jobs  the principal reason for the enthusiasm of Congressional leaders of both parties They won a reluctant endorsement from President Reagan who until the end refused to call the bill a jobs creation measure Public works jobs A threatened Presidential veto persuaded both the House and Senate to abandon public works jobs programs attached to the stopgap funding bill The House measure would have provided 54 billion the Senate 12 billion MX Missile Perhaps partly in retaliation for the death of the jobs bill the stopgap conference committee rejected the Presidents plea for 988 million in production funds for the MX missile The House had deleted the funds but the Senate disagreed Budget and taxes Congress approved the largest deficit in history now estimated at more than 150 billion as part of a 769 billion budget for fiscal 1983 In an effort to reduce that deficit Congress approved a threeyear tax increase of 983 billion only a year after approving a tax cut that was the largest in history and a cornerstone of Reaganomics Foreign policy Congress approved the first part of the Presidents Caribbean Basin Initiative consisting of 350 million in emergency economic aid But the remainder of the program dealing with trade and tax benefits stayed stalled in the Senate Congressional leaders failed to bring up a separate foreign aid spending bill for fear that foreign aid would be cut at a time when domestic programs were and that Israel would be punished for its role in Lebanon Foreign aid funds were provided in the stopgap spending bill Congress also banned the use of funds against counterinsurgents in Nicaragua New federalism President Reagans plan to return Government programs and critics say more of the tax burden to the states was ignored Congress received the program in the form of a number of legislative proposals It included one to consolidate block grants most were rejected Education Congress ignored the Presidents plan to replace the Education Department with an independent Government foundation and rejected Mr Reagans proposal for further reductions in student loans Military spending Congress approved a 231 billion military budget the largest peacetime increase in the nations history A minor trim of 14 billion was made in the Presidents request Welfare The projected growth rates of food stamps Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Supplemental Security Income were cut but less than the President wanted Social issues Legislation to ban abortions and allow school prayer was killed by filibusters by Senate liberals while the House killed a Senatepassed bill that would have ended busing to achieve racial integration The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was extended Environment Congress failed to complete action on nuclear waste clean air or clean water legislation In the absence of new legislation the current law is continued to the chagrin of both environmentalists who want tighter control over polluters and those who seek a relaxation of Government regulations Immigration The Senate approved the first major revision of the immigration laws in 30 years but the House after lengthy debate took no action on the measure The law would grant permanent residency to millions of aliens presently residing here and penalize employers who hire illegal aliens It would also provide for issuance of identity cards which was anathema to some civil liberties organizations Regulation Legislation that would have made it more difficult for agencies to promulgate regulations and would require hearings and extensive records passed the Senate The House took no action Antitrust A threatened Senate filibuster blocked efforts that had been successful in the House to exempt physicians the National Football League and the shipping industry from the law Energy The Clinch River breeder reactor barely survived Congress ignored the Presidents plan to dismantle the Energy Department and shift most of its responsibilities to the Commerce Department Buy American The House passed a socalled domestic content bill that would require a percentage of automobiles sold in the United States to be manufactured in the United States The Senate did not consider the bill
RESTORING THE 'WILD' OF WILDERNESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/26/nyregion/restoring-the-wild-of-wilderness.html,NEWFOUNDLAND THE cage door swung open and the bobcat took off like a bullet bounding swiftly through the underbrush and over felled trees In what looked like one smooth effortless motion it scaled a 50foothigh rock formation and was gone The release of the 17pound female near a rockstrewn ridge in this heavily wooded section of Passaic County was part of the states continuing effort to restock wilderness areas with some of the animals that once were common Two smaller male kits had preceded the female that day a big male waited its turn in a cage on the back of a pickup truck Part of the charge of the Bureau of Wildlife Management is to maintain the density and diversity of wildlife species said Robert C Lund the bureaus principal wildlife biologist who engineered the release The bureau is an arm of the states Department of Environmental Protection Mountain lions and wolves were here once too he said looking out over the pine oak beech and mountain laurel Its too late for them now There is casual discussion from time to time ago about releasing wolves but the idea never gets past the reverie stage A proposal to restock the Pine Barrens with black bears became dormant after outcries from beekeepers and farmers However turkeys which were reintroduced several years ago are thriving And beavers are doing so well that an annual trapping season is declared to keep the population under control Peregrine falcons which hung on the brink of extinction and had not bred east of the Mississippi in decades are doing better in New Jersey than in any eastern state according to Melinda Welton a zoologist with the nongame species program operated by the Division of Fish Game and Wildlife The division like the bureau is part of the DEP The bobcats tagged and tattooed for future identification and inoculated against disease had been transported from central Maine The female and the sevenpound kits now are believed to be living near one of the reservoirs within the 30000acre Newark watershed They are among 21 of their kind that inhabit what is becoming bobcat country in the states northern mountainous reaches  the hills of Passaic and Sussex Counties between the Kittatinny Mountains to the west and Kanouse Mountain here The Bureau of Wildlife Management hopes that the cats will breed and grow to a population of 150 over the next several years Before the 1960s there had been hundreds of reports of bobcat sightings every year By the late 60s habitat destruction fur trapping and feline distemper had taken their toll and in the next decade none was sighted The states restoration program began in 1978 The bobcat has a limited home range 12 square miles on the average and is relatively easy to manage Mr Lund said Weve found that people enjoy their being around They enjoy seeing one in the wild and hunters report spotting them while out for deer A glimpse is all that hunters will be allowed according to Mr Lund and his assistant Daniel Ferrigno The small number of the species they said could never justify a hunting or trapping season I just dont think youll ever see it said James DeStephano vice president of the New Jersey Trappers Association Mr DeStephano who lives in Newfoundland chose the release site for the bobcats Its just nice to have them out there and I got a kick out of seeing them he said The male 6 to 7 years old was the biggest bobcat ever released  anabove average 3 feet long and weighing 33 poundsIt hissed and growled  a sound just shy of a roar  and bared its inchlong canine teeth at anyone who came near the cage Mr Lund and Mr Ferrigno freed it in Sussex County Bobcats so called because their short fiveinch tails appear to be bobbed are endangered in Indiana Iowa Ohio and Delaware Illinois lists the animal as threatened and it is nearly extinct in Kentucky Pennsylvania Rhode Island Maryland and Idaho An article by Hope Ryden a bobcat expert in Smithsonian magazine last year said Bobcats are most sparsely distributed across the Northern states and tragically it is there that they are most heavily exploited The bobcat the author said is vulnerable to the leghold trap because its feline nature compels it to investigate and play with a novel object Bobcat pelts bring as much as 650 apiece and it takes 11 of them to produce a fulllength fur coat Formidable predators they hunt cottontail rabbits squirrels voles mice and ground birds A hefty hungry bobcat can bringdown a deer They also have been known to make a meal of stray domestic cats now and then and are not above eating carrion when live prey is scarce But the secretive nocturnal animal officials say is terrified of humans and dogs and avoids both It is not likely then that the average person in town or a hiker would ever see a bobcat even at a distance Bobcat dens are in small caves on the sides of hills or beneath felled trees They are not conscientious homemakers Mr Lund said and move from den to den during their travels and from season to season While their home range in the Northeast is about 12 square miles bobcats have been known to claim as little as 25 square miles or as many as 42 depending upon geographical region One of them a male crossed the border up into New York and they found him 90 miles away  near Albany Mr Lund said Smaller than the lynx its close cousin the bobcat has reddish tan to brown fur with black or dark stripes or spots along its back Its ears are tufted and dark markings appear occasionally on the face The bobcats reproductive rate is low and according to some research it produces 28 embryos once a year There are no definite figures on rates of still births spontaneous abortions or newborn mortalities and so even this low birth rate is imprecise North American wildcats have sustained heavy losses according to the Smithsonian For example the jaguar is extinct the ocelot jaguarundi and margay are rare the cougar also known as the mountain lion is viable only in certain parts of the West and in Florida and the lynx is reported to be vanishing in New England and Wisconsin

G.O.P. MODERATES CALLED VITAL TO COALITION BEHIND REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/27/us/gop-moderates-called-vital-to-coalition-behind-reagan.html,The Reagan Administration must include traditional moderate Republican ideas to succeed according to a Brookings Institution magazine and recent Democratic gains are likely to increase strains within the Reagan coalition A James Reichley a senior fellow at the liberaltomoderate policy research organization wrote in The Brookings Review that President Reagan must avoid letting his Administration be limited by a rigid ideology Though his Administration has moved the direction of American government sharply to the right the President continues to stand on a broadly consistent program the Review out today said on its cover Now the job is to keep that program sufficiently wide and inclusive to maintain social harmony and achieve enduring political success Mr Reichleys accompanying article said that Republican moderates as well as the conservatives were an important boost to the election of Mr Reagan and to the accomplishments of the first two years of his Administration Divisions Could Worsen But diverse ideological political economic and geographical interests within the Reagan coalition could worsen the divisions in the next two years Mr Reichley said Republican losses in the House of Representatives in the 1982 elections will cause increased strains in some of these relationships he said Moderate Republicans he said supported Mr Reagans election and Administration for these reasons  They wanted to share in the luster of Mr Reagans popularity  Many were convinced that the wellbeing of their faction as well as the party was tied to Mr Reagans success  They generally agreed with the Presidents efforts to reduce government intervention though he often carried these beyond what they would have preferred Social Issues Disputed Differences opened up in 1982 mostly on social issues where the moderates were more concerned with civil liberties aspects of the abortion school prayer and busing disputes Mr Reichley said At the same time conservatives objected to Mr Reagans acceptance of tax increases and his cautious approach to the Soviet Union But the United States is so diverse a country that a party or an Administration tightly limited by rigid ideology could hardly survive let alone govern effectively he said The President is quite right to stand on a broadly consistent program and to ask that his Administration be judged on the validity of its governmental principles as well as on operational efficiency Mr Reichley concluded The trick is to keep that program sufficiently wide and inclusive to maintain general social harmony and achieve enduring political success

RUSSIANS COLLECT ARGOT FROM THE LOWER DEPTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/28/books/russians-collect-argot-from-the-lower-depths.html,WHEN Kirill Uspensky a Russian writer began a fiveyear term in a Soviet labor camp in 1960 he was surprised to find that he often did not understand the evidently Russian language of his fellow prisoners Some of these camp inmates were ordinary criminals such as murderers and thieves But others such as Mr Uspensky himself were in the camp for political reasons they were dissident scientists writers and artists people who had once been in the most honored and responsible positions in the country and whose Russian should have been perfect Mr Uspenskys inability to comprehend the common speech of both types of inmates led him to a monumental task that morethan two decades later he is near finishing in the United States Mr Uspensky a former military officer who managed to immigrate to this country in 1979 and is now an associate of the Russian Research Center at Harvard is compiling a massive dictionary of nenormativnaya leksika or what he calls unconventional Russian the inventive pungent ironyladen vernacular of unofficial Soviet life For most languages in most countries that would be an ambitious but innocuous scholarly undertaking A dozen major works on American slang have appeared in the last decade alone in this country for example Has a Political Dimension But Mr Uspenskys work on Russian slang takes on an important political dimension No comprehensive dictionary of unconventional usage has ever been published in the Soviet Union apparently because Russian slang  like that of other languages derives not just from the patter of everyday life but from what can fairly be described as the shadows of society it is the semiclandestine language of criminals and dissidents alike the lexicon of unconventional mores and ideas that have been accorded no official existence in the Soviet Union In this sense Mr Uspenskys dictionary mirrors aspects of Soviet society that have generally been the subject of dissident writings published as Mr Uspenskys dictionary will be abroad While he began with the language of criminals and the labor camps Mr Uspensky has also collected the technical jargon of professional groups the slang of prostitutes the code words and phrases of teenagers the bittersweet linguistic inventions of intellectuals as they face the might of political repression What may well be of most interest in the West is the powerful streak of popular skepticism about the claims of socialism that emerges from the language of the street In vernacular speech there are a lot of expressions that are in themselves extremely critical of aspects of Soviet life Mr Uspensky said Street Russian for example is full of jaded commentary on the Soviet system The special apartment houses built for party leaders are mockingly called houses of the village poor A membership card in the Communist Party is a ration card reflecting the privileged access to supplies that Party members have in shortageprone Soviet society The bust of Karl Marx in central Moscow is commonly known as the scarecrow A host of words and phrases refers ruefully to the KGB the security police Gregory Borisovich a kind of Russian John Doe is a common name for a KGB agent as is the term the hairy ear KGB jazz is a name given to jammed radio broadcasts from abroad The third ear refers to someone who listens to bugged conversations In all Mr Uspensky has compiled some 50000 entries showing this politically loaded terminology and many other slang usages Eventually they will be printed in three volumes totaling about 2500 pages They include the idiom of criminals and bureaucrats of such occupational groups as sailors carpenters and actors and of such diverse subgroups as black marketeers alcoholics and drug addicts They contain technical jargon  in military usage for example the term little fish means a blip on a radar screen  and the earthy obscene argot of the streets Other Volumes Planned Mr Uspenskys work when finished will consist of a dictionary entirely in Russian that he hopes will be off the press in about a year and a half although the publisher has yet to be determined Fluent in English he plans in about three years to complete a companion volume of some 5000 to 6000 items of unconventional Russian usage translated into English this volume he said will be far more comprehensive than Soviet Prison Camp Speech a Survivors Glossary compiled by Meyer Galler and Harlan E Marquess and published in this country in 1972 Some examples cited and translated into English by Mr Uspensky show how unconventional Russian ranges from the idioms common in any society to terms revealing the special nature of Soviet life The most common source of idioms is in the jargon of criminals and was absorbed by other groups who spent time in the labor camps for political reasons To throw away your hooves is one of the many phrases meaning to die Information given to the police by an informer is a knock the word informer itself has some 30 to 50 slang equivalents says Mr Uspensky including shedog snake whore and the word Seksot a contraction of the two Russian words for secret collaborator Full of Coarse Irony The slang that emerges from Mr Uspenskys research often displays a powerful quality of coarse irony For women for example Ivan the Terrible is a name given to the standard gynecological examining table and derives Mr Uspensky says from the roughness of treatment at state medical institutions For much the same reason an abortion is a scratch The term May Day the holiday when red flags appear everywhere is used sardonically by Russian women to mean the onset of menstruation There are also numerous expressions deriving from the imprisonment of dissidents in psychiatric hospitals in the Soviet Union The word doghouse is used for the ward where violent patients are put The psychodrome is the exercise yard Mr Uspensky is uniquely qualified for his lexicographic project Born in 1915 in Petrograd  the present Leningrad  he spent 12 years in the Red Army including service as an intelligence officer in World War II He had a foretaste of police terror in 1938 when he was arrested by NKVD police accused of being a German spy beaten unconscious and then just as abruptly released In Four Separate Camps By 1960 established as a writer in Leningrad Mr Uspensky was arrested again and sentenced to a fiveyear term for antiSoviet activity He served four years of that term in four separate labor camps in the Mordovian Autonomous Republic all of them maximumsecurity prisons with barbed wire watchtowers armed guards and electronic tripwires to deter wouldbe escapees Still Mr Uspensky says that he was lucky to have experienced the labor camps at a relatively liberal time when unlike today prisoners were allowed books and could engage in their own literary projects On his release from the camp Mr Uspensky took with him 14000 note cards on which he had recorded prison argot He continued his work at home in Leningrad reading and interviewing and above all expanding the scope of his research beyond the language of the criminal world Fearful that his files might be discovered by the police he photographed them and with the help of an American friend smuggled the film to the United States By 1978 Mr Uspensky says the police had searched his home twice Luckily they didnt come across my card files Once he was verbally assaulted on the streets by three men who he assumed were KGB agents My work he says had become the goal of my life I had to leave the country in order to save it Obtained a Jewish Passport Mr Uspensky who wrote in the Soviet Union under the pen name Kirill Kostsinsky applied for emigration claiming falsely that he was Jewish At that time large numbers of Jews were being allowed to leave the Soviet Union In any case he said referring to the Soviet authorities they wanted to get rid of me Permission to emigrate came in only 10 days Mr Uspensky contends ironically that to have been a labor camp inmate was in the end a rewarding experience To gain something out of that extremely hard life you have to have guts of course he said  When I found myself in the camp I tried to get maximum use of it for myself And in a way I did It will seem rather funny he added but when I prepare the manuscript for publication I will thank the KGB for giving me the possibility to peep into that strange and until then for me unknown world
A Governor for Hard Winters,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/30/opinion/a-governor-for-hard-winters.html,Though he sometimes seemed to be trying to hide them Hugh Leo Careys great qualities soon became obvious to the people of his state probably because he reached Albany when the economic climate was icy and New York Citys future cheerless The people found in him inspiration in adversity ingenuity in answering challenges that aroused his spirit mastery of subjects that stirred his interest charm wit and undaunted courage They also came to recognize less heroic traits impatience with critics excessive stubbornness in negotiations vanity that occasionally towered over pride He comforted his detractors by using state airplanes for family errands and invoking the power of eminent domain to prevent a neighbor from building a home on his own property by frequently escaping the Albany vapors in alltoofashionable discotheques by tinting his greying hair as often as a peacock drops feathers In contrast to Nelson Rockefellers imperial solicitude for his appointees Hugh Carey often seemed to be protecting himself against his own sentimentality He was rough on his aides and closest associates and wore out many of them The stir of ambition could often be observed within him and caused many to wonder which political attachments would next be sacrified to the search for something greater or merely grander Yet Governor Careys shortcomings were dwarfed by his stature as leader his weight of character He brought greatness to the office He deserves much of the credit for saving New York City from bankruptcy Though many contributed to that achievement Hugh Carey brought them all together made their solutions practical and sustained their faith that state and city financial problems could be solved He then turned his attention to the states declining economy and forced on it the recognition of limited resources of the importance of attracting new businesses and expanding existing ones Though committed to Democratic traditions of social justice he made his party recognize that the state could not distribute wealth without also promoting its creation Governor Carey established the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the Emergency Financial Control Board to make New York Citys accounting methods acceptable to banks He saved the Urban Development Corporation by persuading the Legislature to establish the Project Finance Agency that absorbed many of its liabilities He restructured the Battery Park City Authority so it could take advantage of a fortuitous shift in the real estate market and proceed with longstalled plans He contained hospital costs He put the Metropolitan Transportation Authority into the strongest hands it has ever had If Mr Carey has sometimes been quicker to credit help from outside political life than from fellow politicians that is a characteristic of elected officials Less characteristically he was one who could change his mind when situations changed and who when the political storms were coldest lost neither energy nor courage Yet he never wavered where he thought he saw a moral imperative as in his opposition to capital punishment and support for government funding for poor womens abortions As Hugh Careys eight years as Governor dwindle down to their last hours it is hard to imagine how anyone else could have done so well in leading the state through its hardest winter
"CAREY ENDS 8 YEARS IN OFFICE, HIS RECORD A MIX OF CONTRASTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/31/nyregion/carey-ends-8-years-in-office-his-record-a-mix-of-contrasts.html,Governor Carey leaves office today his record a mix of impressive success and puzzling lapses and his place in New York States history still uncertain As he has through most of his eight years in office Hugh L Carey still stirs strong passion Admirers talk in heroic terms about the crisis manager who saved New York City from bankruptcy and led the state in a difficult new era of austerity and retrenchment Detractors remember the brooding and inaccessible loner who had trouble maintaining ties with friends subordinates or legislators Assesments of his administration gathered from a spectrum of experts both within and outside of the state government are mixed and not particulalry along partisan lines A Feeling of Disappointment People who have worked with him often expressed sadness and frustration that Mr Carey even with his successes did not attain what they believe a man of his intelligence and depth could have achieved Carey was good said his successor Mario M Cuomo who takes office tomorrow But he had a lot of limitations He could have left a much bigger imprint on the region and the country said Felix G Rohatyn one of Mr Careys top advisers on fiscal issues The things he did he did very well He certainly had the qualities to be a standout if he had handled them better said former Mayor Abraham D Beame Mr Carey himself says he worries that the substantive accomplishments of his two terms in office will be obscured by a focus on sometimes quirky personal traits He mentioned in particular his offer to drink a glass of toxic waste to prove that a state building was safe and his battle to stop a dentist from building a house next to his on Shelter Island Ive proven to myself I can govern this state Mr Carey said in an interview Wednesday The objectives I set forth Ive achieved in terms of a state thats respected fiscally a city thats now well on its way back to concrete foundations Any place I look our institutions are working Admirers and even critics find great strengths in Mr Carey He is as smart as anyone in politics they say and he has a gift for clarifying issues and getting to the heart of problems He has this great talent of stating problems very succinctly and precisely said Manfred Ohrenstein the leader of the Democratic minority in the State Senate and a persistent critic He was always able to distill the public issues into very simple terms Execution was sometimes the problem What he contributed was the sense of stating the issue said Senator Ohrenstein What he couldnt do was take the issues that he stated and get them resolved Pledge of No Corruption Hugh Leo Carey a littleknown Representative from Brooklyn took office in Albany in the midst of the nations greatest political scandal on the very day in fact when John N Mitchell HR Haldeman John D Ehrlichman and Robert C Mardian were convicted in the Watergate coverup trial In his inaugural address on that day Jan 1 1975 Mr Carey promised that his government would be free of corruption By all accounts he lived up to that pledge He was intellectually honest too say both friends and foes and he stood by positions that were not necessarily popular such as his opposition to the death penalty and his support of government financing of abortions for poor women Mr Carey himself cites as accomplishments an improvement in the court system particularly juvenile justice the maintaining of calm in state prisons despite a sharp rise in inmate population and an upgrading of the image of the states economy But Mr Carey was also the first governor in a century to have a veto overridden by the Legislature In his second term the process of putting together a budget with the Legislature was transformed into a monthslong agony that helped undermine the states credit rating Problems With Legislators Legislators said they found the Governor aloof and inaccessible The Governor in turn viewed them as petty and consumed by local interests Mistrust and recrimination became the norm in his relationship with legislative leaders Governor I dont understand you Senator Ohrenstein said to Mr Carey just a few days ago in one of their final meetings to discuss legislation Thats because Im being straight with you Fred Mr Carey replied You might not expect him to have had a good relationship with us said Warren M Anderson leader of the Republican majority in the State Senate But he never had really a good relationship with his own party Some of these problems would no doubt have occurred under any governor suggested Stanley Fink Speaker of the Assembly The Legislature was politically divided the Senate under Republican control the Assembly dominated by the Democrats It is one of only four such split legislatures in the country An Independent Legislature In eight years Ive had one house in opposition said Mr Carey and the other house in you might say independence This independence in both houses was stoked by a postWatergate breed of legislator  younger more issueoriented and more independent than their predeccessors That was just one of the changes Mr Carey had to cope with Any assessment of Mr Carey must view him against the times in which he governed He took office virtually in the shadow of one of this states most dominant modern political figures  Nelson A Rockefeller who served 15 years as Governor during an expansive time that allowed him to leave a legacy of buildings roads and schools Mr Careys times were different We wont erect monuments to men he said the other day Richard C Wade a professor of history at the City University of New York and a longtime Democratic Party activist says Mr Carey should be viewed as the first of the modern American governors who had to operate in a new era of shrinking state government Expression of Situation in 1975 The Governors widely admired skill at summarizing issues was probably never illustrated better than in his first few days in office when he announced The days of wine and roses are over Mr Carey cut both taxes and budgets in Professor Wades view while preserving the traditional Democratic commitment to social programs I would like to be remembered as somebody who cared a great deal about people Mr Carey said at his farewell news conference Wednesday There isnt any doubt it was more difficult to be a governor in the 70s than in the 60s said Senator Anderson You can only get into the history books by building something or organizing something and that was difficult Views on Governors Legacy One Carey aide suggested that if Nelson Rockefellers legacy was the State University Hugh Careys is a balanced state budget Indeed if there is one issue that Mr Carey would like to be remembered for he said Wednesday it was organizing the rescue of New York City when it hovered near default in 1975 He saved the city and the state in 1975 said Mayor Koch who was a member of the House at the time If the city had gone down the state would have been two days behind He did it by bringing together the best minds and making everyone work together He harnessed people who were used to running on separate tracks The complex rescue package included concessions from unions a Financial Control Board to reassure the bankers and a Municipal Assitance Corporation to raise funds for the city Many of the people Mr Carey called on at that time remain active in government and it appears may continue to be after he is gone These include Mr Rohatyn the chairman of the Municipal Assitance Corporation and Richard Ravitch now chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Criticism in a Minority He gave me an enormous amount of public credit said Mr Rohatyn when it would have been very easy for him to take it But even in what virtually everyone views as Mr Careys brightest hour there is a chorus of criticism although clearly a minority on this question When push came to shove on the fiscal crisis he did the right thing said one official who worked with him But when push came to shove there was no choice but to do the right thing The only reason he was able to perform so well in the fiscal crisis was that he had no choice said Senator Ohrenstein Mr Beame who was Mayor at the time and was defeated for reelection in part because Mr Carey opposed him said During our trying period we didnt get the financial help from the state What we got were some tools We got the power to tax ourselves The hard decisions had to be made by us We went through the harrowing experience Nobody else did Some Say He Seemed Bored Perhaps the hardest thing about the fiscal crisis for Mr Carey was that everything after it seemed to pale by comparison Associates say he often seemed bored The end of his first term was dominated by his comefrombehind reelection victory a victory in which credit must be spread between his own campaigning and the weakness of his Republican opponent Perry B Duryea But in his second term the administration seemed to drift at times and much public attention focused on personal issues There is a consensus among supporters and critics that history will not long remember some of these issues that so captured public attention during Mr Careys second term They ranged from the constantly shifting color of his graying hair to his spectacular marriage to Evangeline Gouletas who it turned out had concealed details of three marriages from the public and apparently from the Governor as well Mr Carey has complained that the press made more of these events than was appropriate But some of them were also a reflection of an underlying problem in the view of people who worked with him Seen as at Best in a Crisis When he focuses and buckles down to a problem hes effective said Senator Anderson I dont know why he doesnt do it more uniformly He almost seemed to need a crisis to motivate him Sometimes it seemed Mr Carey made trouble just to keep things interesting Hes a man who enjoys swimming at the tops of waves hes created by his own turbulence said Mr Cuomo There were persistent complaints that Mr Carey had delegated too much authority to his staff and would not talk to his commissioners  charges that Mr Carey insisted did not take account of his effort to stay above the daily fray During his detachment as he described it I found some answers to some very difficult problems He said he worried now that his record was not well enough understood and that he might have been hurt by a determination not to blame others for problems he had to wrestle with If people dont realize how much I love this state then I didnt get my message across said Mr Carey If I didnt get my message across it is my own fault

RELIGIOUS LEADERS FEAR DISPUTE'S EFFECT ON TIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/02/world/religious-leaders-fear-dispute-s-effect-on-ties.html,The controversy surrounding the trip to Israel by John Cardinal OConnor is being viewed with deep concern by American religious figures who have labored in the last two decades in the field of Roman CatholicJewish relations At the same time they have sought to put the OConnor trip in perspective noting that a great stride was made in relations between Catholics and Jews when Pope John Paul II visited a synagogue in Rome last April The controversy arose when the Cardinal under Vatican pressure canceled meetings he had arranged with several highranking Israeli officials The Vatican has indicated it objects principally to the idea that the Cardinal was to hold the meetings in Jerusalem which it does not recognize as Israels capital The Vatican like almost all countries does not recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital Lester Pollack president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York said The unscheduling of sessions with highlevel Goverment officials in Jeruslaem after going ahead with meetings with Jordans King and other officials in Amman signals a critical setback in the process of advancing understanding between the two faith groups Relationship Called Sound Other Catholic and Jewish leaders echoed Mr Pollacks statement but preferred to emphasize that the relationship between American Catholics and Jews was a sound one that would survive this setback Our discussions cant stop and wont stop said Eugene J Fisher executive secretary of the Secretariat for CatholicJewish Relations at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops The Vaticans refusal to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel or to acknowledge its sovereignty over Jersusalem has been central to the interfaith talks Other issues broached in CatholicJewish exchanges have been abortion parochial school aid and educational matters such as the setting up of Holocaust curriculums and joint education programs for seminarians Russell Shaw a spokesman for the national bishops group which represents the 300 American prelates said it was sometimes difficult for nonJews to understand the significance of Israel to Jews By the same token he said there is a lack of appreciation on the Jewish side for the essentially benevolent policy that the Vatican is trying to play in the Middle East Mr Fisher said the OConnor trip underlined the need for more discussion but he declined to call the incident a setback It certainly is not a step forward he added A Blip in the Progress Morris B Abram chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations called the OConnor incident a blip in what he said has been a growing understanding between Jews and Catholics particularly in the United States He noted that last year Catholics and Jews celebrated the 20th anniversary of Nostra Aetate the declaration of the Second Vatican Council which deplored antiSemitism and marked the beginning of a new openness between Catholics and Jews We never see progress without a blip Mr Abram said And this is a blip What is fundamental is that for the first time in 1900 years a Pope visited a synagogue What is fundamental is that the church says that the death of Jesus cannot be blamed on Jews in our times What is fundamental is that Cardinal OConnor joins us in New York in demonstrations to free Soviet Jewry The Rev Michael McGarry the rector of Saint Pauls College in Washington stressed that it was important that exchanges between American Catholics and Jews should continue because they could ultimately influence Vatican policy on Israel If there is any chance for change in the Vatican view regarding Israel it is going to come from the United States said Father McGarry who recently spent a year at Hebrew University in Jersualem and favors full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican No LongTerm Effect Seen He said that the case of Cardinal OConnor who is generally perceived as a conservative in the church could be seen as another example of Romes trying to assert control over American Catholic bishops in the manner that Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle was disciplined last year for liberal policies I wonder if the Vatican feels that United States Catholics have been too aggressive in CatholicJewish relations Father McGarry said Maybe this would be one more example of them saying Hey slow down a minute we have a wider view of this  Rabbi Alexander M Schindler president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations a Reform group that has emphasized discussions with Catholics said he did not expect the OConnor trip to have a longterm effect on CatholicJewish relations He said the Jewish organizations were aware that there were elements in the Catholic world that were unfriendly to Israel I think our good relations are strongest on the American scene he said adding that the American bishops are having their own problems with the Vatican Rabbi Binyamin Walfish the executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America an Orthodox group that engages in talks with Catholics on social issues but not on theological matters said the OConnor trip was a lesson in the limits of CatholicJewish dialogue We have to be more realistic about our relations with the church and realize that they have theological and religious considerations that supercede their relationship with the Jewish community and Israel he said Cardinal OConnor has explained that he canceled appointments with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel and President Chaim Herzog at the direction of the Vatican Several leading Catholics and Jews said they were baffled by the sudden change in plans which came just before the Cardinal left for the Middle East on Saturday Rabbis Remarks Noted One theory  given credence in recent days by Mayor Koch and by an article in The Jerusalem Post  was that Vatican officials were concerned about a report in The New York Times on Dec 22 that quoted Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum on the Cardinals plans Rabbi Tanenbaum the international relations director for the American Jewish Committee said Cardinal OConnor hoped to make peace in the Middle East a central concern of his ministry In a statement Tuesday Dr David M Gordis executive vice president of the committee denied charges that the disclosure of the Cardinals plans touched off the Vatican action The curtailment of Cardinal OConnors schedule originated in the Vatican and not in New York Dr Gordis said While some are trying to use Rabbi Tanenbaums comments as a pretext Dr Gordis said the responsibility for transforming what might have been a contribution to reconciliation and friendship into an embarrassment and humiliation lies squarely with those in the Vatican who for their own reasons have chosen this course In another development Dr M T Mehdi secretary general of the National Council on Islamic Affairs praised the Vatican for curtailing Cardinal OConnors schedule As American Moslems we are grateful that there is the Vatican which opposes on moral grounds the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem and other Palestinian lands he said Dr Mehdi noted that several leading American Jews had called on Cardinal OConnor not to go through with his trip if he could not meet with Israeli officials Dr Mehdi said that in part he concurred We agree with the Jewish groups that possibly the Cardinal should cancel his visit to Israel He will then be strengthening his moral opposition to that garrison state
TEACHING BASIC SKILLS TERMED SCHOOLS' ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/nyregion/l-teaching-basic-skills-termed-schools-role-180087.html,I read with interest the Dec 14 Opinion Page article by Susan N Wilson wherein she called for mandatory sex education in the schools She maintains that by doing so we will be providing a service that addresses the growing problem of teenage pregnancies abortions AIDS etc Although Ms Wilson is wellintentioned I suspect that her ideas will not resolve the problem in the areas cited not because young people are ignorant but because of the destruction of longheld and nowdiscarded moral values Ms Wilson seems to think that the answer lies in teaching children as young as the kindergarten level about all manner of heterosexual and homosexual activities and the precautions necessary to guarantee safety from disease The function of our school system should be to teach basic skills eg the three Rs and good citizenship Social services and sex education are not the answers to a very complex problem that has a rather simple solution if only parents teachers religious leaders and social planners had either the brains or the guts to implement it And that is that promiscuity and Great Society social programs have been a dismal failure On another note one must ask why was it necessary for Ms Wilson to identify the New Jersey Catholic Conference in her article There is no question but that kicking the Catholic Church is a popular participatory sport of people on the left The family is the basic unit of society It would seem that the purpose of this latest necessary program is to break up families before they have a chance to form ANDREW J MAC DONALD Fanwood
THE SILVER-GRAY SOUL OF ULRICH VOGTMANN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/books/the-silver-gray-soul-of-ulrich-vogtmann.html,WINNER TAKES ALL By Dieter Wellershoff Translated by Paul Knight 388 pp New York Carcanet 1695 DIETER WELLERSHOFFs hero Ulrich Vogtmann orphaned during World War II attains manhood in postwar West Germany with no sense of direction and the conviction that I am nobody The closest he comes to inspiration is a university lecture that he attends by chance and that leaves him convinced money is the lifestuff of the imagination    the universal machine which set all other machines in motion    the metabolism of society Through a friend he gets a job at a dairyproduct factory owned and run by one Hermann Pattberg Pattberg who holds his position by inheritance is unambitious and only marginally competent and Vogtmann quickly drifts rather than drives his way to the job of managing director having meanwhile entered a loveless marriage with the bosss daughter Elisabeth after breaking off an affair with an older Yugoslav woman at the very moment she has a messy abortion Thereafter Vogtmanns life is an unmitigated disaster in both commercial and human terms Gambling to expand the business he buys a supermarket chain based in Munich only to discover that he has been taken in the transaction He tries to recoup with a second more desperate deal with a promoter of questionable repute  an investment of 14 million marks in heavily discounted bills of exchange secured by a quantity of deadly poison pills intended as insecticide for use in Zaire Vogtmanns marriage deteriorates his alcoholic brotherinlaw tries to kill him and then commits suicide his son becomes a shoplifter and writes NO FUTURE in huge letters on the main building of the school he attends and Vogtmann carries on a listless affair with a frivolous woman in Munich When political unrest in Zaire makes the bills of exchange worthless the Pattberg firm is ruined and the story moves to its predictable conclusion Through this gloomy narrative we spend a lot of time with Vogtmann in hotel rooms on superhighways in his silvergray Mercedes and at business and businesssocial meetings Many weather fronts pass over West Germany and the storms they bring are duly recorded Where American novels of business are apt to glitter with ingenious technical detail but are weak on character and description this one focuses on the true material of fiction and properly keeps information on commercial method in the background The reader ends with the feeling of having been with Vogtmann perhaps even of having been Vogtmann for a time But the feeling is depressing One is reminded not as the publisher hopes of Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks but rather of Zola Mr Wellershoff a West German novelist essayist and dramatist who has been rendered here in a readable translation by Paul Knight offers effective descriptions of furniture and mood and squalor in this case the squalor not of poverty but of affluence as well as rather heavyhanded symbolism Vogtmann who literally deformed his feet by wearing tootight shoes in his youth has deformed his adult soul by making a god of money But in literary art if not in life Zolas time has gone and the poetry even Zola managed is missing here Sociologically this is surely the dark side of Germanys economic miracle while West Germany rose with Western aid from the ashes of war to world leadership greedy empty men were destroying themselves and all they touched there as elsewhere The fact that Winner Takes All was a best seller in West Germany suggests that Vogtmanns story has a contemporary resonance in that country
COLD DAYS ARE BACK IN RUMANIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/world/cold-days-are-back-in-rumania.html,With winter hard upon them Rumanians are once again experiencing the drastic energy shortage that has made them shiver in barely heated and dimly lighted homes and workplaces through the last two winters even more so than in the winters before Shortages of all foods in a country that is a traditional food exporter result in a dominant impression of a nation perennially standing in line with empty shopping bags and returning home with the bags scarcely fuller Meanwhile the tributes paid to the leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena the countrys second most powerful person still require of Rumanians gestures of enthusiastic approval that contrast to the hardships of more than 21 years of Mr Ceausescus rule In the eyes of Rumanians who take the risk of taking visitors or foreign diplomats into their confidence the daily hardships and stern constraints on liberties dim the achievement for which Mr Ceausescu is best known abroad  a foreign policy somewhat independent of the Soviet Unions Cutting the Military A special plebiscite in November typified both aspects of Mr Ceausescus absolute rule As the Soviet Union raised its military spending by 6 percent he announced that he was cutting Rumanias armed forces their equipment and budget by 5 percent Then he ordered a plebiscite to approve his decision Rumanians reported to their jobs on a Sunday the only day off from their 46hour work week and voted yes unanimously according to the Governments report Children from age 14 voted in school as Mr Ceausescu lowered the voting age for the occasion Because they were already at their machines or desks most were told to put in a regular workday Of a nation of more than 22 million with 177 million eligible voters all but 228 people voted and all votes were in favor the Government said In the propaganda campaign before the voting Mr Ceausescus image was even more in evidence than usual His words were inscribed on many walls and his name dominated the two hours of television a day that are allowed during the power shortage Plans Fulfilled Goods Short Rumanian newspapers do not report on the shortages A foreign reporter was told at the Ministries of Petroleum Extraction and Food Industry that the ministries had no explanation for the shortages Both ministries are said to have fulfilled or surpassed their production plans which provide for the needs of all Rumanians A director at the Food Ministry Ion Ruianu denied that there were shortages He said there might be occasional brief shortcomings in distribution Asked about the food lines which begin before dawn and continue into dark in Bucharest and several provincial cities Mr Ruianu replied We consider that this is only an appearance because the statistical data show that the consumption of agricultural and food products increased every year in accordance with the needs of the populations He said surplus products were exported only after all domestic needs were met But a senior Government economist who spoke anonymously said that life would continue to be difficult for at least five years and that export production would remain the top priority during that period Unlike other Communist leaders Mr Ceausescu has made repayment of the foreign debt a result of costly and unproductive industrial investment in his early years in power an overriding goal Since 1982 he has approximately halved a debt estimated at its peak at 14 billion The cost of this success has been disregard of basic consumer needs Meat and dairy products have virtually disappeared from family tables Asked about the fact that the same people are often seen in line mornings and evenings Mr Ruianu said they were hoarding This brought bitter laughs from consumers A woman said her family bought at best a couple of pounds of bones the most frequently available product in the butcher shops If the family is lucky she said the bones were of the better of two categories with scraps of meat on them The other kind is shiny she said The average wage is less than 3000 lei a month At the official rate this is 300 The realistic rate is about onesixth of that the rate offered by the blackmarket currency dealers A Pound of Meat a Month In Cluj the main city of Transylvania consumers reported a monthly meat ration of one pound Gavril Groza president of the county executive sidestepped all questions on the availability of food Consumers reported that bread sugar cooking oil and flour were rationed but that the small amounts of the rations were not always available Cheese and butter had become almost unknown a woman reported Such former staples as Rumanian ham canned meats and cheese are seen only in hardcurrency shops for foreigners A saleswoman said flour sugar and oil were also occasionally available for foreign currency which Rumanians are forbidden to have A result is that throughout the cities foreign students mainly Arabs and Africans buy most of the Rumanian products that Rumanians may not buy with the money they earn then resell them to Rumanians at great profit A working woman with a 9yearold child said she could feed her family only with the help of her elderly mother who stands in lines while her daughter is at work Campaign for More Children Despite the food shortages Rumania is stepping up its longstanding campaign to encourage women to have more children For years contraceptives and abortions have been unavailable and illegal As a result illegal abortions have caused many deaths The Government has stepped up obligatory monthly medical checks of women at their workplaces to detect pregnancies and keep them from being interrupted Diplomats have received reports of implicit encouragement to schoolgirls to produce children out of wedlock Although minimal electricity is expended to heat houses and workplaces no energy is being spared on an ever more grandiose project to devastate the center of the capital and construct a vast avenue with Government palaces and apartment buildings to mark what is officially called the Ceausescu Epoch the Age of Gold The only public grumbling heard by a visitor in 15 days came from an old woman bemoaning the vanishing of the old town with its traditional houses churches and synagogues It has earned for Mr Ceausescu the honorific of Hero of Agriculture as one joke has it for plowing up the entire center of Bucharest
The Facts of Life of Teen Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/10/opinion/the-facts-of-life-of-teen-pregnancy.html,We were asked to look at information and the facts said Dr Daniel D Federman of Harvard Medical school who headed a National Research Council panel on teenage pregnancy The facts the group found are appalling  fully justifying an aggressive birth control campaign for youngsters For example more than a million American teenagers get pregnant each year About 400000 of them will have abortions and a substantial number will miscarry The 470000 who do give birth will probably drop out of school earn less than half than do those who become mothers in their 20s and go on welfare Their children are apt to have physical and development problems and to give birth as teenagers themselves In 1985 those young families cost the Federal Government 166 billion in welfare Medicaid and food stamps And they pay the highest price  in lost opportunities Most Americans would agree that those facts add up to a national tragedy But unlike other national tragedies  an epidemic say  this one doesnt evoke a common response Precocious sexuality and its consequences constitute too awkward a subject for dispassionate discourse The National Research Council panel therefore deserves praise for its refusal to be intimidated by controversy Sexually active teenagers both boys and girls it argues need the ability to avoid pregnancy and the motivation to do so Condoms it suggests should be widely distributed where teenage boys congregate New methods for distributing the pill which it characterizes as the safest and most effective contraceptive should be explored As for the argument heard recently in New York City that easy access to birth control provokes early sexual activity the panel says theres no evidence for it  and endorses further trials of schoolbased contraceptive clinics Persuading youngsters to delay sexual activity would reduce adolescent pregnancy  but thats wishful America knows little about how to effect such a delay According to a new Planned Parenthood survey more than half the nations teenagers say theyve had intercourse by the age of 17 Yet only a third use birth control regularly The new survey also reinforces the panels observation that teenagers must be motivated to avoid pregnancy The kids objectively who have the most to lose the most at stake said Michael Kagay chief analyst use birth control more These the survey found include young people who have career aspirations get good grades and are involved in sports or extracurricular activities The girl who has a baby at 15 or 16 has set herself a hard path and her child a harder one Meanwhile America while battling over her plight refuses to face it The panel has and deserves the widest hearing
THE YANKEE DEVILS!,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/11/books/the-yankee-devils.html,THE ALLEY CAT By Yves Beauchemin Translated by Sheila Fischman 450 pp New York Henry Holt  Company 1795 EVER since that September morning in 1759 when Montcalms troops marched from Quebec City directly toward the British guns and in 30 minutes of glorious stupidity ended 150 years of French colonial dreams in Canada a certain grumpiness has colored the French Canadian view of the nonFrenchspeaking world That grumpiness is a cornerstone and I think a fundamental flaw of Yves Beauchemins novel The Alley Cat In broad outline The Alley Cat is an urban picaresque recounting the struggle of the decent that is Quebecois and countercultural Florent Boissonneault against the wicked and powerful Egon Ratablavasky a foreigner who speaks very bad French and desperately needs a fresh pair of socks Backed by Ratablavasky who at first appears his benefactor  Florent buys a restaurant with his Anglo friend Slipskin Before he knows it the Anglo and the Eastern European have drugged him and stolen his restaurant Over the next 350 pages we follow Florents efforts aided by a splendid cast of French Canadian cohorts including a hottempered chef Picquot and an alcoholic child Emile to take his revenge This is a promising comic situation one giving French Canadians plenty of opportunity to strike witty blows at objects of their xenophobia Thus the wildly choleric chef denounces Americans Picquot rounded off the evening with a lengthy diatribe against instant mashed potatoes canned fruit the systematic use of processed foods and all the culinary disasters that had devastated the Western world since the Americans had decided to plant their flag in our plates Those pigs he thundered are sapping our civilization and transforming all of France into a pitiful shameful base supermarket He stopped scarlet and gasping dulleyed and uncertain where he was But prejudice is funny only when its undercut by this kind of ludicrous exaggeration Unfortunately Mr Beauchemin a Quebecois writer with one previous novel to his credit displays prejudices and hostilities so deep his novel is more often bleak and portentous His biases which include a bitterness toward capitalism and a reverence for countercultural values undercut the novels picaresque scheme The Frenchspeaking and the poor are so regularly virtuous and AngloCanadians and Americans are so regularly scum that much of the books capacity for surprise is sacrificed making it seem less inventive and varied than it actually is Does an American doctor seem sympathetic Not to worry we soon learn hes incompetent at best and perhaps guilty of inducing the heroines unwanted abortion by feeding her leadcontaminated pills Do Florent and his wife meet a nominally decent black bookseller in Florida He turns out to be a drunk and a pornographer whose uncle a usedcar salesman always took special pride in cheating who else French Canadians Bad cooking it seems is but the tip of the American iceberg  the Big Mac is really a sort of Trojan Burger meant to lay open the Quebecois homeland to every form of Yankee depravity Mr Beauchemin is certainly gifted particularly in the description of family and friendship His Quebecois are mostly splendid souls and he evokes Montreal extremely well His prose style  at least in what appears to be an excellent translation by Sheila Fischman  is energetic inventive and charmingly colloquial BUT the storys obsession with things American hurts it again and again A long detour to Florida diminishes our sense of Ratablavaskys power and distances us from Slipskins crimes Indeed so much time passes before Florent returns to attack Slipskin Ratablavasky remains elusive that the action seems unjust motivated by simple greed and economic competitiveness This fits the authors notion that capitalism is inherently corrupting but it makes pretty lousy comedy Florents revenge is ugly and costly readers whose sense of the comic does not extend to cockroaches rats and dead children may find their laughter easy to control Mr Beauchemin almost had something remarkable an elegy for the counterculture combined with a comic celebration of the French Canadians But it seems to me that he gave in too easily to cheap prejudices and to social fads masquerading as political insights
IDEAS & TRENDS; DESIGNING AN ETHICAL FRAME FOR MOTHERHOOD BY CONTRACT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/11/weekinreview/ideas-trends-designing-an-ethical-frame-for-motherhood-by-contract.html,SURROGATE mother seemed a cruelly clinical euphemism last week as competing parents fought over a baby in a New Jersey courtroom The legal drama was distinctly modern but the agony of the actors could have been chanted by a Greek chorus Students of medical law and ethics have expected such a battle for several years as the hiring of women to bear babies has become more common Hundreds of substitute mothers have handed over their infants But it was probably inevitable that one would yield to what Mary Beth Whitehead the hired childbearer in New Jersey described as an overpowering maternal bond and citing a mothers rights refuse to go through with the agreement Just as surely an anguished contracting couple in this case William and Elizabeth Stern would assert a fathers right to his child and a legal right to custody The rights of the baby were even less clear Poignantly illustrating the tug of war the infant is called Sara by the Whiteheads and Melissa by the Sterns In the courtroom she is Baby M The case is being fought in what is nearly a legal vacuum No state has yet passed a law governing surrogate motherhood and legal experts are not surprised We tend to pass laws only when the need becomes real said John A Robertson of the University of Texas School of Law Despite the dangers of procrastination many experts warn against a precipitous move to regulate new reproductive technologies which also include in vitro fertilization producing socalled test tube babies and the freezing of embryos for later implantation The problem is that no consensus exists on the proper limits of applying technology to the creation of life Most people agree that new means of helping infertile couples procreate should be pursued while almost everyone is against measures that would devalue life by making babies into commodities But agreement in the unfamiliar moral terrain between those positions is elusive Many Catholic theologians as well as right to life advocates argue against extraordinary measures such as surrogate motherhood and creation of embryos in the laboratory Doctors are also divided and unsure The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has warned its members of the potential pitfalls of becoming involved in surrogate motherhood but does not oppose it At a recent meeting the associations ethics committee reportedly was unable to define a mother in light of all the new techniques The Legality of Contracts Students of ethics differ in their interpretations George J Annas professor of medical law at Boston University argues that no prior contract can override the fact that the woman who gives birth is the legal mother and must voluntarily decide whether to give up the baby Even a law sanctioning surrogate contracts might be found unconstitutional he believes if a mother is not given at least a chance to reconsider Then a custody battle would decide what is best for the child But Dr Robertson sees the right to hire a substitute mother as an aspect of the procreative liberty of married couples He believes that a freely signed agreement can be enforced Using the decadesold technique of artificial insemination surrogate pregnancy is not a result of advanced science the brokers and the contracts are the new elements Novel twists can be expected as more couples hire surrogate gestators to carry embryos created in vitro from their own sperms and eggs This has been done a few times and as the method improves more women who can produce eggs but cannot become pregnant will want to try it In these cases women will be gestational but not genetic mothers The ability to create embryos in the laboratory and freeze them for future implanting has given many couples a welcome chance at childbearing but it has also forced society to confront new ethical dilemmas When is it acceptable to create an embryo or to destroy it To study or even sell it In vitro fertilization programs often produce more embryos than are implanted in the women who give the eggs Presumably extra or damaged embryos are often destroyed outraging those who liken this to what they see as the evil of abortion Others point out that the body itself naturally destroys more embryos than it gestates Paralyzed by controversy in 1979 the Federal Government put a moratorium on financing research on embryos and some states have outlawed the practice The curbs are resented by some researchers and childless couples But experts suspect that some scientists trying to improve the success rate of in vitro fertilization or to fight birth defects may be quietly studying embryos A few babies have already been produced from frozen embryos a technology that could prove useful to couples who for example face sterilization but want children later What has many ethicists worried is the prospect that frozen embryos might be bought and sold for research or for implanting in other women Dr Annas among others believes that commercial trade in frozen embryos should be outlawed Emerging reproductive techniques will often pose questions with no single right answer observed Dr Kenneth Ryan the ethics committee chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Often he said it may be better to keep talking than to jump in with quick pronouncements There may be virtue in commonlaw evolution as rules emerge from fleshandblood cases in the courtroom Dr Ryan suggested We cant always anticipate what a fair and proper law would be

"RELUCTANTLY, JAPAN IS CONTEMPLATING THE PILL",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/weekinreview/reluctantly-japan-is-contemplating-the-pill.html,MORE than two decades after the birth control pill launched a sexual revolution in the United States the Japanese Government is close to officially condoning its use Instead of praise however the move has met with criticism from feminists and wariness from the public which is not expected to switch en masse to oral contraception Japanese sexual attitudes are more conservative than those in the United States Premarital sex is less widespread and the teenage pregnancy rate is onetenth what it is in the United States according to Yasuo Kon executive secretary of the Family Planning Federation of Japan But the Japanese are far from prudish The condom has long been the most popular method of birth control used by 82 percent of married couples according to a national poll conducted last year by Mainichi Shimbun the Tokyo newspaper And abortion is practiced without the religious and moral debate that has divided Americans While the overall abortion rate has been decreasing it is on the rise among teenagers But birth control pills have been officially banned though many women have been able to get them anyway Japans Health and Welfare Ministry has long refused to sanction the pill as a contraceptive but it has approved for therapeutic use a similar drug with a relatively high hormone dose Having obtained prescriptions from sympathetic doctors an estimated 800000 women encouraged by a Government ruling that they are not actually violating any law use this pill for contraception Weve been asking the ministry to liberalize its position on lowhormone pills said Mr Kon of the Family Planning Federation a quasiGovernmental institution under the aegis of the Health and Welfare Ministry Though they have been saying they have to study the side effects of the pills we suspect that they were worried that liberalizing the pill might worsen morals Mr Kon said He noted that the Government also was concerned because it has had to pay compensation after approving such drugs as Thalidomide Whatever the motives for delay it was apparent by last spring that the ministry was moving closer to approving a contraceptive pill Late last year after studying the issue since March an advisory group of medical experts composed entirely of men recommended that the health ministry approve a pill with a lower hormone dosage Following clinical trials and final Government approval which is expected the pill could go on sale in three years The prospect however has not pleased some Japanese feminists who believe that in America the pill has been a mixed blessing They question its safety and worry that the burden of contraception will fall more heavily on women My basic position is against the pill said Miyako Azusa who writes about feminist issues When the pill appeared in the United States it was a blessing to women because women felt they could control their bodies she said But that meant that womens position in sexual relationships with men was weak  they could not say no to men when they did not want a sexual relationship The Pill in America Fears of negative side effects have also made some American women consider the pill less of a panacea than it seemed when it was introduced in the 1960s This might help explain why the proportion of American married couples using the pill dropped to 20 percent in 1982 after reaching a peak of 36 percent in 1973 according to the latest figures compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics But there are other factors involved and it remains to be seen whether future statistics bear out the trend Whatever the reasons the Japanese public appears hesitant to embrace the pill The Mainichi Shimbun poll showed that many people either had little knowledge about the pill or did not plan to use it Only 129 percent of 2600 married women said that if the pill were approved they would use it but 442 percent said they would not and 37 percent could not decide Asked what they thought of the move to approve the pill 48 percent of the women expressed no opinion Mr Kon of the Family Planning Federation said the most likely users would be young single women Most of those who come to the groups clinic wishing to use the highhormone pill for contraception are about 20 years old and unmarried He said the women are tested to insure against adverse effects Then the pill is prescribed for two months If no side effects appear the clinic will extend the prescription But Mr Kon and Ms Azusa predicted that even after the pill is officially approved there will be no dramatic rise in its use Many Japanese have traditionally been reluctant to take hormones reasoning that they might interfere with the bodys natural processes Moreover they said recent publicity about AIDS and other venereal diseases has encouraged the use of condoms Still there are bound to be those for whom the convenience of the pill makes it the contraceptive of choice The pill will be a blessing for some women Ms Azusa said It is a necessary evil BIRTH CONTROL IN JAPAN Views on birth control from family planning poll conducted by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in May 1986 What do you think of the move toward official approval

"BABY M, ETHICS AND THE LAW",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/nyregion/baby-m-ethics-and-the-law.html,The emotional courtroom battle for custody of Baby M has cast a sharp and disquieting light on the tangle of ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding the growing practice of surrogate motherhood In the 10 years since the first publicized arrangement in which a couple paid a woman to be artificially inseminated with the husbands sperm bear a child and relinquish custody to the couple 500 babies have been born into a world virtually devoid of laws to deal with surrogate motherhood And as interest in surrogacy grows  some of it fueled by the events in the Hackensack NJ courtroom where the Baby M case is being heard  people familiar with the practice say disputes are sure to arise that will be even more vexing than the one in which Dr Elizabeth and William Stern are fighting the woman they hired to bear a child for them Mary Beth Whitehead for custody To some who have studied the issue one of the most disturbing elements of surrogate motherhood is the overtone of class exploitation As in the case of Baby M surrogate mothers tend to have less education and less money than their clients Many religious leaders particularly among Roman Catholics and Orthodox Jews bitterly oppose surrogate motherhood saying as New Jersey bishops did in a recent statement that it reduces a human baby to a commodity Others have said that surrogacy makes the relationship between the mother and the biological father a form of adultery At the same time some feminists argue that surrogacy is a womans private business and should not be subject to moral or legal interference As technology outpaces the capacity of the legal system to guide such situations alternative versions of surrogate motherhood are being discussed In at least one case a fetus fertilized in a laboratory has been implanted in a woman who was not the egg donor Such cases in which the woman giving birth is not the genetic mother could raise even more troubling moral and legal issues and open the door to the exploitation of the disadvantaged as breeders for the welltodo Moreover the longterm psychological effects of surrogate motherhood on everyone involved particularly on the children are far from clear While state legislatures and courts begin to struggle with these and other questions the only certainty is that the number of surrogate relationships keeps growing along with the number of lawyers and doctors who specialize in the field 24 Matching Agencies Lori B Andrews an expert in surrogate parenthood with the American Bar Foundation in Chicago a research arm of the American Bar Association estimates that 24 agencies have sprung up around the county to arrange births through surrogate mothers At a typical cost of about 25000 of which 10000 goes to the surrogate mother the agencies can put a mans biological baby into his and his wifes arms Miss Andrews the author of a book on the topic New Conceptions said that although the exact number of such transactions was not available the best estimates were that about 500 children have been born to surrogates in the last decade Noel P Keane who heads the New York Infertility Center which brought together the Sterns and Mrs Whitehead says that since the case gained national prominence last fall his office has received hundreds of calls from people who want children and from women asking about the 10000 fee paid to surrogate mothers Look at this  Vermont Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia  people are calling from all over Mr Keane said underscoring the irony that he might get more business because of the attention given to a surrogate relationship gone wrong But as the Baby M trial unfolds fewer contracts are being signed Mr Keane said Potential clients and surrogates across the country are awaiting the outcome of the New Jersey case in which the Sterns are seeking to force Mrs Whitehead to keep to her agreement to give up the baby conceived with Mr Sterns sperm The baby now 9 months old is in the temporary custody of the Sterns The first phase of the trial on the legality of surrogacy agreements ended Thursday in the Bergen County Superior Court the second phase focusing on custody issues is to begin Feb 2 The judge will rule on both issues at the end of the trial Advantages Over Adoption For childless couples surrogate motherhood offers several attractions over the more traditional adoption route to a family A baby born in surrogacy is after all a blood relative of the inseminating father and couples can exercise considerable discretion in selecting the genetic qualities they want among the hundreds of women who have signed up to be surrogates But most experts agree that the growth in the number of agreements will also mean a growth in the number of disputes The Mary Beth Whitehead and Elizabeth Stern case is not going to be the only one Mr Keane said in an interview at his office on East 60th street in Manhattan Were going to have to go through it again just as we keep having to go through divorce cases and we may even see more of them now that some surrogates may see that Hey maybe I can keep the child Thats why we need laws that spell out these issues for us Mr Keane himself has been sued by Mrs Whitehead who charges that his agency did not fully inform her about her rights or about the Sterns fertility Two Other Refusals Two surrogate mothers in previous cases handled by Mr Keane refused to give up their babies he said Both times their clients declined the court fight that now embroils the Whitheads and the Sterns Dr Philip Parker a Michigan psychiatrist who has studied the issue says he knows of other such cases both here and abroad Although few laws deal with the tangled legal and ethical issues of surrogate motherhood half the states have begun to reexamine their adoption and artificial insemiation laws in light of the gathering public debate on surrogate motherhood according to Miss Andrews of the American Bar Foundation In many of the states laws forbid a woman to take money in connection with putting her child up for adoption But several including New York have held that the fathers biological tie to the infant bars that law from applying to surrogateparent cases There are far fewer laws that would ban it than those that would regulate it Miss Andrews said It is something like when artificial insemination first came into widespread use in the late 1960s Frankly some legislatures were just as horriffied by artificial insemination when it was first starting and only over the years laws were gradually passed not banning it but regulating it A recent legislative recommendation from the New York State Senate Judiciary Committee moves directly to the heart of the Baby M case Among other things it would deny the surrogate mothers right to change her mind and insist that the intended mother must be truly unable to have a child of her own which may not have been true of Mrs Stern I have no illlusions about how difficult this is going to be said state Senator John R Dunne chairman of the panel But the Baby M case has brought attention to the need to do something While the law gropes toward a balance on the issue the demand for babies surges About one American couple in six is said to be unable to have children of their own At the same time abortion and birth control reduce the numbers of white babies available for adoptions and surrogate motherhood is overwhelmingly a white middleclass phenomenon Emotional Awards Besides the 10000 fee he charges for his service Mr Keane said the emotional rewards of his work are ample No one speaks for infertile couples he said Although they may be one out of every six married couples in this country they are a very loosely connected group a very private group and their pain and cries are heard only in their homes and in their doctors office and in this office Mr Keane said he was aware of the concern that surrogate mothers not be exploited by couples with higher social and economic status I am sensitive to that question he said but I can say that most of the volunteers who want to be surrogates dont do it for the money aspect but because they wish to share the gift of a child with a childless couple A study by Dr Parker a professor at Wayne State University outside Detroit showed that surrogates were motivated by a strong urge to help others but found that 89 percent of the wouldbe surrogates interviewed said they would not do it without being paid Others problems are likely to arise from arrangements such as the one Mr Keane made for a Japanese couple Their embryo fertilized in a laboratory is now growing in an American surrogate mother he said Because the baby was conceived by the Japanese womans egg and her husbands sperm the baby will have none of the American womans genetic characteristics Dr Parker agreed that the legal thicket was likely to grow more complex So far no surrogate has died in childbirth but what happens when one does he wondered
WASHINGTON; THE STATE OF THE UNION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/opinion/washington-the-state-of-the-union.html,On the 27th of January 1987 President Reagan will deliver his seventh annual State of the Union address to the 100th Congress of the United States at the beginning of the 200th anniversary of the Federal Constitution Cappy Weinberger says we are living through a really remarkable American renaissance but some other folks here think the state of the Union is not so hot They point to the record budget and trade deficits to the foreign policy and Wall Street scandals to the nuclear arms race and to the gaps between the rich and the poor between love and lust and between the prosperity of one region and the adversity of others In fact theyre wondering out loud if something isnt seriously wrong with the the system and suggesting that we should change it and bring it up to date for the 21st century now just around the next turn in the long journey Some of them would put Presidents in for six years instead of four others would make it easier to recall dubs from the White House and keep better tabs on their health still others want a national primary to nominate Presidents or constitutional amendments to balance the budget and stamp out abortion Here I proclaim myself a certified stickinthemud I cant remember a time when so many alluring reforms were floating down the Potomac some of them worth considering or a worse time to consider them seriously For the capital is in a flighty and distracted mood divided leaderless and in no shape to edit the Founding Fathers Besides all this present uproar between the White House and the Congress over sneaking guns to Iran and the Nicaraguan contras doesnt prove that the system has broken down but that its still working still exposing and correcting error and still staggering along after two centuries Its not the system thats wrong but some of the people who have been evading and corrupting it Colonel North with or without higher authority  we still dont know which  regarded the Congress as a nuisance to be avoided and manipulated The system didnt let us down it saved us It didnt of course tell us how to handle the Russians or compete with the Japanese or preserve our cities or elect the most qualified men and women to public office or educate our children In fact it assumed human stupidity ambition greed and religious fanaticism and merely suggested a few rules to hold things together One of these rules was that no one person not even the President let alone Colonel North had the right to impose his will or ideology in secret on the elected representatives of the people The purpose of the system was to assure the authority of the President subject to the checks and balances of the Congress and the courts without creating as Mr Lincoln put it a government too strong for the liberties of the people or too weak to maintain itself against its enemies at home or abroad It was precisely this defiance of the principle of accountability that led to the recent mistakes at the Reykjavik summit and the Irancontra scandals And all these investigations are not designed merely to rake over the past but to restore the principle of accountability in the future In this sense the State of the President is sad if not bad but the State of the Union is good or anyway fairly good Cappy has stars in his eyes as usual about a new American renaissance free of nuclear weapons and defended by shields in outer space but the system is keeping these dreams in balance There hasnt been a Reagan counterrevolution against the New Deal or the Great Society but merely a useful correction The public purposes of the Democratic glory days went too far along the lines of the welfare state and had to be amended but they were not destroyed So the ideology of the supplysiders with their emphasis on private gain  Ask not what you can do for your country but for yourself  is being tugged back to the middle Everywhere in the world the attempts to make human life conform to some sharp ideology have failed Communism socialism free market capitalism are all in the process of adjustment to the realities Its an awkward painful process but as somebody has said the answer to democracys problems is not less democracy but more not less accountability but more not more confrontation but more cooperation
2D SEATTLE BISHOP TAKING A MORE VISIBLE ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/19/us/2d-seattle-bishop-taking-a-more-visible-role.html,Nearly a year after the Vatican sent Auxiliary Bishop Donald Wuerl to Seattle with a mission to bring more orthodox teachings to Roman Catholics here he has begun to assert his moral authority In his first major public appearance outside the church Bishop Wuerl led an antiabortion rally to the steps of the State Capitol on Friday where he was welcomed by some Catholics who perceive a shift by the archdiocese toward more conservative social concerns Today Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen who shares power with Bishop Wuerl celebrated a Mass for Life condemning the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Before Archbishop Hunthausen was forced to relinquish some of his authority to the more conservative Bishop Wuerl the Seattle church was known for lending its voice to such causes as opposing nuclear arms and supporting the rights of homosexuals and a more active church role for women Since the powersharing arrangement took effect the two men have disagreed over whether to support a county ordinance backing homosexual employment rights but both prelates are vocal in opposing abortion Archbishop Hunthausen who tried last fall to get fellow bishops to intervene with the Vatican and end the unique powersharing arrangement looked strong and fit today in his first public appearance since cancer surgery more than a month ago The antiabortion mass was celebrated at St James Cathedral where he had once allowed a homosexual group Dignity to hold a churchsanctioned service That service became one of the main charges against the 65yearold Archbishop after a Vatican investigation of his ministry Today the Archbishop urged his congregation to pray for those who make civil laws that sometimes violate the laws of God those whose legal and judicial shortsightedness help to create a system in which life is cheap Abortion as both a moral and medical issue is one of the areas in which Archbishop Hunthausen was stripped of his power last year The others include ministry to homosexuals marriage tribunal matters training of priests and liturgical matters But until this week Catholics here say Bishop Wuerls presence has been minimal and most priests and nuns have said through petitions that Archbishop Hunthausen remains their spiritual leader Earlier this month a group of nuns and lay members announced plans to hold a fast and vigil until Archbishop Hunthausens powers were restored but they canceled it after he said it could lead to further division Bishop Wuerl 46 who had not talked to reporters since his new role was made public last September said Friday in the capital that he chose the antiabortion rally as his first political appearance because abortion is a prime moral concern to all Catholics I dont look upon this as a political event he said asserting that concern for the rights of the unborn was part of overall Catholic teaching on a wide variety of issues he called prolife Asked if he would consider attending one of the many rallies agains nuclear arms that Archbishop Hunthausen has championed Bishop Wuerl said Well take each event as they come along Today the Archbishop departed briefly from his prepared speech against abortion and decried those who have come to accept violence and the stockpiling of arms  as a solution to the worlds problems Bishop Wuerl asked about political differences with Archbishop Hunthausen said the two men have no dispute on matters of the Gospel He would not comment further on his arrangement with Archbishop Hunthausen saying the two men had agreed not to discuss their relationship At the Olympia rally attended by about 2000 protesters including many children bussed in from local Catholic schools Bishop Wuerl drew loud cheers when he told the crowd that abortion continues to erode the most fundamental value that holds people together respect for human life He coupled his antiabortion message with a statement against the death penalty which met with silence
BAN ON CIGARETTE ADS TO BE URGED IN CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/19/us/ban-on-cigarette-ads-to-be-urged-in-congress.html,Backed by a declaration by the Surgeon General that cigarettes harm nonsmokers and a 1986 Supreme Court decision suggesting that the Government could prohibit cigarette advertising advocates of such a ban are planning a major push for it in Congress this year At issue is more than 2 billion a year that the cigarette companies spend to place advertising in magazines and newspapers and to sponsor events as diverse as the Virginia Slims tennis tournament the Kool Jazz Festival and an exhibition of Turkish art that is to open this week at the National Gallery of Art with the support of the Philip Morris Companies Increase in Cigarette Tax In addition Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey plans to attack cigarettes on two other fronts seeking laws to double the excise tax from the present 16 cents a pack to 32 cents and prohibit cigarette manufacturers from reporting advertising expenses as tax deductions A bill prohibiting advertising was first introduced in the last session of Congress by Representative Mike Synar Democrat of Oklahoma mostly to force a discussion of the issue according to Congressional aides Mr Synar plans to reintroduce the measure next month It is expected to draw strong support from those in Congress who oppose smoking as well as public health groups such as the American Medical Association the American Cancer Society the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association Lining up in opposition are the cigarette industry members of Congress Mrom tobaccoproducing states the advertising industry newspaper and magazine publishers people active in civil liberty matters who see the proposals as threats to the First Amendments guarantees of free press and free speech and others who see the proposals as government meddling in peoples personal affairs The Tobacco Institute a major lobbying force in Washington has vowed to defeat the proposed prohibition on advertising Broadcast Ads Are Banned Testifying last year at a Congressional hearing Mr Synar asserted that it was illogical for cigarette ads to be banned on television and radio but allowed elsewhere Instead we should make the law consistent by extending the current ban to the print media billboards and the sponsorship of sporting and other events he said Among the opponents to an advertising prohibition is the American Association of Advertising Agencies The groups executive vice president John E OToole contended that commercial free speech had strong protections in the Constitution and he cited Supreme Court cases that held that for a government to institute an advertising ban it must show that the ban would further the governments interest In the case of cigarettes he said the Government would not be able to show that an advertising ban would reduce cigarette consumption a point disputed by proponents of the prohibition Tax Increase Is Predicted On the other hand Mr OToole said he believes a tax increase is more likely It is a popular issue especially at a time when the Government needs money he said This will be a tough one to defeat In a recent speech in New Jersey Senator Bradley a former college and professional basketball star said The message behind tobacco billboards and magazine ads that portray young and athletic models enjoying tobacco is clear We need to tell young people that smoking is not glamorous It does not help you live a long or athletic life The promotional activities of tobacco companies imply that this is the case and it simply is not true Mr Bradley plans to join with Senator John W Chafee Republican of Rhode Island in submitting the bill forbidding tax writeoffs for cigarette advertising A Bradley aide said this would yield the Treasury 24 billion over the next three years on the assumption that advertising spending would remain at current levels an assumption questioned by the advertising industry Asked about the legality of singling out one industry to restrict its advertising expense deductions Mr Bradleys aide said that since a business deduction was a privilege and not a right Congress could approve or disapprove any particular deduction However he acknowledged that no other product had been so singled out Prices Affect Consumption Opponents of smoking are following Senator Bradleys proposed tax increase closely because cigarette sales are very sensitive to price increases One estimate is that a 10 percent increase in price would result in a 4 percent decrease in use among adults and a 14 percent decrease among teenagers Representative Harold Rogers Republican of Kentucky a major tobaccoproducing state said that while the members of Congress from such states were not rallying the troops at this point he expected that they would later when the threat became strong I expect a battle all year long Mr Rogers said with skirmishes on different fronts  Mr Rogers said he was bothered by the notion that the Government would be telling people whether or not they should do something that it is their lawful right to do  it is brainwashing Furthermore Representative Rogers repeated the tobacco industrys position that cigarette advertising was not aimed at attracting nonsmokers to smoke but rather to induce people who already smoked to switch brands Constitutional Protections Regarding the proposal to double the Federal excise tax on cigarettes Representative Rogers said that it would make smoking a rich mans exercise penalizing the poor man The only law on the subject in the United States is the one that banned cigarette ads from radio and television in 1971 Congress was able to pass the measure without substantial challenges on constitutional grounds because broadcasting uses the public airwaves and generally has not been accorded the same constitutional protections as magazines and newspapers Susan Arnold associate director of the Coalition on Smoking or Health a major antismoking organization said a full advertising ban existed in Sweden Norway and Finland Ms Arnold also said the coalition supported the tax increase and she predicted that one would be passed this year although it might not amount to a doubling To advocate a tax increase she said an ad hoc organization of 48 health public service and education organizations has been formed including the American Medical Association the Association of Junior Leagues the Young Mens Christian Association and the American Public Health Association Called A Dangerous Precedent According to the American Newspaper Publishers Association which opposes an advertising prohibition truthful ads for any lawful product or service are protected by the First Amendment If the tobacco industry is banned from advertising it would set a dangerous precedent for other lawful things that some people may not like said Rene P Milan the associations counsel Other products might be subject to attempted advertising bans she said such as beer and wine red meat sugar and eggs Where do you draw the line Mrs Milan asked The newspaper associations opposition is based more on longrange implications that any immediate loss of revenues since tobacco advertising accounts for only 1 percent of newspaper revenues Magazines on the other hand draw more cigarette advertising because of they can present the ads in color and on glossy paper Newspapers for the most part are limited to black ink on paper of far lower quality First Amendment Argument A similar position is taken by the American Civil Liberties Union whose executive director Ira Glasser said We have always been against bans of advertising any products that are legal to sell Mr Glasser said that commercial speech was not as well protected as political speech but that the lines had been blurred in recent years He cited the example of attempts to forbid advertisments for abortion clinics saying They are commercial advertising but the motivation was political so the lines get to be pretty difficult to define Mr Glasser said it was clear that cigarettes were unhealthy but that this was not the issue Clearly the most abused and destructive drug in our society is alcohol and no one is advocating an advertising ban for it he said How about fats in the diet Will ads for ice cream be banned The Congressional Research Service a division of the Library of Congress conducted an analysis of the constitutionality of an advertising ban and concluded that Congress clearly has the authority to regulate tobacco advertising subject to some limitations For a legislative ban to be upheld as constitutional the research service said in a report its proponents would have to demonstrate that the government has a substantial interest in reducing smoking that the ban directly advances that interest and that there are no other less restrictive means of accomplishing the same result Casino Gambling Case The report also cited last years Supreme Court decision which upheld Puerto Ricos law restricting local advertising of casino gambling a legal enterprise in the commonwealth That 5 to 4 decision which was written by Associate Justice William H Rehnquist who is now the Chief Justice reasoned that if it would be constitutional for a state to prohibit the sale of a product deemed harmful the state might also take the lesser step of banning or restricting advertising of that product without banning its sale The Reagan Administration has declined to state its position on the question but it has allowed the Surgeon General Dr C Everett Koop to testify at Congressional hearings as a private citizen against cigarette advertising Dr Koop has estimated that cigarette smoking is the cause each year of more than 300000 deaths in the United States from heart disease lung cancer and noncancerous respiratory diseases
MOTIVATIONS OF SURROGATE MOTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/science/motivations-of-surrogate-mothers.html,WOMEN who choose to become surrogate mothers have motivations ranging from selflessness to egocentricity from guilt to joy according to the handful of researchers who have studied them The researchers are finding that beyond money or the fulfillment of pregnancy surrogate mothers may have guilt over a past abortion gratitude over being adopted themselves the need to reenact their own childhood abandonment or other deep psychological factors As researchers seek the psychological motives that lead a woman to be a surrogate mother they are struggling to reach agreement on the signs that indicate a woman would be a risky candidate A consensus is emerging but it is by no means unanimous One psychiatrist who interviews wouldbe surrogate mothers in Detroit for instance rarely rejects any of the candidates so long as they understand what they are agreeing to A program in Los Angeles on the other hand accepts only one in ten applicants Experts say some women who become surrogate mothers may fail to provide the infant with proper prenatal care become seriously depressed when they must give up the baby or balk at surrendering the child at all Refusal to give up the child raises legal questions on surrogacy as well since an agreement or contract is involved Fewer than one in a hundred surrogate mothers are believed to have refused to give up their infants One who has is Mary Beth Whitehead a New Jersey woman who agreed through an organization that arranges surrogacy to bear a child for Dr Elizabeth and William Stern but is now contesting the agreement and is seeking custody of the infant girl known as Baby M A judge in Hackensack NJ is hearing the case and his ruling will be among the first on the puzzling legal questions Moral and religious questions too abound Psychologists are confronting a shortage of definitive data on some of the most urgent questions particularly which psychological traits indicate that a prospective surrogate mother will have emotional difficulty sticking to the original agreement A new study on 30 women who had babies as surrogates for example found that 3 of the women were so distraught after giving up the babies that they needed therapeutic counseling Such psychological counseling is now the exception rather than the rule a situation some researchers criticize But interviews with the three women before and during the pregnancy produced no obvious indications that difficulties lay ahead We cannot predict with any certainty how a surrogate mother will do psychologically or whether she will decide to keep the child said Philip Parker the Detroit psychiatrist who has interviewed almost 500 women who sought to become surrogate mothers He interviews prospective surrogate mothers for Noel P Keane the head of the center that made the arrangements between Mrs Whitehead and the Sterns However Dr Parker who conducts interviews in Detroit not in New York did not do the psychological testing of Mrs Whitehead From interviews with the hundreds of women who sought to become surrogate mothers psychologists and psychiatrists have been able to draw a psychological portrait of the needs and conflicts at work in a woman who desires to have a baby for another couple And many experts now agree on some psychological signs that cast doubt on a womans desirability as a surrogate No single motive explains why a given woman would seek to bear a child for another couple In any given woman the experts say there is a mix of several needs and desires with some more predominant The money offered  usually 10000 plus all expenses  is a significant factor for about 9 of 10 women studies have found But psychological factors are more important the experts say Indeed some psychologists who interview prospective surrogate mothers said that a woman who was interested in only the money was a poor candidate and would be turned down The Joys of Pregnancy The strongest characteristic of the women who do best as surrogate mothers is perhaps understandably that they enjoy being pregnant In a California study comparing women who had volunteered as surrogates with similar women who had not the trait that distinguished most strongly between the groups was that the surrogates find pregnancy a positive experience These are women who get pregnant and give birth easily have very few complications and feel at their healthiest when they are pregnant said Hilary Hanafin a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who did the study An article published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that 90 percent of surrogate mothers studied had been pregnant before Being pregnant makes them feel fulfilled as a woman said Dr Parker Apart from the pleasures of pregnancy simple compassion for the childless couple plays a role Many of the women who get pregnant easily feel it is unfair that other women cannot Being able to offer an infant to a childless couple gives a surrogate mother a sense that this is the one thing I can do special in my life according to Dr Hanafin A major motive is a sense of altruism said Isadore Schmukler a clinical psychologist who gives psychological tests to women who apply to the Surrogate Mother Program an agency in Manhattan They see themselves as able to give an extraordinary gift to a couple in need Tests also show that women who become surrogate mothers tend to have higher than average empathy according to Dr Hanafin The womans strong empathy with the childless couple makes her more easily able to separate from the child when it is born The couples joy minimizes the pain of separation from the baby Dr Hanafin said A Cushion Against Pain During the pregnancy surrogate mothers often cushion themselves against the pain of giving up their babies researchers are finding Researchers are now trying to find ways to identify in advance psychological signs that a woman had this ability In many of the surrogate mothers he has tested you dont see fantasies of what the infant will be like from the beginning they lack the usual emotional ties said Dr Schmukler They dont perceive it psychologically as theirs As would be expected however in an experience as intensely personal as pregnancy and birth most of the women who have been surrogate mothers feel some loss when the time comes to give up the baby While few foresee the sadness they may feel at the loss of the baby all the women he studied who had given up a child felt grief according to Dr Parker In a study of 30 surrogate mothers he found that the grief after giving up the child varied from a single crying spell to months of remorse Three of the women became so depressed that they needed therapy Perhaps 10 percent of women who sought to become surrogate mothers had been adopted themselves as children or were very close to someone who had been adopted some studies have found Some researchers say these women see giving a baby to a childless couple as an expression of gratitude for the life they were given in their adoptive homes A lingering guilt usually about an abortion motivates some applicants the studies have shown About onethird of 500 women interviewed by Dr Parker had had an abortion or had given up a baby for adoption For women who feel extreme guilt over an abortion being a surrogate allows them to get over their remorse and grieving said Dr Hanafin Among the main psychological traits that would disqualify a prospective surrogate mother is an inability to handle separation and loss well according to Dr Hanafin Some women are trying to compensate through pregnancy for a loss in their life said Dr Hanafin who screens applicants at the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills One woman who applied for example had a child who was childnapped by her former husband two years earlier and she had never dealt with that loss Dr Hanafin suspected the woman subconsciously wanted another child and rejected her as a surrogate Negative Indications Among the signs cited by experts that a woman might have difficulty giving up the baby or become extremely depressed afterward are compulsive promiscuity a long series of unstable relationships or a childhood trauma such as abandonment by a parent abuse or neglect I interviewed one woman who had been abandoned by her mother as an infant said Dr Schmukler There is the strong possibility a woman like that will reenact her own earlier trauma through the pregnancy and giving up the child she would repeat her original abandonment by becoming the parent and deserting the child It is our moral obligation not to be part of her compulsion to repeat the trauma Dr Schmukler said On the other hand she might try to reverse the trauma by keeping the child Either way it would be a traumatic experience for her or the couple Our goal is to find people who will experience giving up the child as a psychological gain rather than a traumatic loss Among the psychological signs that a prospective surrogate mother might want to keep the baby rather than give it up according to Dr Schmukler is a weak sense of self Such women might want a baby as an external crutch to fill up a feeling of emptiness in their lives or make them feel better if they are depressed Dr Schmukler said The Positive Signs The psychological screening seeks to identify women who are independent feel themselves worthwhile and do not have a desperate need for a baby to enhance their feelings about themselves The character of prospective surrogates is also scrutinized If the psychological tests suggest an applicant might be a sociopath were worried she would lie to us or blackmail the couple for more money or ignore proper maternal care for the baby Dr Hanafin said Perhaps the most common reason for rejecting women who seek to become surrogate mothers is that they do not seem to fully understand the emotional impact of what they would be agreeing to and how it might affect their lives In the initial interviews applicants are typically asked to imagine how they will deal with the feelings that giving up their baby will evoke and what they will tell their children or neighbors after the pregnancy when the baby is gone Some experts argue that the numbers of surrogate mothers who have been studied scientifically are as yet too small to provide definitive guidelines on who is or is not an good candidate They say more research is urgently needed There are no conclusive data Dr Parker said Whether to disqualify a woman is for the time being a moral question not a scientific one
STORMY PROSECUTOR ROILS POLITICAL WATERS IN FLORIDA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/us/stormy-prosecutor-roils-political-waters-in-florida.html,To his supporters Robert W Merkle is a folk hero a combative Federal prosecutor who is undaunted by political pressure as he pursues corrupt officeholders and illegal drug traffickers a colorful troubadour whose ballads and comical impressions have added a satirical edge to his battle with the legal and political establishments But to his critics who include the states new Republican Governor its two Democratic Senators prominent lawyers and major newspapers he is a reckless zealot who has abused the powers of his office and smeared the reputations of innocent people Mr Merkle a Republican who has been United States Attorney in Floridas Middle District since 1983 is at the center of a political controversy that has reached the White House where officials are considering whether to replace him to appease Gov Bob Martinez whose political allies include Jeb Bush son of the Vice President Mr Merkles term expired last April and since then he has served at the pleasure of the President The furor over the conduct of Mr Merkle a 42yearold former football player at Notre Dame whose nickname is Mad Dog Merkle crested earlier this month Mr Martinez two days after his inauguration found himself confronting Mr Merkle in a Federal courtroom as a defense witness for Nelson Italiano a prominent Tampa Democrat accused of mail fraud involving a cable television bribery scheme Mr Italiano was convicted Governor on Witness Stand For almost five hours the Governor who was not charged with a crime defended himself against the allegations of a Government witness Eddie Perdomo who said he had given Mr Martinez 8000 in campaign contributions and cash gifts in 1979 when Mr Martinez was a candidate for mayor of Tampa as part of an attempt to buy favors for the cable television company While the Governor was testifying his chief of staff J M Stipanovich said Mr Martinez had called Mitch Daniels the White House political director to ask that President Reagan replace Mr Merkle a move that heightened the political drama surrounding the case Theres nothing partisan about him Mr Stipanovich said in an interview This man believes he was commissioned by God to smite politicians Some critics contend that Mr Merkle whatever his legal skills is tempermentally unsuited for his job that he goes out of his way to personalize his battles with elected officials and lawyers He can be as provocative outside the courtroom as inside they say Mr Merkle the father of nine children has won strong support from antiabortion groups by denouncing the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion as judicial tyranny Last year he entertained one Republican audience by doing a comical impression of Bob Graham the Democratic Governor at the time who is now a United States Senator Mr Merkle stuffed cotton in his jaws to affect his subjects pudgy face He often ends his speeches to local audiences by picking up his guitar and singing a song he composed My Heroes Have Always Been Lawyers which some lawyers view as a slur on their profession How can he not be popular with a lot of people asked one lawyer here He goes out of his way to show his contempt for lawyers and politicians Call for His Dismissal The St Petersburg Times a critic of Mr Merkle published two editorials this month calling for his dismissal saying in one that Mr Merkle has built a record of prosecuting people without evidence to convict and smearing those he lacked evidence to indict The jury convicted Mr Italiano of mail fraud but apparently without giving much consideration to the allegations against Mr Martinez We didnt really pay much attention to it said Edward Heitger the jury foreman At a news conference Mr Merkle defended his decision to present the Perdomo testimony against the Governor to the jury saying the Federal judge in the case had ruled that it was admissible to lay out the full scope of the bribery scheme If you accuse me of misconduct he said then you are accusing the judge of misconduct His critics say the Martinez case is typical of the tactics Mr Merkle has used to damage the reputations of other prominent citizens who were never charged with crimes For example they say Mr Merkle investigated E J Salcines the Hillsborough County State Attorney for three years yet never brought charges against him Mr Salcines was defeated for reelection after news reports disclosed that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against selfincrimination before a Federal grand jury Barry Cohen Mr Salciness defense lawyer collected affidavits from state prosecutors lawenforcement officers and others who accused Mr Merkle of McCarthylike conduct and of trying to intimidate grand jury witnesses Mr Cohen presented them to the Department of Justice which cleared Mr Merkle Sharp Exchange Over Case The Salcines case also prompted Mr Graham then Governor to call for an investigation of Mr Merkles office The prosecutor responded with a sharply worded letter accusing Mr Graham who had defeated Senator Paula Hawkins the Republican who nominated Mr Merkle for his job of political meddling in Federal investigations Not surprisingly Mr Merkle wrote your concerns once again sound of politics In the same letter Mr Merkle asserted that the states senior Senator Lawton Chiles had told him before his Senate confirmation hearing that he expected him to ignore rumors of widespread political corruption in the Tampa area Mr Chiles who denied the prosecutors account of their conversation has joined the states other major political figures Republicans and Democrats in the campaign to bring about Mr Merkles removal from office Lawyers and elected officials here acknowledge that some of the attacks on Mr Merkle have missed their mark serving only to strengthen his public support Last year The Tampa Tribune ran an editorial calling for his dismissal including in its bill of particulars his prosecution of an Assistant State Attorney Michael Giordano who pleaded guilty to four counts of possessing illegal drugs with intent to distribute After Mr Giordano pleaded guilty and was placed on probation he was greeted with the applause from lawyers and colleagues as he left the courthouse a spectacle that Merkle supporters still cite as an example of why Mr Merkles zeal is needed here I have always maintained that politics and law enforcement do not mix Mr Merkle said adding that my phone has been ringing off the hook with calls of support If Im asked to go Ill go gracefully But until then Im going to keep on going after crooks

JUSTICES BAR A LAW LIMITING APPEALS MADE DOOR TO DOOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/21/us/justices-bar-a-law-limiting-appeals-made-door-to-door.html,The Supreme Court today struck down an Illinois citys ordinance barring all doortodoor soliciting before 9 AM after 5 PM and on Sundays and holidays ruling it was a violation of the right to free speech In another case involving free speech the Court agreed to review a lower court ruling that a principals censorship of studentwritten articles about divorce and teenage pregnancy and sexuality in a high school newspaper violated the First Amendment In the doortodoor soliciting case without issuing an opinion or allowing full briefing and oral argument the Court voted 6 to 3 to affirm rulings by Federal district and appellate courts that struck down the ordinance in Watseka Ill The Courts decision City of Watseka v Illinois Public Action Council No 86631 sets a binding national precedent but one that lower courts will be free to interpret narrowly because the Court did not explain its reasoning or consider the case worthy of full review Public Action Group Involved The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in the case that the ordinance was overly restrictive of efforts by the Illinois Public Action Council to seek support for its representation of low and moderateincome people on energy tax and economic development issues The nonprofit advocacy group wanted to solicit from door to door from 4 PM to 9 PM when more working people would be at home Justice Byron R White dissented in a brief opinion joined by Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day OConnor Asserting that the appellate court had departed from the Supreme Courts precedents they said the High Court should have granted full review and suggested that the ordinance was valid To Prevent Crime The dissenters said that the purpose of the ordinance is to protect citizens privacy and to prevent crime obviously legitimate governmental objectives and that governments should have latitude to impose such neutral restrictions on the time place and manner of speech The school newspaper case began in 1983 when the principal of a high school near St Louis barred publication of studentwritten articles that included discussions by unidentified pregnant students about their sexual activities and pregnancies and comments by other students about their parents divorces In their appeal to the Supreme Court school officials supported by the National School Boards Association urged the Court to clear up widespread confusion about the authority of school officials to keep materials they consider objectionable out of school newspapers yearbooks plays and other activities Todays action comes in the wake of decisions by the Court last year and the year before giving school officials broad leeway to discipline students for indecent speech and authorizing officials to search students if they have a reasonable basis for suspecting a violation of law or school rules The Court will hear arguments in the pending case Hazelwood School District v Kuhlmeier No 86836 next fall and will probably issue a ruling sometime in 1988 The suit by three student staff members of the Hazelwood East High School newspaper against the principal and other school officials was originally dismissed by a Federal district judge He ruled that the principal had acted reasonably to protect the privacy of the pregnant students to avoid the appearance that the school approved of or condoned their sexual practices to protect the sensibilities of immature student readers and to assure fairness to the divorced parents who had not been given a chance to respond But a divided United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed this decision It ruled that the newspaper enjoyed broad freedom under the First Amendment as a public forum intended to be a conduit for student viewpoint Official censorship could be justified only to prevent substantial disruption of the school or violations of law such as libel or invasion of privacy the appeals court said School Helps Support Newspaper The Hazelwood school officials stressed in their appeal that Spectrum the newspaper was financed in part by the school and was written and edited for academic credit by students in an advanced journalism often in class as part of the official curriculum In a brief urging the High Court not to hear the appeal the newspaper staff members who have since graduated said the reason for the censorship was that the articles offended the personal sensibilities of the school officials In other actions today the Court did these things  Let stand a Federal appellate ruling that threw out a 125 million award by a Federal District Court in a suit against the Government by families of four New England lobstermen who drowned in a 1980 storm The appellate court ruled the Government could not be held legally responsible for erroneous weather forecasts by the National Weather Service even if they were caused by negligent failure to maintain an offshore weather buoy  Declined to review two unrelated lower court rulings that upheld court orders limiting picketing by people opposed to abortion near abortion clinics  Held that it had no jurisdiction to review a lower court decision upholding a Montgomery

NEW HAMPSHIRE G.O.P. TRIES TO UNDERSTAND KEMP,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/22/us/new-hampshire-gop-tries-to-understand-kemp.html,Some conservatives criticize him as not being true enough to the cause Average Republicans complain that he speaks over their heads And so when Representative Jack F Kemp finally got some kind words from the right place this week it made all that sliding through the snows of New Hampshire worthwhile Mr Kemp could not say enough about how much he liked admired and respected Patrick J Buchanan the White House communications director who announced Tuesday that he would not run for President in part because Mr Kemps service to the cause of conservatism has earned him an unimpeded shot at the nomination Mr Kemp who will formally announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination in April got the good news about Mr Buchanan after he spoke to the Rotary Club here The address was a classic of the Kemp genre demonstrating both why Republicans like him and why they worry about him There was his usual boundless enthusiasm for free enterprise low taxes Ronald Reagan democracy and opportunity for all If America doesnt lead the free world he declared quoting Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn the free world will not have a leader Communication Problem But there were also the passages that drive audiences to distraction or at least to the dictionary The budget deficit Mr Kemp told a questioner was actually dropping in nominal terms which surprised the Rotarian who thought it was pretty big The Russians Mr Kemp said have to be pushed to disinvest in offensive capability by which he meant they should build fewer missiles On Monday Mr Kemp went oneonone with perhaps his least threatening challenger Pierre S du Pont 4th former Governor of Delaware In the view of many in the audience Mr Kemp came out second Speaking before the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women Mr du Pont won the audience with jokes pointing out that he was the only announced candidate and thus constituted 100 percent of the people who are running for President He moved that the nominations be closed Then Mr du Pont laid out some of the specific and simple ideas that are at the center of his campaign End all farm subsidies require everyone on welfare to work test high school students for drugs and deny the ones who flunk a drivers license Mr Kemp gave a cutdown version of his usual address on supplyside economics Theres no limit to what free men free women free markets free enterprise and a free society can accomplish he said 4 Give Nod to du Pont At a table where four Republicans from Amherst NH took it all in the verdict was unanimous Mr Kemp was a good man certainly better than any of the Democrats but he lacked something Mr du Pont at least made them laugh  and they understood what he was saying With a full year before this state votes Mr Kemp argues plausibly that he has plenty of time to refine his act Ive got to learn to close down a speech and Ive got to learn when to close down an answer he said He promised a group of reporters that the next time he said and in conclusion he would make one and only one point and then stop An hour later before the Rotarians he kept the promise allowing but 2 minutes and 35 seconds to pass between the in conclusion and the end of the speech But even if he solves the style problems Mr Kemp faces a more fundamental one how to sell to a rather contented Republican constituency his unusual mixture of conservative ardor and a desire to broaden the base of the party Ironically some Democrats agree with Mr Kemp that his mixture of populism and conservatism a hopeful and inclusive message is just what the Republicans need to keep together the Reagan coalition of lowtax libertarians social conservatives and pragmatic working class voters who admire results over theory Mr Kemp is trying hard to work Mr Reagans magic using profamily antiabortion oratory but emphasizing tolerance of other views talking about low taxes and a smaller government but accenting the need to lift all boats especially those of blacks and the unemployed But the result so far said David Boaz vice president of the Cato Institute a libertarian research organization in Washington is that the various wings of conservatism were not sure Mr Kemp was one of them The libertarians think hes too much of a traditionalist said Mr Boaz and the traditionalists think hes too much of a libertarian Mr Kemp is remaining his natural optimistic self If he has a few problems these days with Republicans he said that may be because hes the Republican who can best appeal to Democrats an asset his fellow partisans will come to appreciate It was the Grand Old Party and to me it was boring very boring he said of preReagan Republicanism The party philosophy he said was If it feels good it must be bad and if it feels bad it must be good Jack Kemp continues to believe that feel good Republicanism even of his slightly prolix variety will beat a sparer pessimism any day NEW YORKERS BACKING BUSH WASHINGTON Jan 21 Special to The New York Times  A majority of New Yorks Republican members of Congress will

from Des Moines Tuesday night after a speech to hundreds of enthusiastic Iowa homebuilders Senator Bob Dole was asked when he would start setting up a Presidential campaign organization in this pivotal state The Senate Republican leader whose organizational efforts are lagging behind those of Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York said with a smile that he would name an organization soon that would knock your socks off The Iowa Presidential caucuses are more than a year away but Mr Dole as well as his Republican rivals is not only campaigning hard in the state but is also seeking to assemble local staffs and build networks here Mr Dole a Republican from neighboring Kansas who made more than a dozen trips to Iowa last year is according to Calvin O Hultman Republican leader of the State Senate one of us  he speaks our language Mr Doles message to the homebuilders was typical of his political appearances in recent months He said the Federal deficit was perhaps the nations major problem and that Americans should support Ronald Reagan and he made it clear that he was very much seeking the Presidency He Talks Like Us Just listen to Bob Dole Mr Hultman a strong Dole supporter said that night He talks like us Hes a Midwesterner People know where hes coming from He added that Mr Bush is a nice guy but a lot of people here think Reagan is a liability to him because of farm policy For the moment the Reagan Administrations agricultural policies coupled with the IranNicaragua scandal have hurt Mr Bush who lost ground to Mr Dole last month in a poll by The Des Moines Register That poll showed Iowa Republicans favored Mr Dole over Mr Bush for the 1988 nomination by 28 percent to 25 percent while a similar poll six months earlier had Mr Bush leading Mr Dole by 34 percent to 16 percent But Republicans here and in Washington and even some Dole supporters make it plain that the Kansas Republican has organization problems on the state and national level that could damage his Presidential prospects in a primary and caucus campaign that may be brief and intense The one thing that has substantial numbers of party activists scratching their head about Bob Dole is there seems to be a candidate surge but not a concurrent organizational surge said Richard N Bond national political director of the Bush campaign Doubts on Organization Edward J Rollins the former White House political director who is now a political strategist for Mr Kemp said Bob Dole has made progress in terms of name recognition and being a viable alternative but theres no real ontheground organization yet and that could hurt him John Buckley Mr Kemps spokesman said that although Mr Dole was a popular figure in the Republican Party His ability to convert that into troops on the ground to organize for him has been very slow off the mark David A Keene a senior political adviser to Mr Dole responded If they want to think that thats fine When we announce what weve got in Iowa as well as nationally people will be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised depending on their perspective Nonetheless Mr Doles national organization remains somewhat fragmentary and without the poll takers press staff speechwriters and advisers already in place on the Kemp and Bush teams One of Mr Doles aides conceded privately that the Senate minority leader unlike say Mr Reagan has had a problem delegating authority and has tended to operate on his own The aide said that in a Presidential race this could certainly hurt Mr Doles prospects Short Period for Selections What makes organization nationally as well as in Iowa especially significant in 1988 is the early concentration of primaries and caucuses From Feb 8 the date of the Iowa caucuses to March 8 nearly half the delegates to both parties national conventions will be chosen According to Republicans here the Kemp Bush and Dole Presidential campaigns none of which have been formally announced will open offices as exploratory committees in Des Moines in the next few months Mr Dole plans to name as his cochairmen Barbara Grassley the wife of Senator Charles E Grassley and Beverly Tauke the wife of Representative Tom Tauke No one has yet been selected to run the Dole campaign here said Mr Doles aides Even Mr Doles supporters concede he cannot match the Bush organization in Iowa Mr Bush who defeated Mr Reagan in the 1980 Republican Presidential caucuses here has kept his organization intact since then His chairman George W Wittgraf a lawyer from Cherokee Iowa who played the same role in 1980 said Yes we have a nucleus all across the state and we will certainly attempt to involve them once again Another prominent Bush aide here Sally Novetzke who recently resigned as state Republican chairman to work on the Vice Presidents campaign said in essence that the newspaper poll showing Mr Dole ahead was probably a blessing for the Bush effort Were saying Bob Dole is ahead now she observed You always want someone else to be frontrunner You do You just do You dont want to be a frontrunner like Walter Mondale If youre in second place well it gets the adrenalin pumping Mr Bond Mr Bushs national political director said Now that Bob Dole is the frontrunner in Iowa he has a lot to answer for For one thing hes the point man for the Administration on the budget specifically the agricultural budget which is a tough and thorny issue To Republicans here the third key Presidential hopeful Mr Kemp shows signs of forging a strong organization with support from conservatives antiabortion groups and perhaps most significant young people in their teens and 20s

PREGNANCY CENTERS: ANTI-ABORTION ROLE CHALLENGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/nyregion/pregnancy-centers-anti-abortion-role-challenged.html,The advertisement in the Yellow Pages asked if she was thinking of an abortion which the schoolteacher was So she visited the AAA Pregnancy Problem center in Brooklyn where a counselor advocated child birth and chastity with pamphlets and pictures to buttress the appeal I was looking for a referral to an abortion clinic and nothing in the ad or on the phone indicated to me that this wasnt just what I was looking for said the 31yearold unmarried woman who agreed to an interview on the condition that she not be identified Instead I walked into a sermon a speech about how some things are just meant to be that you never know how things will turn out that Leonardo da Vinci was illegitimate The center at 6802 Fifth Avenue in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn is one of three in New York City that are the subject of a nearly completed investigation by State Attorney General Robert Abrams who is expected to file a suit soon in State Supreme Court charging deceptive advertising Officials in the Attorney Generals office say the case is built on affidavits from unwitting consumers like the Brooklyn schoolteacher and women who made undercover visits to the centers some gathering information for advocacy groups such as Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women Several of these women brought borrowed positive urine samples to guarantee that they heard the full antiabortion presentation A Combustible Issue Fourteen years after the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion the issue remains as combustible as dry kindling and such centers have become the focus of heated criticism and legal challenge here and around the country The three New York centers  the other two both in Manhattan are Options at 80 Fifth Avenue and Manhattan Pregnancy Services at 210 East 23d Street  were also investigated by the citys Health Department and fined last month for running unlicensed clinical laboratories All three are affiliated with the Pearson Foundation a St Louis organization founded in 1969 to assist local groups setting up antiabortion counseling centers The foundation provides training sessions slide shows pamphlets discounted video equipment and kits to perform urine tests and a manual entitled How to Start and Operate Your Own ProLife Outreach Crisis Pregnancy Center The centers have been called deceptive by the Texas Attorney General the North Dakota Supreme Court the Federal Centers for Disease Control the National Organization for Women Planned Parenthood and the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Even groups vigorously opposed to abortion  including Birthright a chain of similar counseling centers  have objected to the Pearson Foundation approach Government officials investigating the centers stress that their concern is deception not support for or opposition to abortion Our position is not that they cant attempt to talk people out of abortion said Peter Bienstock the chief of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau in the State Attorney Generals office Our position is they cant do that if they entice people by misrepresentation Officials at the Pearson Foundation and at the local centers declined requests for interviews Were so busy its hard to find time said J Michael Byers the business manager at the foundation The mother and the baby are our work  or our apostolate as we like to call it Omission of Information In previous published interviews Robert J Pearson a home builder and the groups founder has made it clear that he believes omission of information is justified in pursuit of his cause Were just not saying what we dont do Mr Pearson a Roman Catholic has said A car dealer when hes advertising does not list the things his auto wont do So why should we say we dont do abortions The Pearson manual has been described by lawenforcement officials around the country as a 93page guidebook of ways to mislead consumers The manual urges local operators to use neutral advertising to seek listings in the Yellow Pages telephone directory alongside abortion clinics and to adopt dual names one to draw abortionbound women and one to attract donations from people against abortion Referring to the centers pregnancy tests the same sort available at a drugstore the manual suggests Tell her its a refined form of the old rabbit test This usually satisfies them At no time do you need to tell them what youre doing Of telephone calls from people asking for abortion services the manual says Remember there is nothing wrong or dishonest if you dont want to answer a question that may reveal your prolife position by changing the callers train of thought by asking a question in return As for the advertisements they are vague rather than overtly erroneous According to several lawyers specializing in consumer fraud statutes on consumer fraud prohibit advertising that has the capacity to deceive even if it is literally true The court is looking to protect not the savvy hip consumer but the unthinking credulous consumer said Andrea Levine an assistant attorney general in New York States Consumer Frauds Bureau Information From Ads Apart from the central misunderstanding about whether the centers perform abortions or make referrals the women who have visited them cite the following information in advertisements in the 1986 issue of the Nynex Yellow Pages  The Options centers advertisment promises birth control information Nancy Weinstock a NOW volunteer visited the center last May and according to notes she took immediately afterward was told birth control doesnt work because Mother Nature doesnt intend our bodies to be controlled The Pearson manual states Never counsel for contraception  Advertisements for the two Manhattan centers promise financial assistance According to Amy Sutnick a Planned Parenthood employee who visited both centers such aid consisted of suggestions that she apply for welfare benefits and register with a temporary employment agency  All three centers advertise free pregnancy tests Since the City Health Department levied its fines which ranged from 750 to 4000 it is unclear whether tests are still being processed on the premises At the time of Ms Weinstocks visit she said she was told that urine and blood tests were identical and that a urine sample did not need to be taken the first thing in the morning Both pieces of information are incorrect  The Manhattan Pregnancy Services advertisement offers accurate abortion information Ms Sutnick of Planned Parenthood said the slide show that she saw there  presented at all three centers while women await test results  was filled with statistics about the dangers of abortion that have been disputed by the Centers for Disease Control The 27minute slide show called Caring includes many pictures of bloody fetuses in waste cans and one of a gurney carrying a woman who is apparently dead and is covered by a sheet It ends by comparing abortion to the final solution At least one of the investigators visits to the centers was taperecorded said Carolyn Rea the coordinator of NOWs Reproductive Rights Committee The woman who went in Ms Rea said on the tape you can hear her crying
RALLY AGAINST ABORTION HEARS PLEDGE OF SUPPORT BY REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/us/rally-against-abortion-hears-pledge-of-support-by-reagan.html,President Reagan pledged his continued support to thousands of people rallying here today to protest abortion saying he would work with them to overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and to end this national tragedy Thank you for your commitment to the right to life of Americas unborn children the President said in comments delivered by telephone over a sound system speaker to the protesters gathered on the Ellipse behind the White House Today you remind all of us that abortion is not a harmless medical procedure but the taking of a life of a living human being An estimated 5000 demonstrators marched through a driving snowstorm to the Supreme Court today to mark the 14th anniversary of Roe vs Wade the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion They carried such signs as Stop Unborn Child Abuse and Equal Rights for Unborn Women and they heard Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina describe abortion as an American holocaust But at a news conference this morning supporters of legalized abortion declared that political momentum had turned their way The antiabortion minority has failed now in every democratic institution in America in the courts in Congress in state legislatures and on state ballot measures said Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League The antiabortion minoritys smoke and mirrors are gone Today prochoice forces control the agenda Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women declared We know where people stand on this issue They are for keeping it legal The antiabortion march beginning on the Ellipse and proceeding to the Capitol and the Supreme Court has become an annual event In his comments Mr Reagan struck an optimistic note for the antiabortion movement Weve worked together to restrict the use of Federal funds to perform abortion he said Weve denied Government funds to organizations overseas that perform or promote abortion The protesters of abortion many of whom began the day delivering red roses and lobbying their Congressmen also heard from Representative Jack Kemp the Republican Presidential hopeful from upstate New York who said that the fight against abortion was a human rights cause Tonight John Cardinal OConnor of New York was honored at a March for Life dinner here for his leadership on abortion issues The struggle is so crucial Cardinal OConnor told his audience I have frequently been accused of being a singleissue bishop I accept the accusation he said to heavy applause The issue is life
"America, the U.N. and China's Family Planning",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/24/opinion/america-the-un-and-china-s-family-planning.html,In November I led a Congressional delegation to China to study Chinas family planning program and to discuss with Chinese officials charges that the Government was using coercion and forced abortion to reduce the population growth rate The coercion charges made by Administration conservatives have poisoned the atmosphere of support in America for international family planning programs and have prompted Washington to withdraw financial support from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Yet we should all realize that if China had not instituted a comprehensive family planning effort in the 1960s including the controversial one child per family policy unchecked population growth stimulated in part by improved child health care and the accompanying reduction in maternal and child deaths would have pushed the population by the year 2025 to an estimated 52 billion a sum far exceeding todays total world population China recognized the horrifying effects of a population explosion caused by an average six child family and set in motion a family planning program that touches every facet of life It stresses family planning as the means to improve the quality of family and national life through advances in education health care diet productivity and environmental protection Chinas approach to family planning may seem foreign to Western traditions but that is natural considering that Chinas whole culture is vastly different from ours The Chinese program relies on an incessant drumbeat of persuasion and peer pressure which is undergirded by individuals sense of responsibility to society and family which supersedes any perception they may have of their own personal rights During our 10 days in China my colleagues and I found that the much publicized one child policy was not what it seemed The national average is actually 22 children per family with the strongest adherence to the one child policy occurring in urban areas where housing is in short supply The policy is far less rigid in the rural areas where 80 percent of Chinese reside and last year nearly 50 percent of the births in China were in families that already had one child Local officials who run the family planning program in the field are given flexibility Official policy recognizes practical difficulties as justification for sanctioning second children  for example when a first child is mentally or physically handicapped or is female or when the father is a disabled serviceman or when both parents are single children Officials indicated that the one child policy may be relaxed further perhaps by 1990 or 2000 If the current birth rate of 22 children per family can be maintained China can meet its goal of not exceeding 12 billion people by the year 2000 As for coercion the delegation not only found that it is condemned by officials but also that the Government had severely penalized local officials who violated official policy Infanticide is illegal and violators face prison Chinese officials readily admitted that some overzealous local officers went off the deep end and practiced coercion when the one child policy was first implemented in 1980 But they say and Western observers agree that such instances are increasingly infrequent and that the uproar in the Western media focused Government attention on the problem The United Nations Fund for Population Activities spends 10 million a year in China an amount equal to less than 1 percent of Chinas own 1 billion annual commitment to family planning The funds China program involves expert assistance in training and introduction of the full array of contraceptive technology The agencys role is helpful at the margins but is not a necessity particularly as the Chinese program matures Even so antiabortion zealots in our Government have successfully blocked American contributions to the fund and have irritated relations with China by misapplication of a Federal law that prohibits contributions to any agency involved in the management of a coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization program The funds role in Chinas family planning program is not a management role The Administration should set aside its ideological interpretation of the law administer the law objectively and follow Congresss legislative intent in an intelligent manner The United Nations agency needs the estimated 36 million that the United States will withhold this year  not for the Chinese effort but to fund programs to promote family planning and maternal and child health services in the poor nations of subSaharan Africa Bangladesh and Haiti where rampant population growth is causing devastating poverty disease and starvation and wrecking prospects for development For years the United States was recognized as the global leader in the promotion of humane family planning programs We should now reclaim that role
O'CONNOR SAYS HE'LL DROP SOME FOSTER-CARE PACTS WITH CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/24/nyregion/o-connor-says-he-ll-drop-some-foster-care-pacts-with-city.html,John Cardinal OConnor said in Washington Thursday night that he had decided to discontinue some of the foster care that his archdiocese provides to children in New York City rather than comply with a recent court stipulation In very strong language the Cardinal criticized the part of the agreement that says foster children must have meaningful access to familyplanning information services and counseling and he indicated that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York would not renew fostercare contracts it has with the city I have chosen to reject the contracts rather than to accept this agreement the Cardinal told members of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund an antiabortion group Noting that giving up the city contracts would cost the archdiocese a great deal of government financing the Cardinal said he would accept the loss We will lose in the neighborhood of 100 million a year he said 100 million is not worth one baby Group Care Is at Issue About 4000 of the citys 17000 foster children are in Catholic agencies that come under the auspices of the New York archdiocese and about 60 percent of the 4000 are cared for in group homes The rest are living with foster parents It is the group care that is at issue The archdiocese has no plans to stop placing children in individual homes city and church officials have indicated The Cardinals spokesman Msgr Peter Finn said yesterday that to his knowledge no final decision had been made about the contracts which expire June 30 and he emphasized that negotiations are continuing between the city and the church But city officials who have been dealing with the situation for months said yesterday that while negotiations are indeed continuing the tone and direction of the talks strongly suggest that the archdiocese will cut back on its fostercare services At issue now they indicated is not whether the archdiocese will discontinue contracts but to what degree Members of nonprofit groups that support the stipulation have said they do not believe the archdiocese will discontinue any contracts and suggest that the church is trying to pressure the city  already having trouble handling a dramatic increase in the number of fostercare children  into finding a compromise that would weaken the agreement Koch administration officials and the Mayor dispute that interpretation Mr Koch said in a recent interview that he not only believes the churchs reaction but also agrees with it He calls the stipulation bad and said the city agreed to it only to avoid a court fight that could have led to a ban on religious agencies providing any publicly financed foster care At the dinner in his honor at the HyattRegency Hotel on Capitol Hill Cardinal OConnor warned that the court agreement set what he saw as a dangerous precedent Know that what has just occurred in the city of New York will now sweep the country he said Every organization will be vulnerable Referring to the American Civil Liberties Union which filed the lawsuit that led to the court agreement he opposes the Cardinal said Will the ACLU stop with child care institutions We expect nursing homes to be next and then our hospitals How long can we fight the legal battle that already has cost us a very substantial fortune Order Can Be Appealed That suggests the archdiocese will not appeal the stipulation approved Oct 8 by Judge Robert J Ward of Federal District Court in Manhattan Once the judge signs the stipulation making it an order of the court  it can be appealed within 30 days The judge is expected to act by early next month So far none of the religious fostercare agencies affected by the agreement have said whether they plan to appeal The court stipulation settled a 13yearold lawsuit that challenged the citys method of placing fostercare children in agencies on the basis of religion Catholic children were placed with Catholic agencies Jewish children with Jewish agencies and so on The suit charged that black children who are Protestant were suffering discrimination Under the settlement the city has agreed to place children in fostercare agencies without regard to race or religion The stipulation stated that fostercare agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care It also states that the agencies cannot display excessive religious symbols cannot require children to attend religious services and that each agency must provide comparable opportunities for children to practice their religions Argument on Religious Freedom The archdiocese objects to the stipulation in general on the grounds that it impinges on the churchs freedom But church officials are most concerned about that part of the agreement that  when translated from its legal language  means that children in fostercare agencies must be given access to contraception and abortion services Under State and Federal laws and regulations teenagers receiving public assistance  which includes all children in foster care  cannot be deprived of contraception and abortion services The religious agencies are not required to provide those services themselves They are required however to allow children to get the services elsewhere from family planning agencies for instance Koch administration officials have estimated that the archdiocese would if it discontinued its group care contracts lose between 50 million and 60 million in Federal State and city funds not 100 million as the Cardinal said If the archdiocese does not renew its group care contracts the city will have to turn to other agencies or provide the foster care directly Officials of the citys childrens services agency have come up with contingency plans but nothing formal has yet been approved by the Koch administration

WASHINGTON TALK; ABORTION FOES PONDER SETBACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/26/us/washington-talk-abortion-foes-ponder-setbacks.html,The snow was so heavy Thursday that many protesters had difficulty finding the rally wandering across the Ellipse until they finally saw off on the white horizon a small cluster of placards and banners It was the 14th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and once again Nellie Gray organizer of the annual March for Life was leading a protest against the High Court The police estimated the size of the crowd at 5000 as against 36000 the year before and 70000 the year before that The weather for this years March for Life traditionally one of the most visible events of the year for abortion protesters was only the latest in a series of frustrations for that movement in the view of some analysts and participants What Happened In recent days as both sides of this exceptionally bitter debate looked back on the anniversary of Roe v Wade the supporters of legalized abortion voiced a new confidence that the political tide had turned their way while antiabortion leaders acknowledged that they faced difficult days Central to these assessments were the 1986 election results which saw the Democrats regain control of the Senate as well as the defeat of antiabortion ballot measures in four states What happened asked David N OSteen executive director of the National Right to Life Committee in a review of the November elections issued by the group last week Mr OSteen went on to argue that the picture was not as bad as it seemed for his movement saying that antiabortion voters had affected several races last November But he and other leaders acknowledged that the loss of a Republican majority in the Senate which included the defeat of some reliable antiabortion votes was a setback This means that prolife groups will have their hands full in the Senate during 1987 defending past gains and seeking to block the passage of new proabortion legislation Douglas Johnson the Right to Life Committees legislative director predicted But some political analysts see a deeper frustration afflicting the movement which has grown increasingly identified with the Republican Party in recent years For six years they say the movement has had a man in the White House who expresses great sympathy for its cause President Reagan warmly addressed the abortion foes gathered on the Ellipse last week in remarks delivered by telephone hailing their commitment and pledging his continuing support Rhetoric but Not Action But the clock is winding down on the Reagan Presidency and while the antiabortion movement has had some successes mostly in the restriction of funds for abortionrelated programs it finds much of its agenda still unfulfilled Some of the prolife movement definitely feels that the Administration has given them rhetoric but not action said Paul Weyrich a conservative strategist Richard Viguerie another conservative argued that this feeling was not confined to the antiabortion movement I think theres a frustration among all of the conservatives whether its those concerned about prolife or national defense or economic issues Some analysts argue that this frustration has cost the abortion issue some of its political power You had the decade from the mid70s to the mid80s where it had a cutting edge said Kevin Phillips a Republican political strategist It mobilized people who were being taken out of the Democratic coalition on religious and social issues But such issues he said lose some of their cutting edge when weve had the most conservative President in memory in the White House stating his agreement on these issues and being unable to do anything about it Role in 1988 Campaign Nevertheless the abortion issue will continue to be important particularly in the Republican Presidential nominating process according to those who follow politics closely At last years National Right to Life Convention three Republican Presidential aspirants were speakers And John Buckley aide to Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York one of those hopefuls said Members of the prolife movement are some of the most deeply committed political activists in the political process Mr Buckley noted that some of the states with early nominating contests including Iowa and New Hampshire had strong antiabortion movements And he argued Its clear that the Republican primary voter is very strongly a prolife voter Over the next two years much of the attention on both sides of the abortion debate will be focused on the composition of the Supreme Court Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League stood with other supporters of legalized abortion last Thursday at a news conference to mark the anniversary of Roe v Wade She said she was confident of prevailing in the political realm but she voiced concern that the Supreme Court majority in support of the 1973 decision had narrowed Mr Johnson of the Right to Life Committee said that while his organization had not given up on seeking a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion its clear that in the years immediately ahead the prospects for reversal of Roe v Wade lie in a change of membership on the Supreme Court
METRO DATELINES; Cardinal Assesses Foster-Care Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/26/nyregion/metro-datelines-cardinal-assesses-foster-care-dispute.html,The door is always open to a settlement in the continuing dispute between the Roman Catholic Archdiocese and New York City over fostercare programs John Cardinal OConnor said yesterday But he said the archdiocese would not compromise in its opposition to providing familyplanning information to youngsters in the program The familyplanning provision which requires that certain fostercare programs provide youngsters with contraception and abortion counseling is included in a court stipulation already agreed to by the city The Archdiocese of New York runs programs for 4000 of the citys 17000 fostercare children The Cardinal said he would discontinue some of the programs  and forgo 100 million in city contracts rather than run them in accordance with the stipulation Mayor Koch has called the court stipulation bad and has said that the city agreed to it only to avoid a court fight that could lead to a ban on the involvement of religious agencies in such programs The door is always open when you have a mayor who publicly says that the stipulation is wrong the Cardinal said after mass yesterday at St Patricks Cathedral It would be inappropriate for me to say that they couldnt come up with something

"ECHO OF CALMER TIMES; REJECTING CALL FOR 'FIGHTING SPEECH,' REAGAN URGES UNITY AND DRAWS ON THEMES OF PAST",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/28/us/echo-calmer-times-rejecting-call-for-fighting-speech-reagan-urges-unity-draws.html,President Reagan delivered a State of the Union Message tonight that he could have delivered with only modest changes if his party had won the Senate elections last November and if the IranNicaragua controversy had never developed Sensing that Mr Reagan had been weakened by the Republicans loss of the Senate the uproar over arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some of the profits to the Nicaraguan rebels many of his supporters had hoped that the President would go to Capitol Hill with blood in his eye and make a fighting speech in the words of Senator William L Armstrong Republican of Colorado But Mr Reagan chose not to follow that advice Instead he appealed for cooperation by Congressional Democrats made a brief and mildly phrased reference to the arms controversy listed a series of goals that he had mentioned in other such speeches and moved on to a coda built around the sovereignty of the people under the American Constitution which is 200 years old this year The United States he said quoting Benjamin Franklin is a rising and not a setting sun It was a typical Reagan rhetorical device reminiscent of his 1984 campaign theme its morning in America  and designed perhaps to suggest that he himself was not prepared quite yet despite his problems to ride into the political sunset Mr Reagan looked fit and confident and he sounded thoroughly in command of his material except toward the end when his voice grew quite raspy and he briefly lost his rhetorical rhythm His performance may have gone some way toward achieving his goal of seeming to take charge His entrance was welcomed warmly on both sides of the aisle But with the exception of the bipartisan applause that greeted the Presidents declaration that the Federal deficit is outrageous the subsequent cheers all came from the outnumbered Republican contingent The Democrats no longer fear Mr Reagans electoral power and that almost certainly portends two years of strife between the White House and Capitol Hill despite the Presidents assertion that the nation must not become obsessed with failure and his warning that both the nation and the world would be watching to see if we go forward in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us There was ample evidence in his speech that the furor surrounding the Iranian arms deal as well as other factors have stymied the White House Mr Reagan was unable because of internal dissension for example to provide details of what is emerging as his single major new domestic policy initiative catastrophic health insurance Struggle Within Administration According to White House officials the speech as delivered was the result of a struggle between the pragmatists and the ideologues in the Reagan inner circle who have clashed so often in the past The officials said that neither of the two original drafts  a hardline version prepared by Patrick J Buchanan the White House communications director and a more lyrical less confrontational version prepared by Kenneth Khachigian a former speechwriter who now undertakes special projects had proved acceptable to Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff He had Dennis Thomas his chief aide prepare a third version But in the end Nancy Reagan who preferred the version prepared by Mr Khachigian prevailed the officials said Mr Regan the chief of staff had wanted something dramatically different that would divert attention from the arms controversy He was said by his associates to have bitterly opposed the reiteration of a series of objectives from the first six years of the Reagan Presidency with little chance of winning Congressional approval such as a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and a move to give the President the right to veto individual budget items But he was unable to put his view across even though he is believed to be in a much stronger position now than he was a month ago when many Reagan supporters were calling for his ouster Nor was Mr Buchanan able to get into the speech any stirring conservative call to arms The President promised to keep pressing for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels and urged that officially sanctioned prayer in schools be legalized but he said nothing about outlawing abortion and noticeably refrained from advocating early deployment of weapons developed under his proposal for an program to shoot down attacking missiles Language of Earlier Addresses In a number of passages his language was almost identical to that which he had used in earlier State of the Union Messages But Mr Reagan is seen differently by the electorate to which he spoke on television tonight than at any other time in his Presidency Although he asserted that we have done much these past years to restore our defenses our alliances and our leadership in the world a New York TimesCBS News Poll of 1509 voters taken between Jan 18 and 21 indicated that the public has strong doubts on that point Asked whether the United States was more respected in the world now than when Mr Reagan became President only 27 percent said yes 32 percent said no and 38 percent said they saw no major change The President urged in effect that the nation put the IranNicaragua affair to one side and work toward the successes of the future But in the poll 41 percent said they considered the crisis as serious as the Watergate affair which cost Richard M Nixon the Presidency Mr Reagan cited James Monroe Franklin D Roosevelt Harry S Truman and John F Kennedy in support of his antiCommunist policy in Central America but 60 percent of the respondents in the poll disapproved and only 28 percent approved of sending military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels Since November Mr Reagan has seemed to be on the defensive and his prostate surgery earlier this month kept him out of the public eye for an unusually long period People were anxious as Mr Khachigian himself said a few days ago to see how the wizard is doing The consensus tonight among politicians in both parties was that the President had not regained the initiative and if that proves true the outlook is for an even more rapid ebbing of the Administrations power than is customary in the final two years of a twoterm Presidency like that of Mr Reagan

WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Legal Foundation Troubles,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/31/us/washington-talk-briefing-legal-foundation-troubles.html,Dan Burt president of the the Capital Legal Foundation has turned in his resignation amid indications that support for such conservative legal foundations is flagging Theres no question about that said Mr Burt who achieved a high public profile as the chief lawyer for Gen William C Westmoreland in his libel suit against CBS What we have seen in the past year not just us is that the more reflective conservative groups have had real funding problems Mr Burt said declining revenue from conservative corporate donors resulted from a perception that their work has been done in the economy and that conservative emphasis was now on emotional issues such as abortion and foreign policy notably in Central America Mr Burt who has been president of the nonprofit foundation for six years said the progress of deregulation in the Reagan Administration was paradoxically largely responsible for the decline of support for organizations like his There is a lot less regulation and a lot of what is left is transferred to the states he said Despite his resignation and despite cutbacks in the foundations legal staff and a move to smaller quarters Mr Burt said Were not out of business The Capital Legal Foundations economic problems are shared by similar freemarketoriented legal groups that sprung up in the 1970s Such problems have been felt for instance at the Coloradobased Mountain States Legal Foundation founded with oil money in 1977 to combat environmental restrictions and headed by James G Watt before he became President Reagans first Interior Secretary And on the West Coast the Pacific Legal Foundation recently closed its Washington office
2 ADMINISTRATION LEADERS AGREE ON AIDS EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/31/us/2-administration-leaders-agree-on-aids-education.html,Education Secretary William J Bennett and Surgeon General C Everett Koop in a move to play down their differences on AIDS education today released a joint statement asserting that young people should be taught that sexual abstinence is safest Dr Koop in a telephone interview said he and Mr Bennett had agreed to draft the statement to clarify their positions and to clear up the perception that there was a great gulf between us which was not the case The Surgeon General said exaggerated press reports had contributed to the misperception that he had strong differences with Mr Bennett In the past Dr Koop has publicly advocated that children be taught about AIDS prevention as early as possible while Mr Bennett has argued for waiting until at least the eighth grade and for a policy of sexual restraint The statement which seeks a common ground between the two officials positions said education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be based on the same principles of abstinence that should form the foundation of all sex education With the appropriate involvement and approval of parents and the local community schools should help teach young people about the danger of AIDS the statement says But an AIDS education that accepts childrens sexual activity as inevitable and focuses only on safe sex will be at best ineffectual at worst itself a cause of serious harm The statement adds Young people should be taught that the best precaution is abstinence until it is possible to establish a mutually faithful monogamous relationship AIDS Epidemic Feared In a speech Thursday Dr Otis R Bowen Secretary of Health and Human Services predicted that a worldwide AIDS epidemic would become so serious that it would dwarf earlier medical disasters such as the Black Plague smallpox and typhoid If we cant make progress we face the dreadful prospect of a worldwide death toll in the tens of millions a decade from now Dr Bowen said of the disease which destroys the bodys immune system leaving the victim vulnerable to a variety of fatal illnesses He said at least 270000 cases of AIDS were expected in this country in the next five years with more than 10 percent of them involving heterosexuals The statement by Mr Bennett and Dr Koop represents the latest airing of views in a growing national debate about sex education AIDS and teenage pregnancy Some experts including researchers for the National Research Council the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences have concluded that the scope of these problems demands aggressive solutions including better sex education more readily available contraceptives and access to abortion for teenagers But conservatives such as Mr Bennett have maintained that the answer to problems attributed to greater and earlier sexual freedom depend on stressing values and urging sexual restraint for teenagers not on making contraceptives more accessible Indeed conservatives have criticized Dr Koop for a report on AIDS he issued last October as being too accepting of sexual activity on the part of young people Dr Koop maintained that AIDS education should begin at the lowest grade possible Abstinence or a monogamous relationship represent the best protection against infection he said Barring that Dr Koop called for using condoms Those recommendations became the subject of debate in two recent meetings of the Presidents Domestic Policy Council where Mr Bennetts deputy Gary L Bauer Under Secretary of Education argued that abstinence not protection should be the foundation of AIDS education Mr Bauer was named today as the Presidents domestic policy adviser Mr Bennett made the same point in an interview last week It sends the wrong message to children he said to advise them to protect themselves from the disease by limiting the number of their sexual partners or by using condoms As a parent Mr Bennett said he would oppose AIDS education being offered before the eighth or ninth grade And he said that given the morally ambiguous materials used in sex education classes he would probably prefer to have the schools leave his childs AIDS education to him A senior Education Department official said today that any remaining differences between Mr Bennett and Dr Koop related to the age at which AIDS education should begin and the emphasis to be placed on safe sexual practices as opposed to sexual restraint In discussing those differences today Dr Koop said the joint statement did not really represent any change of position for him He said that in advocating AIDS education at an early age he always regarded developmental age as more significant than chronological age And the joint statement does not mention means of protection The joint statement indicates that we agree as far as we decided to discuss the matter Dr Koop said Im already on record as saying that if youre foolish enough not to accept the recommendations of the Surgeon Generals report regarding the importance of abstaining and monogamy then at least protect yourself and your partner he said Conservatives Pleased Jerry Regier president of the Family Research Council a conservative social policy research organization said today that some conservatives had been outraged by Dr Koops AIDS report Mr Regier said he totally approved however of the joint statement issued today with its emphases on parental involvement and teaching values Robert L Bartleson executive director of the United Families Foundation a conservative profamily research organization said that he absolutely supported the statement Its a pleasant surprise to have Koop reverse his position like that he said Id like to think some of our criticism was helpful in getting him to change his position
Guilt and Mr. Meese,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/31/opinion/guilt-and-mr-meese.html,Last February the Justice Departments Office of Legal Policy sent a 128page report to Attorney General Edwin Meese urging him to ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1966 Miranda v Arizona decision Thats the famous decision that made confessions inadmissible as evidence unless an accused person has been warned by police of the right to silence and to a lawyer and waived it Overruling Miranda the report said would be among the most important achievements of this Administration  indeed of any Administration It is difficult to see how we could fail in making our case We have a uniquely favorable set of circumstances  several decisions by the Supreme Court holding in effect that Miranda is unsound in principle What happened next illustrates why it is hard to take Mr Meese seriously as a legal strategist much less a constitutional scholar In March the high court in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day OConnor an appointee of President Reagan had this to say about Miranda The decision as written strikes the proper balance between societys legitimate law enforcement interests and the protection of the defendants Fifth Amendment rights She was joined by five Justices  White Blackmun Powell Rehnquist and Burger then Chief Justice  who had bitterly criticized Miranda for years Like many police departments across the nation those Justices seem to have made their peace with the ruling though they would strongly oppose extending it What did Mr Meese do with his aides report He held it for nearly a year and last week released it The document included an addendum mentioning the March decision but not Justice OConnors telling phrase about proper balance For whose benefit is all this posturing When Mr Meese asked the Supreme Court to overrule the Roe v Wade abortion decision the justices ignored him When he describes as intellectually shaky the Courts application 62 years ago of the Bill of Rights to the states he inspires mostly snickers He produces treatises complaining that Chief Justice Marshall skewed the Constitutions federalist design None of Mr Meeses attempts at scholarship achieve the eloquence of his unguarded response when an interviewer asked Why shouldnt people have the protections of the Miranda warnings Suspects who are innocent of crime should But the thing is you dont have many suspects who are innocent of crime Thats contradictory If a person is innocent of a crime then he is not a suspect In other words guilty until proven guilty
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO DISLIKE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/01/world/something-for-everyone-to-dislike.html,On Monday 23 million registered voters are scheduled to respond yes or no to a question that boils down to this Is the Philippines better off with a flawed constitution or no constitution at all Most analysts here expect the constitution to be approved but they say anything less than an overwhelming approval  generally seen as about 65 percent in favor  would be taken as a vote of no confidence in President Corazon C Aquino The proposed 24000word charter produced by a 48member commission in 132 days last year is at the same time detailed and ambiguous and it contains something for almost everyone to oppose But in the highly charged and unstable political environment it is one brief transitory provision that will be the focus for most voters the endorsement of a sixyear term for Mrs Aquino until June 30 1992 May Soon Need Amendments Even its backers acknowledge that few voters have read the huge document and that if they did they would agree that almost as soon as it is adopted it may need to be amended But they argue that the alternative would be chaos and that the country would be plunged again into a struggle for succession Since the constitution has become so closely identified with Mrs Aquino the vote has turned into a test of her popularity five days short of a year after the election in which she challenged President Ferdinand E Marcos Opponents say they are prepared to demand a new election if the plebiscite indicates that Mrs Aquino has lost the backing of the nation If it is approved the constitution would give her Government the legal basis it abandoned in March when the President abolished the 1973 charter under which she was elected Since then she has headed what she calls a revolutionary Government under a temporary freedom constitution Kind of Deadline for Marcos For this reason Monday is seen as something as a deadline for the legalistic Mr Marcos adding credence to reports that he intended to return to the Philippines this week While confirming her in office the constitution would diminish Mrs Aquinos influence by paving the way for legislative elections and by reducing some of the powers of the presidency In the shadow of the Marcos era the constitutions drafters wrote several provisions to limit presidential powers holding the chief executive to a single sixyear term banning close relatives of the President from Government posts and restricting the Presidents appointive powers The charter would require congressional review of any imposition of martial law and would allow judicial review of presidential decrees Mrs Aquinos opponents are already preparing to challenge her in legislative elections which would be held May 11 if the constitution is approved Indeed their vigorous drive against the constitution is seen in part as a preparation for that campaign and for the local elections that will follow in August Some political analysts see a strong possibility that the opposition may dominate the lower house and even the Senate whose members will be elected on a nationwide ballot Essentially Centrist Charter In essence the constitution is a centrist endorsement of civil rights balance of powers respect for property and a reduction in the influence of the presidency Based on the American system of checks and balances it mandates an independent judiciary and a legislature of a 24member Senate and a 250member House of Representatives But its 18 articles subdivided into 305 sections go well beyond the usual bounds of a constitution for example decreeing state promotion of sports and banning abortion and child abuse It requires the Government to assign the highest possible budgetary priority to education It invites future battles over such issues as Moslem autonomy which it requires in limited degree and the presence of American military bases once the agreement on them expires in 1992 The charter requires that any new agreement on the bases be ratified by a twothirds vote in the Senate almost assuring a divisive debate Would Bar Nuclear Weapons And its framers included an article barring nuclear weapons except as consistent with national interest This provision could negate the usefulness of the bases to the United States The constitution is so wideranging that in the armed forces for example some soldiers are opposing it because it abolishes the national police force while others support it because they expect it to mean higher salaries free uniforms better housing and health care and guaranteed retirement benefits It also calls for land redistribution preferential use of Filipino labor and materials incentives to needed investments security of tenure for workers and progressive income taxes

IRELAND HAS HER MADNESS STILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/01/books/ireland-has-her-madness-still.html,NO COUNTRY FOR YOUNG MEN By Julia OFaolain 369 pp New York Carroll  Graf 1950 THE Irishborn Julia OFaolain is well regarded for her short stories and for novels like Woman in the Wall and The Obedient Wife No Country for Young Men however is a quantum jump toward excellence of a much higher level The novel is a stunning performance There is something exhilarating in seeing a talented writer really hit her stride using everything she knows Not that this is a cheerful book It is bitter The title by altering a famous Yeats line  That is no country for old men  aligns the mood of the novel with Joyces drastic epigram Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow This dark view is fully supported in the story where young men are done to death or else survive only to turn awful and conspiratorial by middle age owing to what still goes by the name of the Irish national question It seems that politics is to blame That sounds like Joyce also except that Joyce or rather Mr Deasy in Ulysses used the word history The Irish history in this novel is mainly in the treaty and civil war period 192124 and a halfcentury later when civil strife has broken out again at least in the North Poorly conceived IrishAmerican support and intervention come into it at both times In an extraordinary structural tour de force the novel maintains a dual focus always keeping in view the still unsolved murder in 1922 of a young American Sparky Driscoll who had been in Ireland as an observer for IrishAmerican groups eager to support the new state The catastrophic climax comes when another young IrishAmerican a Californian who has come to Dublin in the early 1970s to write a screenplay about the same Sparky Driscoll and to cheer on the new IRA fighting in the North is targeted for elimination because he has blundered into the middle of a new Irish conspiracy closely resembling the one that had proved so lethal to Driscoll When I add that the conspirators are blood kin and offspring of the bad people mixed up in Sparkys murder  the sole witness of that earlier crime incidentally is still around 50 years later  the reader will grasp how tightly wound are the books structural design and plot There is a resemblance to those famous interlacings and knottings along the margins and on the capital pages of the Book of Kells An important secondary theme  bitterness again  is the oppression and unequal status of Irish women a condition crossing all classes of society There is GreatAunt Judith OMalley banished for life to a secluded order of nuns by her brotherinlaw the antitreaty politician Owen after her psychotic breakdown When she goes on furlough to the home of Grainne her grandniece by marriage she appears as a sort of living time capsule constantly confusing what happened a halfcentury before with what is going on in the present Having a mad nun on the premises suggests Gothic melodrama but let us remember that the great Dublin novelist Charles Robert Maturin writing about 1818 proclaimed Ireland because of her distressed political and social condition the country where Gothic melodrama is a daily occurrence In the final disposition of Judiths case one sees just how devastating to a society the mistreatment of women the misuse of their energies and gifts really is Grainne at 33 would seem to be a new type as she acts free of the influence of church and convent plunges into a passionate sexual affair with the American film maker and looks forward to walking out of her deteriorated marriage even if it will distress her boozy husband and cause her 14yearold son Cormac to scorn her But then she is reeled in by her cousin Owen Roe a loathsome Dublin politico who is on the qui vive for Provo terrorists and not about to let any woman spoil his run up to power with scandalous goingson In this novel the same oppressions and betrayals repeat themselves and family is fate or rather a fatal trap The interstices of the book are crammed with fascinating material There is Patsy Flynn an exconvict and exIRA man oldstyle He is a ratlike little man celibate who looks after the local youth club and feeds the minds of boys like Cormac on the poisonous myth of physical force There is a wonderful scene comic and terrible in which a shellshocked priest just back from the Western Front in the First World War addressing an audience of convent girls keeps breaking down and blubbering as he tries to convey his sense  it is an appalling one  of their utter purity and virginity And there is Grainnes sharp and accurate recognition that behind the politics of the IRA lurks the resentful hatred of the havenots directed at all the haves Irish or English Protestant or Catholic in a poor country Yet there is an extra portion of resentment for the successes of their own kind They hated you The IRA was only saying what had always been whispered in kitchens and sculleries    Working for their own kind stuck in their gullets Expected to wear livery Well they wouldnt No What was the new moneyed class but gombeen men opportunists the scum that rises to the surface Though its great fun to read the latest nostalgic countryhouse novel of eccentric EnglishIrish life by a Molly Keane or the latest takeoff on such fiction by a J P Donleavy its also worth considering that Julia OFaolain in her bitter comprehensive realism has produced a book that has few if any parallels in contemporary Irish fiction and that must be read by all who care about that country as it really is HOME RULE ROME RULE When Julia OFaolain talks about the Irish national question she sounds more dogmatic than she likes and she apologizes But in a recent telephone interview from her home in Los Angeles it was clear that she is as consumed with the issue of possible unification as are her characters and her Dublin in No Country for Young Men published in Britain in 1980 Unification soaks every issue that comes up in Ireland Ms OFaolain said The divorce referendum last year for example was immediately connected with the northern problem The feeling is that you give the Protestants a handle letting them ask Why does the South stay in this medieval condition They see the southern Irish obeying the Pope refusing modern freedoms like abortion and birth control and they say well look there is no freedom in that state  home rule is Rome rule Indeed we have this ongoing relation with Rome she acknowledged We are one of the most obedient countries Talk of Irish obedience led Ms OFaolain pronounced oFWEHlawn to somewhat caustic remarks about Pope John Paul II The rigor with which he promotes orthodoxy in the Roman Catholic Church she said does complicate the Irish situation Her novel in progress is about Pope Pius IX who decreed papal infallibility Ms OFaolain who is 54 was raised in Dublin and often visits there Can the national question be resolved I suppose the Catholics will outbreed the Protestants and will win by the ballot and be able to give up the bullet Of course thats what the Protestants are afraid of
KOCH SEES CATHOLIC FOSTER-CARE CURB,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/03/nyregion/koch-sees-catholic-foster-care-curb.html,Mayor Koch said yesterday that he now expected the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York to discontinue the foster care it provides to more than 2000 city children I know of no way out the Mayor said in his strongest language on the subject so far Coming close to ruling out the chances for a compromise on a recent court agreement that the archdiocese opposes the Mayor added Regrettably I cannot change the law City and archdiocesan officials have been talking for months trying to find a way for the archdiocese to accept a recent court stipulation that states that foster children must have meaningful access to familyplanning information services and counseling  including abortion and birth control Comments by Cardinal The archdiocese registered its objections shortly after the stipulation settling a 13yearold lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union was issued in October The matter has been under negotiation since then but gained prominence in the last two weeks because John Cardinal OConnor spoke out on it publicly In a Washington speech 10 days ago and again last week the Cardinal denounced the court agreement which takes into account existing laws and legal decisions on abortion and birth control How many realize the extent of this ACLU victory the Cardinal wrote in the Jan 29 issue of Catholic New York the archdiocesan weekly newspaper Will it end with the city of New York In my judgment it will sweep the United States Will it end with driving the church out of child care only Whos kidding whom If the childcare agencies affiliated with the archdiocese do not renew some of the city contracts that expire June 30 about 2400 foster children in group care would be affected The city would have to find other agencies to take over the contracts the Mayor said yesterday at a City Hall news conference A Different Position The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn has taken a position at odds with Cardinal OConnors A spokesman for the diocese Frank De Rosa said fostercare agencies affiliated with the diocese would be allowed to make their own decisions about whether to renew the contracts they have with the city The nine Brooklyn agencies care for about 5000 foster children but only 550 of them are in group homes The New York Archdiocese is concerned about the stipulations impact on group care and has not indicated plans to stop placing children in individual foster homes Mr De Rosa said officials of the agencies and the Brooklyn Diocese would meet in April to discuss the matter It Is a Tragedy Koch administration officials are still trying to find a way to retain the foster services of the New York Archdiocese But the Mayor supportive of the Cardinal and critical of the stipulation that city lawyers helped draft made clear yesterday that he was not hopeful It is a tragedy that the archdiocese understandably because of religious reasons cannot continue to provide foster care Mr Koch said The archdiocese takes the position that this is unacceptable to them and I understand it I absolutely understand it Marcia Robinson Lowry of the Civil Liberties Union took issue yesterday with Cardinal OConnor Hes still trying to take the moral high ground about imposing Catholic teachings on these children but more than half of these kids in these archdiocesan agencies are not Catholic she said Im sort of surprised nobodys focused on that One would think they would be less sympathetic when they realized that theyre not even Catholic kids
U.S. IS CONSIDERING MUCH WIDER TESTS FOR AIDS INFECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/04/us/us-is-considering-much-wider-tests-for-aids-infection.html,Federal health officials said today that they were considering recommending much wider blood testing for infection by the AIDS virus including tests for all applicants for marriage licenses and for everyone who is hospitalized or who is treated for pregnancy or for sexually transmitted diseases The test is now required only of blood donors military recruits and among people in the military The proposal is prompted by the continuing spread of AIDS and the threat it poses to unborn children according to Dr Walter Dowdle AIDS director for the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta Officials are considering such dramatic new measures because they fear that education alone will not halt the spread of the AIDS virus by unknowing carriers 30000 Victims in America AIDS has already struck at least 30000 Americans more than half of whom have died It is projected to cause more than 50000 deaths a year in the United States alone by 1991 Dr Dowdle emphasized that the officials were considering the proposal as a way of stimulating wide debate on measures public health officials might take to control the lethal disease It is expected to be put forward at a public forum the Centers will hold Feb 24 and 25 in Atlanta The proposal has already generated controversy from those who believe it could violate personal rights and frighten potentially infected people away from medical facilities and it is expected to bring clashes over attempts to protect civil liberties as opposed to protecting public health The Time Is Ripe Dr Dowdle said The time is ripe to discuss these ideas in an open forum and to make certain we do not overlook any possible way to curb the epidemic The Centers for Disease Control would submit any recommendations made at the February meeting to the State and Territorial Health Officers for their consideration Dr Dowdle said This is a consensus building and multistep process Dr Dowdle said It is not our intention to have a Federal statute Acquired immune deficiency syndrome an incurable disease cripples the bodys immune system leaving the victim susceptible to infections and cancers It is caused by a virus that spreads through sexual intercourse or exchanges of blood as in shared hypodermic needles In the United States most of the victims of the disease have been homosexual men or intravenous drug users and their sexual partners Four percent of the cases have been attributed to viruses spread through heterosexual intercourse In the past the Federal Government has encouraged AIDS tests for people considered at high risk such as male homosexuals and intravenous drug users More systematic widespread screening would be a major change that would pose an extraordinary challenges to doctors hospital workers and health officials working to protect confidentiality of those infected with the virus Dr Dowdle and others said Some people infected with the virus have lost jobs and health insurance even if they show no signs of illness The test detects antibodies to the AIDS virus Antibodies are substances the body produces to defend against invading mircoorganisms People can be infected with the AIDS virus and not become ill for many years though healthy in this period the carriers are presumed able to transmit the virus to others Jeffrey Levi political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington said the proposal to create debate on AIDS testing had laudable public health objectives But he added that the proposal in ignoring the social consequences undermines its public health value Only as Good as Counseling Blood testing for the AIDS virus is only as good as counseling the infected people receive he said But Mr Levi said that if the Government combined testing with a major counseling program a general education program antidiscrimination protections and dealing with the health insurance issue then I think we could begin to talk While not addressing himself specifically to Mr Levis comments Dr Dowdle said such reactions reflected why the Government had invited about 250 public health officials and representatives of civil liberties groups who may oppose the proposal to the meeting at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Atltanta Following the meeting the Centers for Disease Control will decide whether to make a formal recommendation about expanded testing for AIDS Such a recommendation would not be binding on the states hospitals or government agencies Dr Dowdle said Children would be the intended beneficiary of premarital and prenatal testing to detect the AIDS virus Dr Dowdle said There is a 30 percent to 50 percent chance of a mother who tests positive for the AIDS virus passing the infection on to the child and most children who test positive for AIDS at birth have some manifestation of the disease within a few years Dr Dowdle said It would be up to prospective parents to decide whether to bear children and if a pregnant woman was infected with the AIDS virus to have an abortion The CDC is not proposing that people who show signs of infection be denied marriage licenses Dr Dowdle said Testing for AIDS when people are admitted to a hospital would provide the physician with information that may directly relate to the way he cares for the patient Dr Dowdle said Some of the proposed measures such as premarital blood testing for AIDS would require action by state legislatures State laws vary widely New York for example no longer requires a premarital blood test

POLICE ACADEMY '87: ADAPTING TO A CHANGED NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/06/nyregion/police-academy-87-adapting-to-a-changed-new-york.html,Atteeention the drill sergeant yelled at 200 men and women One man slouched Another saluted with his left hand Abooout face A few turned the wrong way A few more stumbled The sergeant was not amused This is unbelievable the sergeant Albert Gotay bellowed at a new crop of police recruits on their first day of gym class at the Police Academy Look straight ahead when youre at attention Do things in unison Youre not civilians anymore he told them Youre in a semimilitary outfit People have got to look up to you Soon they would look better But this was Zero Day the last day of a week of orientation lessons at the Academy and the 200 recruits  part of a larger class of more than 1000  were struggling Less Military Experience Twenty years ago when Sergeant Gotay first began teaching at the Academy where all recruits are trained before they become full officers such lessons were not so necessary Most recruits entering the department came with military experience and were used to regimen and order But the faces staring back at the sergeant last week were entirely different Few had military experience Many still lived at home There were more women more members of minority groups more recruits with college educations even masters degrees These experts say are the faces of a whole new Police Department The city these recruits will serve has changed too So have social mores and the expectations  and the scrutiny  of the public The Police Academy in turn has been adjusting to these changes How the Academy has done so and how well will unfold over the next five months as the newest class of recruits is trained The recruits still are drawn primarily from workingclass communities often from Nassau and Suffolk Counties But the diversity in their backgrounds experts say while still not sufficient  adds a broader more representative perspective and a potential to better understand and serve the melting pot that is New York Yet the differences among the recruits many older officers say has also forced the department to struggle to regain the sense of cohesiveness that came naturally when the force was made up almost exclusively of men of Irish and Italian heritage Some academy traditions had to change A physical agility test that used to be an entrance requirement for the Academy was moved under pressure to the end to allow women to learn the skills and pass There are also lectures now about dating On the third day of orientation sessions the women recruits were summoned out of an auditorium into a hallway You are not to fraternize with the instructors Sgt Alicia Parker of the integritydiscipline unit told them Dont go around flirting and batting your eyes Nor she said were they to wear heavy rouge false eyelashes or bright fingernail polish Two days earlier the commanding officer of the recruit training school Deputy Inspector Henry A Harrison ordered the physicaleducation instructors to keep their hands off the recruits In the last class he warned two instructors were transferred from the Academy for dating recruits The dating game among recruits however which is acceptable to the Police Department began from Day One A group of male recruits sitting along a wall in the auditorium on the first day eyed two women strolling by Shes cute a tall husky male told his new friends gesturing to one of the women I wouldnt mind being her partner He might at least get to be in her company While at the Academy the recruits will be assigned to smaller groups of 30 to 40 called companies to learn about everything from how to stop a car to search and seizure laws from the use  and misuse  of force to cardiopulmonary resuscitation In the past recruits at the Academy on East 20th Street were divided almost at random When the commanding officer of recruit administration Lieut Jonathan P Orlove was a recruit in 1968 all the recruits from Long Island and Queens who were over six feet tall were put in one group But these days Lieutenant Orlove and other officials distribute the recruits  their names and backgrounds on index cards  by race by sex and for the first time by geography The distribution is part of a larger effort officials say to broaden the recruits understanding of different cultures Breaking Up Clusters Geography was added to the list this year officials say because Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward wanted to prevent clusters of friendships that he says breed a tolerance for corruption His concern came in the wake of the scandal in the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn in which 12 officers were indicted on charges ranging from stealing garbage cans to stealing and selling guns and drugs Watching recruits arrive during their first two weeks academy officials said they were encouraged by the diversity In the current class which started with 1091 recruits there are 666 white men 83 black men 143 Hispanic men and 4 AsianAmerican men There are 95 white women 48 black women and 42 Hispanic women More than 10 percent have an associate degree and about the same have bachelors or advanced college degrees according to the head of the Academy Deputy Chief John J Hill Still some things have not changed Fear is one of them On the first day with snow falling heavily John Cavalcante was so afraid of being late that he left his house in West Islip LI at 430 AM  when he was not due until 737 AM I sat in my car in the parking lot he said sheepishly and waited Constant Warnings In the hallways bathrooms and pizza parlors that recruits poured into on breaks they worried about keeping up with heavy course work in social science police science and law surviving the militarylike discipline and avoiding penalties called Star Cards They heard constant warnings about everything from being late to failing tests dressing sloppily to using drugs If you are caught using drugs we are going to fire you Lieut Gerard Frielingsdorf told the recruits on their first day of orientation Its as simple as that We do not teach integrity said another instructor Sgt Philip Lens of the integritydiscipline unit If in fact you do not have it we will get rid of you Of the initial class of 1091 recruits 20 already have resigned Another woman one month pregnant was told to leave on the first day even though she planned to have an abortion Later more recruits will drop out fail out or be ordered out Forfeiting Personal Styles Those who stay must forfeit their personal styles for that of the department At a Bronx hair salon Peter Akey 20 years old watched ruefully in the mirror as the barber snipped more and more of his sandy hair away He was sorry he said to see his locks go But go they must The Police Departments recruits do as they are told By the eighth day all the recruits appeared in the uniform they will wear until they graduate a light blue shirt dark blue trousers blue tie and shiny lacedup shoes This years outfit also includes a dark blue cap and a jacket which has not yet arrived because of delays in contract bidding caused by the scandal in the citys Parking Violations Bureau The cap was added Inspector Harrison said to give recruits more practice looking and acting like police officers In the past he said they saluted too much too little or with their heads uncovered Learning How to Salute One time he added the Commissioner was driving by the Ninth Precinct station house in lower Manhattan and a recent graduate her jacket unbuttoned waved at him He stopped the car and looked Inspector Harrison said But she just stood there smiling and waving smiling and waving We want them to learn how to salute The instructors also want the recruits to learn how to defend lives and if necessary to take them Guns were selected on Zero Day but unlike the 1960s when some classes waited only a week before carrying them these recruits will not get them until graduation One recruit Susan Montalvo 22 was told to choose a Ruger a Smith  Wesson round butt or a Smith  Wesson square butt Like many at the Academy she would just as soon not have bothered My hands are all sweaty because Im nervous she told the instructor Officer Alfred Medina who was trying to explain the difference between the three twopound guns I dont like guns she said I havent touched one since I was 8 That will change over the next 22 weeks along with everything else Already before their first homework assignment before their first situp and before their first aim for a bullseye there is talk of final exams of graduation and of first precinct assignments John Graffeo a 30yearold recruit who lives in Ozone Park Queens plans to keep his eyes on the prize a blue badge Its not going to be a breeze by any means he said leaning against a wall on a break during the second day of orientation But if you have the right attitude youll make it through Im looking far away he said I just want to graduate come July Next The recruits  a class portrait
WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Conservatives Astir,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/07/us/washington-talk-briefing-conservatives-astir.html,Concerned that the future of conservatism in America is bleak despite Ronald Reagan some leading architects of the New Right are courting a new image and promoting a philosophy they call cultural conservatism Its chief exponent is Paul Weyrich a central figure in the New Right who is a prime mover in the creation of some of its basic institutions including the Heritage Foundation the House Republican Study Committee and the Senate Republican Steering Committee What concerns Mr Weyrich and a growing number of conservatives of like mind is a fear that the Reagan revolution is more revivalmeeting enthusiasm based on the personality of Mr Reagan than it is a real shift toward conservatism among the American electorate And a colleague of Mr Weyrich says that in fact many Americans may perceive the New Right as a synonym for a bunch of nuts Mr Weyrich and the colleague William S Lind have been sounding the alarm to conservatives through Essays on Our Times a series of essays published by another of the organizations that Mr Weyrich founded the Institute for Government and Politics In one of the essays Mr Lind the series editor who is among other things an adviser to the Democratic Presidential aspirant Gary Hart says that it is no secret among conservatives that since the 1980 election the conservative movement has lost its steam In fact Mr Lind suggests perhaps the most serious problem is the negative image of the New Right which he writes has become a term of opprobrium a synonym for a bunch of nuts What Mr Lind and Mr Weyrich suggest is dropping the term New Right altogether and replacing it with cultural conservatism In essence that means selling conservative philosophy  conservatism based on upholding traditional morals and values  rather than conservative candidates or conservative legislative efforts like restoring officially sanctioned school prayer or banning abortion
MAYORAL PANEL CITES YOUTH PREGNANCIES IN POOR COMMUNITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/nyregion/mayoral-panel-cites-youth-pregnancies-in-poor-communities.html,Teenagers living in poor neighborhoods give birth in significantly higher numbers than those in the rest of New York City in some cases accounting for more than onequarter of all births in a neighborhood a mayoral panel has found In detailing the incidence of pregnancies among teenagers especially younger ones the report found that the citys black and Hispanic teenagers in all age groups show higher rates of pregnancy than whites and that white teenagers are the most likely to get abortions School officials cite pregnancy as one of the main reasons why female students drop out of school The report said the health districts covering the Mott Haven and Morrisania sections in the South Bronx both designated poverty areas had the most teenage births as a percentage of total births in 1984 the most recent year for which complete statistics were available In Mott Haven teenage girls were responsible for 273 percent of the births in the area in Morrisania they accounted for 259 percent The next highest was the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn with 22 percent followed by 206 percent in Brownsville The lowest percentage was in Flushing Queens with 32 percent To reduce pregnancies among teenagers the panel which included representatives of several city agencies recommended a greater effort by the Board of Education in carrying out its sex education curriculum The board has said that the curriculum is to be compulsory in all schools by next September but has left some leeway at the elementary and intermediate school level as to which parts of the curriculum are to be taught Despite the mandating of the sex education curriculum the report said the school system lacked the trained staff to teach the course At least 5000 trained teachers are needed for fullfillment of the course the report estimated but only 1600 teachers had been trained by the start of the school year last September
NEWEST JUDICIAL ACTIVISTS COME FROM THE RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/weekinreview/newest-judicial-activists-come-from-the-right.html,AS the prominence of conservative legal thinkers has grown during the Reagan Administration so has a split about the fundamental issues of constitutional jurisprudence The division centers on whether judges should take the activist role of striking down a wide range of economic regulations For decades conservatives have assailed liberal judicial activists complaining that they use expansive interpretations of constitutional rights to usurp the powers of elected representatives The immediate issues have been such matters as abortion school prayer and pornography but the conservative call for judicial restraint extended to the economic realm as well Greater judicial deference to the political branches was a dominant theme at a convention here last weekend of a group called the Federalist Society which was attended by Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and several of President Reagans judicial appointees But some conservatives have begun to argue for judicial activism of a different kind Prof Richard A Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School for example wants courts to use the Constitutions protection of property and contract rights to strike down rent control and zoning laws the minimum wage the Social Security system and much of the modern Federal regulatory apparatus He also questions the constitutionality of progressive taxation He wants the Supreme Court to return to the approach of decisions like Lochner v New York in 1905 which struck down a law limiting bakery employees hours to 10 a day and 60 a week The Court saying workers might want to work longer hours to earn more money held that the law unconstitutionally interfered with the right of contract between the employer and employees Lochner and similar decisions in the years before President Franklin D Roosevelt reshaped the Court have been repudiated by the Court and by most scholars conservative and liberal alike as unwarranted judicial legislation But Mr Epstein maintains that even those decisions based on a generous reading of the liberty protected by due process of law did not go far enough Prof Bernard H Siegan of the University of San Diego Law School another advocate of reviving the preNew Deal approach to property and contract rights was nominated by President Reagan last week to be a Federal appellate judge Mr Epstein Mr Siegan and other freemarket libertarians as they are sometimes called are far less known and less numerous than the traditional conservative advocates of judicial restraint such as Justice Scalia who tend to construe governmental powers broadly and individual rights narrowly Mr Epstein cheerfully volunteered in an interview that he was way off the scale of modern constitutional doctrine But the freemarket libertarians have a following among young conservatives whose longing to see much of the modern regulatory state swept away counterbalances qualms about whether this is a job for judges Mr Epstein said his ideas were gaining ground and contributing to a breakdown in the traditional dichotomy between left and right liberal and conservative While Mr Epstein seems a conservative in his advocacy of the free market and his abhorrence of governmental regulation his view that judges should aggressively enforce their interpretations of vague constitutional language is akin to the approach of liberals such as Justice William J Brennan Jr of the Supreme Court Conservatives such as Justice Scalia and Judge Robert H Bork of the Federal appeals court here who has long urged deference to democratic choice have taken issue with those promoting judicial protection of economic rights Mr Bork has written that Mr Siegans approach while well reasoned would revolutionize the government of the United States making judges supreme legislators And Gary L McDowell associate director of public affairs at the Justice Department wrote last year that the unholy coupling that is occurring betwen the liberal left and the libertarian right was a pernicious movement in constitutional theory Meanwhile libertarian conservatives such as Edward H Crane president of the Cato Institute have even suggested that Justice Scalia and Chief Justice William H Rehnquist whose appointments last summer delighted most conservatives may be wrong for the job Mr Crane wrote recently that the brand of judicial restraint or majoritarianism deferring to elected officials departs from the individualist free market tradition that is the best of conservative thought But Mr Scalia warned in a 1984 paper that constitutionalizing economic rights might reinforce the liberal brand of judicial activism I have little hope he said that judicial and lawyerly attitudes can be coaxed back to a more restricted view of the courts role in a democratic society at the same time that we are charging ahead on an entirely new front
SUCKERS FOR ELECTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/books/suckers-for-elections.html,THE CAPTIVE PUBLIC How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power By Benjamin Ginsberg 272 pp New York Basic Books 1895 IN our democracy we are often told the people will be heard While in other countries the elites of left or right exalt themselves in spite of what anyone else may think our Government pays close attention to mass sentiment In the United States there is a gigantic mechanism set up just to allow us to vent our political opinions we vote on a regular basis and we are also diligently polled by mail and telephone and in chance encounters Such procedures would appear to be the overwhelming proof that we the people speak and are therefore in charge Yet our routine performance at the polls or for the pollsters may be an indication not of public might but of public weakness In his troubling book The Captive Public Benjamin Ginsberg explores a problem first noticed by Tocqueville  in a democracy the people see themselves as the masters of a responsive government whereas it is the government that grows more masterful the more responsive it becomes As the scope of governmental power increases    what citizens initially believed to be reins    become the ends of their own chains Mr Ginsberg writes In a democracy in other words the people will be herded Mr Ginsberg traces this problem from its origins in the 18th century arguing that Western regimes first became attentive to mass opinion only out of weakness Faced with a reflexively hostile populace the state proceeded to soften up its wary subjects by according them the rights of modern citizenship The extension of the vote for instance made it easier for a government to raise troops and collect taxes and also helped it to become the high object of inchoate patriotic feelings More important the spread of electoral politics although commonly conceived as an egalitarian development in fact offered an orderly way to tame the publics threatening impulses  to vote meant not to strike or riot In short the early modern state faced with the necessity of accommodating mass opinion turned that obligation into a grand advantage the state did not passively observe its subjects attitudes but worked to alter and contain them in order to empower itself The Captive Public is an acute study of the current political consequences of that protracted effort by the state The book is at its best in its analyses of how elections and opinion polls tend to create the very consensus they seem simply to reveal To most Americans voting seems a practice somehow more legitimate than lawsuits direct action organizing parliamentary procedure lobbying or other possible modes of participation This overemphasis on the ballot Mr Ginsberg points out derives from the curriculum in every elementary and secondary school where the voting process is exalted not only in regular civics lessons but also more subtly through the annual example of class elections Such instruction reconfirmed day after day one might add by our politicians columnists and television anchors promotes the tenacious myth of mass control and governmental pliancy This myth Mr Ginsberg shows statistically seems also to be reinforced by the very act of voting In the 1968 and 1972 Presidential elections many voters who believed that officials did not care expressed after voting a more favorable view of governments responsiveness  whether they voted Democratic or for Richard M Nixon the winner The Captive Public offers a clear challenge to the persistent fantasy of electoral sway Regular elections Mr Ginsberg allows do tend to make the publics influence independent of the states might whereas the threat of riot will succeed or fail according to a rulers strength or weakness the electoral sanction need not be affected by the rulers forces so that popular influence and rulers power could potentially coexist At the same time however elections suppress the populace by means more indirect than martial law Because they take place only at certain intervals elections necessarily limit the frequency of citizen participation in politics Moreover they permit citizens to take part only in the selection of leaders not in the formation of policy or in the composition of cabinets or agencies Also electoral laws  registration requirements and districting  work to reinforce the status quo Finally elections dilute the activism of the zealous few by reducing all participants to mere voters If balloting had occurred in 1776    the American colonies would no doubt have remained part of the British Empire Mr Ginsberg suggests Mr Ginsberg elaborates cogently on each of these grim perceptions With the same thoroughness he questions the large effects of the opinion poll which he sees correctly not as a mere recording device but as a subtle instrument of power Polling has rendered public opinion less dangerous less disruptive more permissive and perhaps more amenable to governmental control he says The analysis is especially important Mr Ginsberg makes several other sharp and timely observations that illuminate the current drift of American politics  a drift unmistakably away from direct popular influence What we have now in part because of the developments he covers is a system insecurely based not on mass opinion but only on the management of mass opinion We took Reykjavik and turned what was really a sour situation into something that turned out pretty well Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff boasted recently to reporters Such a blithe admission of deceit makes clear that ours is a system of government by public relations Although invaluable as a careful study of the mass opinion apparatus The Captive Public is perhaps a bit too careful to do justice to the complex advertising mechanism that has swallowed up our politics Mr Ginsbergs focus is too narrow his key terms often crude For instance the state as he uses the term over and over refers exclusively to governmental agencies of regulation The book ends darkly with a long catalogue of Federal intrusions into daily life equating such enfeebled bodies as the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Food and Drug Administration with the omnipresent shadow of Big Brother Although it would be a mistake to insist that it cant happen here this quasiOrwellian vision is oversimple The authors libertarian bias has led him largely to ignore the subtle and extensive interrelationships between government the larger corporations and their advertising agencies and the mass media especially television It is this grand convergence of commercial and political forces that makes up the state today and it has everything to do with what Mr Ginsberg calls the domestication of mass belief Swaying the public has been the main preoccupation of big business in this century and yet Mr Ginsberg mentions marketing or advertising only now and then At a time when the President is routinely pitched on television like a can of cola and when New Yorks biggest advertising agencies are buying up Washingtons biggest publicrelations and lobbying concerns this doctrinaire view of state power is inadequate AS its title implies The Captive Public offers little hope that the people may ever win real control of their government Again such pessimism may be wellfounded but Mr Ginsbergs despair seems to have been induced by not just actual events but also the requirements of his own thesis He writes that western governments have created a marketplace of ideas whose purpose is to regulate popular perspectives and sentiments Within the marketplace ideas must be vigorously promoted to become widely known and accepted Indeed virtually all widespread political concerns Mr Ginsberg claims have been deliberately created by skilled lobbyists and propagandists representing groups that stand to benefit materially or politically from the principles in question As evidence Mr Ginsberg presents two examples the nuclear freeze was conceived by liberal activists as a way to keep millions of Yuppies from supporting President Reagan and the wellorganized righttolife campaign was simply a move by conservative politicians to forge a winning alliance between Catholics and Protestant evangelicals Here Mr Ginsberg goes too far Certainly it is true that the public consciousness has been pervaded by the mass media and true also that todays collective passions are often sparked or spread by publicrelations experts This book however implies that a political idea need only be advertised relentlessly in order to set millions marching  as if anything sold properly can be put over on the captive public In fact it is not just any idea that will move at first activists then multitudes but only that idea whose time has come Even if the campaigns against abortion and the arms race were instigated only to build mammoth voting blocs and such a claim is arguable that alone cannot explain the intense appeal of both movements today An explanation of that appeal would begin with some awareness of psychology  and a willingness to see the public as living people trying to contend with threatening forces For the sake of a smooth argument Mr Ginsberg has translated his fellow citizens

REAGAN SAID TO BACK MEASURE TO BAR ANY FEDERAL AID FOR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/10/us/reagan-said-to-back-measure-to-bar-any-federal-aid-for-abortion.html,President Reagan has endorsed a new legislative proposal for a permanent ban on all Federal assistance for abortions according to Congressional and Administration sources The draft legislation which the President approved late last month would also bar any group from receiving Federal funds if it performed abortions or counseled clients about such services A third provision which would have no legal effect would declare that the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion was wrongly decided A Push Before Term Ends The proposal represents a lastditch attempt by the Administration to enact its antiabortion stance into law in its final two years Opponents of abortion have criticized the Administration for not pursuing their cause more vigorously For six years the Administration has been almost entirely unsuccessful in carrying out its agenda on conservative social issues As one White House official acknowledged this legislation faces very tough opposition on Capitol Hill and is unlikely to become law Its just an outrageous assault on womens rights and the Constitution argued Representative Don Edwards the California Democrat who heads the Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights Its going to be resisted with great determination The committee would be one of several expected to have jurisdiction over the legislation Representative Henry J Hyde an Illinois Republican who is a leading opponent of abortion agreed that the bills prospects for passage were poor But you cant just sit around and count noses and say its not worth trying said Mr Hyde You have to keep trying and you never know Democrats in the House are likely to try to keep the legislation bottled up in committee Supporters would probably attempt to use parliamentary maneuvers to force action on the House floor but at this point they are not very hopeful of their success A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr Reagan is committed to sending up legislation The President believes in this as an important moral issue the official added There are two years left in his term and its one of the issues hes always spoken out about On a related issue Mr Reagan urged conservatives gathered at the White House today to help win passage of legislation that would give states and localities more freedom to experiment with new kinds of welfare programs Mr Reaganhe has made this measure a top domestic priority for his remaining years in office The President maintained that a new bipartisan consensus had emerged on the issue There is common ground Mr Reagan said We all know it isnt working We know there will be no easy answers Mr Reagan also used his appearance to emphasize that he was doing fine after prostate surgery last month Ill be off my limited schedule fairly soon said the President The antiabortion measure represents a compromise for many who would prefer a Constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court decision of 1973 Roe v Wade Congress has repeatedly shown it is unwilling to back such an amendment For the last 10 years Congress has annually passed amendments that ban the use of Federal funds to finance abortions through the Medicaid program That ban has been gradually expanded to include such programs as federally subsidized health insurance for military personnel and medical services on Indian reservations and in Federal prisons Representative Hyde who has sponsored the annual amendments barring the use of Federal funds said the new proposal was an attempt to maximize the advantage of having a prolife President before he leaves office Lobbying groups that support a womans right to choose an abortion say they have won the legislative battle Their big fear now they say is that one of the older justices who voted for the Roe decision such as Associate Justice William J Brennan who is 80 years old might not survive until the end of the Reagan Presidency Under the second provision of the bill the Planned Parenthood Federation of America among other groups would lose the funds it receives under Federal family planning programs about 30 million a year The federation which runs about 700 clinics says none of the money goes for abortion services Last month Jo Ann Gasper the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for population affairs issued a memorandum threatening to cut off Planned Parenthood funds by administrative action Ms Gasper was immediately reprimanded by Robert E Windom the Assistant Secretary for Health who said she had exceeded her authority The third clause of the legislation would declare that in the view of Congress an unborn child is a human being and that the right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution A White House official said the statement was included because conservatives feel it is important from a moral leadership point of view even though it would not have the force of law
REAGAN EXPECTED TO BACK PROPOSAL ON MAJOR ILLNESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/10/us/reagan-expected-to-back-proposal-on-major-illness.html,President Reagan is expected to support a health insurance program for catastrophic illness that would expand Medicare coverage of elderly people Administration officials said today The decision would end more than two months of debate that produced an impasse within the Administration The program for catastrophic illness would be similar to one proposed in November by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr Otis R Bowen the officials said Under the Bowen plan an elderly person would pay 492 a month in Medicare premiums on top of the 1790 a month now charged In return Medicare would cover an unlimited number of days of hospital care and the beneficiarys outofpocket payments for Medicarecovered services would be limited to 2000 a year Currently there is no such limit Signal of Reagan Decision Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health signaled the Presidents decision in a memorandum to other Republicans in Congress after a White House meeting last week The Administration has agreed to support a plan very similar to the original Bowen plan he wrote He said the White House would submit a detailed legislative proposal later this month White House officials said Mr Reagan had not made a final decision on the options submitted to him over the weekend but they predicted that Mr Gradisons account would soon be proved correct Foes of Bowen Plan Mobilize On another issue involving healthcare funds Mr Reagan has endorsed a proposal that would permanently ban Federal assistance for abortions Congressional and Administration sources said [ Page A20 ] With a Presidential decision imminent on insurance for catastrophic illness opponents of the Bowen plan are mobilizing one last effort to persuade the President to reject it Conservatives in and out of the Government have argued strenuously against the Bowen plan contending that the Medicare program should not be expanded at the expense of the health insurance industry But Administration officials said they expected Mr Reagan to support a proposal like the Bowen plan for several reasons He has been told by Republican members of Congress that it would be futile for him to oppose it he does not want a battle over the issue with Congress and within the Administration opponents of the Bowen plan have not come up with a comprehensive alternative Beryl W Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers has been a leading critic of the Bowen plan saying it would increase Federal spending and replace a competitive private insurance market with a Government monopoly But late last week he withdrew his proposal to give people vouchers or coupons with which they could buy private insurance for catastrophic illness Administration officials said Voucher Plans Prospects Congressional hearings last month made clear that the voucher proposal would not be taken seriously on Capitol Hill the officials said At the hearings Democrats and moderate Republicans praised Dr Bowen and his plan Their only criticism was that he had not gone far enough in proposing Government programs to help people pay the high costs of long or severe illnesses Dr Bowen says most of the 31 million Medicare beneficiaries would sign up for the additional coverage offered under his plan If 30 million people paid the 59 annual premium the Government could collect nearly 18 billion a year Government actuaries believe that would be enough to cover the cost of new benefits Republican legislators said Mr Reagan would be in a weak bargaining position if he proposed a health insurance plan that relied entirely on private industry The Democrats who control both houses of Congress have already decided that there should be some expansion of Medicare Mr Reagan put catastrophic insurance in the forefront of domestic policy concerns but liberals and conservatives both say he appears to have lost political control of the issue Without waiting for his recommendations Congress has begun work on legislation Mr Reagan stimulated interest in health insurance for catastrophic illness when he directed Dr Bowen to study the issue in his State of the Union Message last February He said he wanted to know how the private sector and Government can work together to address the problem White House officials said Mr Reagan might still make some changes in the Bowen plan They said he would emphasize the need for the health insurance industry and employers to be involved in any solution he finally proposed For example they said there will be a role for the insurance industry in providing insurance for the costs of nursing home care and a role for private employers who will be encouraged to cover the costs of catastrophic illness for employees The Administration does not have detailed estimates of the cost of Dr Bowens plan The Secretary and his chief of staff Thomas R Burke said their plan would not add to the Federal budget deficit because premiums would fully cover the cost of the added benefits However critics including the Office of Management of Budget said Congress would for political reasons be reluctant to increase the premium to cover the rising costs of the program in future years In addition to Mr Sprinkel critics of the Bowen plan include James C Miller 3d director of the budget office Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Charles D Hobbs assistant to the President for policy development In the memorandum submitted to Mr Reagan over the weekend White House officials said there was only one major alternative to the Bowen plan a proposal drafted by Mr Hobbs that would rely mainly on private industry without any expansion of Medicare Under this plan the Government would set stricter standards for benefits that must be provided by any private insurance policy advertised as a supplement to Medicare But aides to Republican lawmakers said leaders of their party in the House were urging Mr Reagan to support the Bowen plan Republican Representatives such as Robert H Michel of Illinois the minority leader and Marge Roukema of New Jersey have spoken favorably of the Bowen plan Under Dr Bowens plan the premium would be automatically increased each year to cover the expected costs of providing care for catastrophic illnesses But the Government would not pay for goods and services such as prescription drugs dental care and eye examinations that are not now covered by Medicare Mr Gradison and Representative Fortney H Stark a California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health said they had reached agreement on the outlines of legislation to expand Medicare to protect the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illness

ROBERTSON TESTS THE CANDIDATE VOICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/us/robertson-tests-the-candidate-voice.html,The Rev Pat Robertson spoke on drugs and sex at a Christian parochial school but he did not mention his support of voluntary school prayer until a student raised the question He visited a crisis pregnancy center operated by opponents of abortion but did not berate the Supreme Court for legalizing abortion Instead he patted the babies cuddled by volunteers and praised the centers work in promoting the dignity of life At a health care center he answered questions about war and peace and insurance for catastrophic illness from elderly patients many of whom sat in wheelchairs without a hint of his belief in faith healing part of his television ministry over the years And at a gathering of his evangelical followers many of whom shouted Amen to his remarks and addressed him as Brother Pat he was questioned as much about farm problems and nuclear power as about moral revival which he has called for On his first visit to New Hampshire since November Mr Robertson was sounding more like a Republican Presidential hopeful in search of political credibility than like a Christian broadcaster on a moral crusade But his two days of campaigning here also underscored the dual and some say conflicting tasks he faces in trying to broaden his political appeal and at the same time mobilize fundamentalist and evangelical Christians behind his candidacy What invigorates his Christian followers is the prospect of an evangelical preacher becoming President and seeking to lead the nation in a moral revival But that same prospect makes it more difficult for Mr Robertson to attract support beyond that base State Senator Mark Hounsell one of the few Robertson supporters among this states Republican regulars complained to reporters that there was too much emphasis on Mr Robertsons background as an evangelist and not enough on what he has been saying A Natural Constituency Mr Hounsell said Mr Robertsons chances in the 1988 New Hampshire primary next February where his support is difficult to measure now could depend largely on his ability to organize the 10000 to 20000 evangelical Christians he estimates form Mr Robertsons natural constituency in this predominantly Roman Catholic state The Rev John Fortin the 33yearold pastor of the Faith Christian Center an interdenominational church in Manchester where Sunday services attract nearly 1000 people said most Robertson supporters understood the political necessity of his broadening his message beyond the social issues they care about Although Mr Robertson at least on this trip sounded not much different on policy questions from any other Republican aspirant Mr Fortin said We know he is a man of prayer who has a strong spiritual base in his life Mr Fortin said he would not endorse a Robertson candidacy from the pulpit but would join other Protestant clergymen in trying to mobilize active evangelical people outside the church Mr Robertson a 56yearold Southern Baptist preacher acknowledged in an interview that the first major threshold he had to cross in his quest for political legitimacy was to be seen as a candidate rather than a television preacher Preacher he says is a term that does not do justice to his background as a Yaleeducated lawyer and business excutive who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network a 200millionayear cable televison enterprise in Virginia Beach Va To lower his profile as an evangelist he has given up his role as host of 700 Club a talk and news show carried on his cable television network although he still does occasional news commentaries on the program He also has turned over the daytoday operation of his cable television network to a son and has taken the position of chairman In September Mr Robertson said he would run for President if three million people signed petitions supporting his candidacy with prayers and money So far he estimated that 600000 signatures had been collected and he said that he would have the remaining 24 million by summer My supporters in California told me last week they will give me one million names by May he told campaign volunteers at his headquarters here Ive been told Ronald Reagan won the New Hampshire primary in 1980 with 34000 votes he said glancing at an aide for confirmation Let me tell you theres nothing impossible about this Further Support Required However among 459 Republican primary voters polled nationally from Jan 18 to 21 only 14 percent said they had a favorable view of Mr Robertson while 26 percent said they had an unfavorable view That finding was subject to a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points Discussing his political strategy in an interview Mr Robertson said he expected to win more than 40 of Michigans 77 national convention delegates in 1988 Then he said he hoped to do well in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary before the campaign shifted to the South where a dozen states with large fundamentalist populations have scheduled primaries for March 8 1988 But no matter how well he does in the South he said his candidacy will not be validated until he demonstrates strength in the Middle West and the West Toward that end he has said he will make a major effort in Minnesota Washington Illinois and possibly Ohio after the Southern primaries Mr Robertson said the Iran arms sales issue that has enveloped the Reagan Administration had dramatically altered the Republican contest primarily by undermining Vice President Bushs position and making political integrity a major concern The best politician in 1988 may well be the nonpolitician Mr Robertson said with a smile
"IN IRISH CAMPAIGN, THE MOOD MATCHES THE WEATHER",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/world/in-irish-campaign-the-mood-matches-the-weather.html,This is a Fianna Fail town so the Fine Gael campaign staff was heartened by the lively crowd that turned out for Prime Minister Garret FitzGeralds walkabout But in the throng talk among FitzGerald supporters was as gloomy as the gray weather and the poll figures that show Dr FitzGeralds party 14 percentage points behind that of his colorful opponent Charles J Haughey I am a very committed supporter of Garret FitzGerald and the kind of pluralistic society he is trying to create said Gerald Maher a schoolteacher wearing a Fine Gael button But he predicted that Dr FitzGeralds deep cuts in social welfare spending would lose him thousands of votes Hes a man 10 years ahead of his time on Northern Ireland divorce contraception and its a shame hes not going to get a second chance Mr Maher concluded Such curbside commentary is common now in Ireland where a respected but embattled Prime Minister is struggling to save himself and to keep his supporters from sliding into defeatism Situation Is Grim Dr FitzGeralds advisers insist it is too early to throw in the towel but they acknowledge that the situation is grim A Fine Gael polltaker Jack Jones and other strategists no longer speak of finishing ahead of Mr Haughey But they do see a way to block his drive to win a majority next Tuesday Dr FitzGerald is going after the large undecided vote about 20 percent With those votes Mr Jones said Fine Gael along with a new centrist party called the Progressive Democrats and the smaller Labor Party could take enough seats among them to prevent Mr Haughey and Fianna Fail from winning a majority or 84 of the 166 seats in Parliament Dr FitzGerald might then have a chance to form a coalition At best this is a gloomy situation for a twoterm Prime Minister who remains personally popular Dr FitzGeralds trials during what one adviser called a dour campaign point up the importance of the economic issue A scholarly man sometimes called Garret the Good Dr FitzGerald has worked to modernize a traditionridden society But so far this year his record as a reformer has counted for little Ultimately the vast bulk of our people are more concerned about unemployment and emigration than anything else he said in a speech today Prime Minister Is Vulnerable On these scores Dr FitzGerald a 61yearold economist is vulnerable Unemployment is at 250000 or over 19 percent as against 177000 or around 10 percent when he took office in 1982 Unemployment would be greater but for emigration of 30000 a year which has aroused fears of a brain drain among the besteducated young people To defend himself the Prime Minister has come close to disowning his own record The last four years he said today were the legacy of the lunatic policies left by Mr Haughey who was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1981 and again briefly in 1982 Dr FitzGerald now speaks of his tenure as a painful wringingout period that had to be lived through for a payoff to come within three years if he is reelected Hence his defensivesounding slogan Weve done the groundwork Now lets build up the nation The politically damaging part of that groundwork was a cut in Government spending of 421 million or 5 percent announced last month which caused Labor to withdraw from Dr FitzGeralds coalition Government Fine Gael workers concede that the wealthy Mr Haughey with his handsome profile and jaunty demeanor he is known as The Boss  is the more romantic candidate These days Dr FitzGeralds appearance belies the claim that he is having fun With his long slighly doleful face he has a rumpled somber presence that calls to mind Edmund S Muskie These Days Shoes Match Famously absentminded he once showed up on the campaign trail in mismatched shoes Nowadays his shoes are the same color but his shoelaces have lost their plastic tips and acquired the raveled ends more common to schoolboys than prime ministers Mr Haughey a 61yearold millionaire provides the sartorial flash Dr FitzGerald gets by with what The Times of London called the perfect political pedigree for Ireland His parents were in the Easter Rising of 1916 Through his father a poet and later Foreign Minister Dr FitzGerald knew W B Yeats His mother was from the predominantly Protestant North giving him a feel for the diversity of Irish life In his crusade for what he calls a more open country Dr FitzGerald promoted unsuccessful referendums on abortion and divorce He negotiated the BritishIrish Agreement that he and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed on Nov 15 1985 giving Dublin a larger voice in Northern Ireland Agreement Is Popular The agreement is popular with the Irish voters Dr FitzGerald clearly regards it as his bid for a place in history and Mr Haughey has been battling the notion that his more nationalist party Fianna Fail would sabotage the agreement Dr FitzGeralds hopes to change the trend of the campaign may ride on his 90minute televised debate with Mr Haughey on Thursday night Dr FitzGeralds advisers want him to emphasize the BritishIrish agreement and to challenge Mr Haughey for the details of his vague plan to generate new jobs by stimulating the economic growth rate In four campaigns the two have debated three times Mr Haughey who talks with the ease of a man who gave the Blarney Stone a good long kiss won twice according to FitzGerald aides
BROOKLYN BISHOP LIMITS CHURCH USE BY HOMOSEXUALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/nyregion/brooklyn-bishop-limits-church-use-by-homosexuals.html,The Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn has told his 850 priests that groups that condone homosexual activity will no longer be allowed to use churches hospitals or colleges for meetings or religious services The ban applies to the two boroughs in the diocese Brooklyn and Queens In a letter released yesterday the Bishop Francis J Mugavero asked the priests to withdraw any support which may have in the past been given to Dignity or similar groups Dignity is a nationwide support group for Catholic homosexuals that opposes the churchs ban on homosexual activity Under the bishops order another Catholic group called Courage which advocates celibacy for homosexuals would be permitted to use church facilities In Line With Papal Stance A spokesman for the diocese Frank DeRosa said that members of Dignity would be encouraged to participate in regular parish services open to all Catholics The letter of the Brooklyn bishop is consistent with the stance taken by the Vatican in recent months With the approval of Pope John Paul II a Vatican agency issued a strongly worded letter to all bishops in October warning against support for homosexual groups Last year when the Vatican disciplined Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle among the charges cited were that he allowed Dignity to use the cathedral in his city for a mass In recent months bishops in Atlanta Pensacola Fla Buffalo and Vancouver have told Dignity to stop meeting in its churches according to the organizations national newsletter Groups Express Disappointment In the Archdiocese of New York which is independent of the Brooklyn diocese a special weekly mass is celebrated at St Francis Xavier Church in Greenwich Village for members of Dignity Officials of the New York Archdiocese which includes Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City have said they are reviewing the situation at the church which is run by the Jesuit order Homosexualrights groups yesterday reacted to Bishop Mugaveros order with anger and disappointment It is a very sad thing in the middle of an AIDS crisis to say to gay Catholics that we are going to be less sensitive to your needs than we were in the past said Andrew Humm a spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights I think Bishop Mugavero is basically betraying his own conscience because he knows better Mr DeRosa said the bishops letter in no way diminished the churchs compassion for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome an almost always fatal disease that often strikes homosexual men A person with AIDS who is in a hospital run by the diocese he said would receive the full medical and pastoral services including receiving the sacraments of the church For more than a year Bishop Mugavero has allowed a special mass to be celebrated once a month for members of Dignity at St Augustine Church in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn The pastor of the church the Rev Ernest H Fiorillo said last night that the service would no longer be allowed Senior Citizens Center Used I do not feel good about it Father Fiorillo said adding that the churchs ministry to homosexuals would continue I am personally convinced that we have more gay people at our regular parish mass than in the mass that was held for Dignity He said about 15 people usually attended the Dignity mass The Queens chapter of Dignity meets monthly at a senior citizens center in Woodside The broad nature of the bishops order which takes in churches and other Catholic facilities was apparently designed to include the senior citizen center Bishop Mugavero made it clear in his letter which was sent on Feb 4 that the priests outreach to homosexuals should continue despite the ban on Dignity In his letter to the priests which began Dear Father the Bishop wrote It is my sincere hope that priests in our diocese will continue to provide truly pastoral guidance for homosexual persons and will promote their health and wellbeing in the fullest sense  He was quoting from the Oct 30 letter to the bishops from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith the office charged with preserving orthodoxy of Catholic beliefs Letter Cites Dignity Again quoting from the letter the Bishop wrote All support should be withdrawn from any organizations which seek to undermine the teaching of the church which are ambiguous about it or which neglect it entirely Bishop Mugavero cited Dignity as one such group and directed all pastors priests and administrators of clearly identifiable Catholic organizations to withdraw any support which may have been given in the past to Dignity or any similar groups Furthermore he continued the practice of scheduling religious services or permitting the use of church buildings or the facilities of Catholic schools and colleges or of any other facility identifiable as Catholic is not to be allowed Michael Bushek the editor of the Dignity newsletter said the groups members would not be discouraged We do not need to be inside a church he said The Church is people and not an institution We will meet on the street if we have to We were baptized Catholic and you cannot take that away from us Mugavero Has Liberal Reputation Bishop Mugaveros order surprised homosexual activists and some church officials because the bishop has a reputation of being in the liberal wing of the 300member National Conference of Catholic Bishops In many ways he has served as the counterpoint to John Cardinal OConnor the head of the New York Archdiocese who has been a major proponent of Catholic orthodoxy Unlike the Cardinal Bishop Mugavero has not threatened to pull out of some fostercare programs because of an court order requiring family planning services for children in Catholic facilities But Cardinal OConnor and Bishop Mugavero have joined in speaking out strongly against abortion and in fighting the Gay Rights Bill before the New York City Council last year The bill passed despite the opposition
"WASHINGTON TALK: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT; Miranda Ruling: Complain, Complain, Complain",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/us/washington-talk-justice-department-miranda-ruling-complain-complain-complain.html,Eighteen months ago Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d denounced as infamous and wrong the Supreme Courts ruling in Miranda v Arizona that the police must tell arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel A year ago today he received a 115page report from his Office of Legal Policy arguing that we should seek to have Miranda overruled The report was publicly released last month But so far with the clock running down on the Reagan Administration the Justice Department has not even hinted in its Supreme Court briefs or in any other court that it wants the Court to overrule the 21yearold precedent which Mr Meese contends makes it too hard for the police to get confessions and other information from criminal suspects And department officials suggested today it is not clear that they will make such a request before President Reagan leaves office Why Part of the answer seems to be that some officials even in Mr Meeses Justice Department which has been more bold in criticizing the Supreme Court than any predecessor in the past 50 years are wary of making arguments to the Court that might give offense to its members It also appears that finding an appropriate case in which to urge the Court to overrule Mr Meeses least favorite precedent is a lot harder than finding a forum in which to denounce it Solicitor General Charles Fried who speaks for the Administration in the Supreme Court said in an interview today that I agree with the Attorney Generals views on Miranda and I generally agree with the Office of Legal Policy report but that I am not engaged in scholary reflection about the law I am engaged in a conversation with the Court While stressing that the Court has limited the reach of the Miranda rules in recent years Mr Fried noted that not one member of the Court had suggested that Miranda should be overruled Its my job to carry on the conversation with the Court in a way that is sensitive to what they are saying and what they are interested in Mr Fried said adding that the Attorney General is fully supportive of my judgments regarding the appropriate litigating posture Legal experts including some in the Justice Department doubt that the Courts present majority would look favorably on a direct Administration challenge to Miranda especially one coming in the wake of so many public trumpet blasts by Mr Meese and his aides Some members of the Court look with distaste upon having their precedents kicked around in the political arena by high officials like Mr Meese lawyers who have worked at the Court say A Backlash Atmosphere Andrew L Frey who was the top criminal law expert in the Solicitor Generals office until last year said I dont think its a good idea with the Supreme Court to announce very publicly that youre going to go after some precedent of theirs The press keeps talking about the Meese Justice Department attacking the Court and the Justices read these things and theres a real risk that you create a backlash atmosphere In a Pennsylvania case last year the Court reaffirmed its 1973 decision on abortion which the Administration had urged the Court to overrule The Courts opinion pointedly ignored Mr Frieds widely publicized brief Bruce Fein a former Administration lawyer who has advocated a direct challenge to Miranda said he thought the taste of defeat in this and other ideologically charged cases last year had made Mr Fried gun shy of attacking other major Supreme Court precedents Mr Fried dismissed such ideas saying he had no regrets about his brief on abortion The brief was the right thing to file he said Unlike the Miranda area the law was getting worse and worse and there were dissenting voices on the Court Another Administration official said some of Mr Meeses other top aides had been more eager to mount a frontal challenge to Miranda than Mr Fried who has contended internally that chipping away at Mirandas margins was a more effective strategy than lunging at its heart The four briefs Mr Fried has filed in the past two years supporting state prosecutors in cases involving Miranda have been far more cautious and more deferential to the Supreme Court than the Attorney Generals public remarks In each of these cases Mr Fried has argued that lower courts had wrongly expanded the rights enumerated in Miranda by throwing out confessions obtained by police who had scrupulously read the defendants their rights In each case the Court ruled for the prosecution But in none of these cases did either Mr Fried or the Court suggest that Miranda itself should be reconsidered To the contrary Justice Sandra Day OConnors opinion for the Court in a decision last March said Miranda as written strikes the proper balance between societys legitimate law enforcement interests and the protection of the defendants Fifth Amendment rights This is not to say that the Supreme Courts present members agree with civil libertarians and defense lawyers that the 1966 Miranda decision was a great idea In recent years the Court has trimmed Miranda back here and there while suggesting that its rules were prophylactic safeguards against police abuse rather than integral parts of the Fifth Amendment But the Court is generally reluctant to overturn its own precedents Mr Frey suggested that Miranda has not posed such a tremendous obstacle to effective law enforcement as to give the Court an important reason to reconsider it I think Miranda was wrong but if I were the Attorney General I wouldnt even ask the Supreme Court to overrule it Mr Frey said I think a majority of the Court probably thinks it was wrong as a matter of abstract constitutional doctrine but I dont think they would vote to overrule it because I think most of them feel it would send the wrong message to the American public You Think Cops and Robbers Miranda I think to a lot of people is a symbol that we respect peoples rights some would say too elaborately but to the man in the street its an ingrained part of their view of the American system of justice Mr Frey said You think cops and robbers you think Miranda warnings Symbolism aside legal experts and Justice Department officials say it would be foolish to seize upon the first case that came along to file a brief attacking Miranda It should be one in which the facts are sympathetic to our point of view and the legal issues are clear said Terry Eastland the departments top spokesman But so far we have not had such a case he added and theres no way to predict whether there will be such a case in the remaining 23 months
THIRD-WORLD CONCERN: DEATHS DURING CHILDBIRTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/14/world/third-world-concern-deaths-during-childbirth.html,International health experts here began a campaign today to conquer a thirdworld health problem that has been largely overcome in the West the death of women in childbirth The third world is where we were in Europe and the United States at the turn of the century said Dr Halfdan Mahler Director General of the World Health Organization one of several sponsors of a Safe Motherhood conference held here this week to focus attention on what participants called a hidden tragedy At the opening session on Tuesday Barber B Conable Jr president of the World Bank challenged participants to reduce by half the number of women who die in pregnancy or childbirth by the year 2000 To further this goal Mr Conable pledged 1 million in World Bank funds for a Safe Motherhood Fund to be managed by the World Health Organization Mr Conable also promised to double World Bank lending for population health and nutrition programs to 500 million by 1990 New Research Cited Common decency tells us that it is intolerable that 1400 women die every day in the process of carrying or delivering their children said Mr Conable a former Republican Representative from upstate New York The Nairobi meeting was partly an outgrowth of a conference held here two years ago to mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women This weeks conference drew on new research and personal experiences to bring the problem of maternal mortality into focus According to the World Health Organization one quarter of all deaths of women of childbearing age in developing countries occur during pregnancy or childbirth Last year of 500000 women who died worldwide in pregnancy or childbirth 99 percent lived in underdeveloped nations An American has one chance in 6366 of dying while pregnant an East African one chance in 15 Child Dies if Mother Dies The death of a mother often means death or hardship for surviving children In Bangladesh a study found that when a mother dies in childbirth her infant has a 95 percent chance of dying within a year I remember a group of 20 women in rural Kenya telling me that three women from their community had died in childbirth said Barbara Herz an adviser to the World Bank I asked them what happened to the children They said The older ones went to the city to beg and the younger ones died  In Latin America and in urban Africa about half of maternal deaths are a result of complications arising from illicit abortions experts said Mortality could be cut by a third if women who did not want more children had access to contraceptives one study said One participant in the conference Barbara E Kwast recalled interviewing an Ethiopian tailor whose 35yearold wife had died because of an attempt to abort her 10th pregnancy He did not know anything about family planning services said Ms Kwast a professor of public health who worked in Addis Ababa from 1981 to 1985 In developing countries about half of all women go through labor and childbirth without anesthesia or trained attendants In addition twothirds of pregnant women in developing countries are believed to be anemic Several conference participants citing recent medical history were optimistic that maternal mortality rates could be reduced in underdeveloped countries In 1935 it was pointed out England and Wales had a maternal mortality rate of 400 for each 100000 live births  not much below Indias current rate of about 500 Today Britains rate is about 10 deaths for each 100000 births The difference experts here said is not economic development but the widespread extension of modern health services family planning antibiotics Caesarian sections blood transfusions and hygenic medical practices Family Planning Favored A key step participants said is access to family planning Through the 1970s many Africans criticized family planning programs as racially inspired limits on their growth But at this weeks conference which was attended by health professionals from 13 African countries the mood was heavily in favor of family planning I believe an effective populationmanagement program will considerably improve the quality of life for women and thereby insure safe motherhood President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said in the keynote speech Participants also discussed other lowcost methods for reducing maternal deaths One method that has worked successfully in several countries is building maternity waiting homes adjacent to health centers One week before her due date a woman moves with her children to one of the homes This eliminates the need to transport her from a remote site to a health center when an emergency develops unexpectedly Caesarians by Midwives Another proposal that drew much comment was a move by Dr Sambe Duale of Zaire to teach nursemidwives how to perform Caesarians if a doctor is not available In his rural area he said midwives perform 80 percent of the 200 to 300 Caesarians a year Other solutions included improving rural health centers extending ambulance service to remote areas and training community health workers to identify pregnant women at high risk Down a dirt road in the Nairobi slum of Kawangware a community of 59000 the effect of a modestly financed maternal health program could be seen Built about 10 years ago the Kabiro Health Care Outpost sends 37 healthcare workers into local shacks to explain maternal and child care I havent seen a mother die of childbirth in five years Sister Eroni Nakagwa a nursemidwife said today
AIDS Victim Married at St. Patrick's,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/aids-victim-married-at-st-patrick-s.html,With John Cardinal OConnor standing in the background Maria and David Hefner renewed their wedding vows yesterday at St Patricks Cathedral more than a month after the rector refused to allow the ceremony to take place because Mr Hefner is dying of AIDS As the Rev Gerald McGovern the couples priest performed the service Cardinal OConnor who arranged the compromise that allowed the ceremony to be performed watched from a pew near the altar Then in keeping to his promise to welcome the couple to the cathedral personally the Cardinal kissed the bride shook hands with the groom and blessed them The controversy over the Hefners wedding which received much attention from civilrights groups and Catholic and Protestant religious leaders was barely mentioned as the couple promising love and fidelity renewed their marriage vows They were married three years ago in a civil ceremony This is not just a social event among friends Father McGovern of Our Lady of the Scapular Church on East 28th Street said Love and Hope For the couple he said it is a statement of the love and the hope David and Maria have in each other To the rest of us it is a challenge Father McGovern said They cannot live their love without our support The couple who chose to renew their vows on Valentines Day exchanged rings and turned and walked down the aisle where hoards of photographers took their picture and reporters beseiged them for a comment I feel great said Mr Hefner a 38yearold hairdresser who was diagnosed eight months ago as suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome which attacks the bodys ability to fight diseases She is my life and my respect I dont have the words to say how happy and blessed I feel Im very happy and grateful said Mrs Hefner 33 who had long wanted to be married in her dream church After making arrangements for a wedding date with St Patricks officials the Hefners were told by Msgr James F Rigney the rector that people in a lifethreatening situation would receive better premarriage counseling at their local parish He canceled the couples wedding ceremony But the Cardinal reversed that decision and allowed the Hefners to renew their vows at the cathedral after they received counseling from their local priest Father McGovern Mrs Hefner has tested negative for the AIDS virus which is transmitted through sexual relations and exchanges of blood Mr Hefner has said he believes he contracted the disease in a homosexual relationship before his marriage After the ceremony yesterday Cardinal OConnor speaking at a meeting in Manhattan said he had not yet decided whether to extend throughout the New York area a decision last week by Bishop Francis J Mugavero of the Roman Catholic Diocose of Brooklyn to ban some homosexual religious groups from many of its buildings The ban was ordered by Bishop Mugavero in a letter sent to his 850 priests The Diocese covers Brooklyn and Queens In his letter Bishop Mugavero had identified Dignity a support organization of Catholic homosexuals as a group that should not be allowed to meet in the dioceses centers The Cardinal speaking to the TriState Coalition for Life a group opposed to abortion that was meeting at the Sheraton Centre Hotel said Archdiocesian officials were reviewing the propriety of a special weekly mass that is celebrated by members of Dignity at St Francis Xavier Church in Greenwich Village which is run by the Jesuit order Bishop Mugavero is a sensitive man and I know that his decision could only have been reached with great care the Cardinal said A member of the Dignity chapter at St Francis Timothy Coughlin said yesterday that the group would find another site for its weekly mass if it is unable to use the church But he said It is important to be in a Catholic setting We want to dispel the idea that you have to choose between being gay and being Catholic Mr Coughlin said We are both
IDEAS & TRENDS; BABY M ADDS URGENCY TO SEARCH FOR EQUITABLE LAWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/weekinreview/ideas-trends-baby-m-adds-urgency-to-search-for-equitable-laws.html,SURROGATE motherhood presents such troublesome ethical and legal dilemmas that most state legislatures have declined to confront the issue Those that have tried have been discouraged in their attempts to regulate the practice Most bills have died in committee while those that have survived have gone on to defeat As a result no state is believed to have a comprehensive law on surrogate motherhood though a few have statutes that can be construed as touching on the subject But experts say that the New Jersey trial for custody of Baby M a child born to a surrogate mother who changed her mind has added new urgency to the debate By pitting Mary Beth Whitehead a financially troubled surrogate mother who is married to a sanitation worker against the father William Stern a biochemist and his wife Elizabeth a pediatrician the case raises social moral and legal issues Should the affluent be allowed to hire mothers to bear their children Does a natural mothers right to her child outweigh that of the natural father How enforceable is a surrogate contract when the mother changes her mind How should the best interests of the child be determined With infertility among young people on the rise and the continuing difficulties of adoption proponents of surrogate motherhood argue for laws that would encourage the practice but establish clear guidelines particularly in respect to enforcing the contract While some opponents worry about the social implications of surrogacy others base their objections on religious grounds similar to those used to condemn abortion contraception euthanasia and other technologies of life and death and they seek legislation to uphold their positions Lacking appropriate laws the judge in the Baby M case must weigh the sanctity of a contract against the claim of the woman who has given birth Society has embarked on what has been described as a major experiment without accruing a body of law to serve as a guide Opposing Views Proposed laws generally fall into two categories While some would ban surrogacy as a form of baby selling others would legalize it as a protection of what some say is a couples constitutional right to procreate Between those extremes however lie myriad possibilities Most experts agree that the kind of legislation most likely to become law would at least define the rights and obligations of the people involved and restrict those who could sign a contract So far legislation on surrogate motherhood has been proposed in 19 states said William Pierce president of the National Committee for Adoption Three states Alabama Kentucky and Oklahoma have considered bills to prohibit the practice and 15 to allow it he said In Michigan both types of legislation have been introduced Mr Pierce an opponent of surrogate motherhood said he expected most legislatures would soon be faced with competing bills So far California has come closest to enacting legislation A bill that was passed last year by the State Assembly but that died in the Senate would have required surrogate mothers to be at least 21 years old and to have already borne a child The bill would have required medical evaluations and psychological counseling for the father his wife and the mother they hired In an attempt to quell charges of baby selling the bill would have declared money given to a surrogate compensation for her services and not payment for the child Illustrating the unlikely alliances that have formed in response to the issue the bill was opposed by feminist law groups the California Catholic Conference and the American Civil Liberties Union It was supported by several California bar associations New York Proposals Recently New York has taken the lead in surrogacy legislation with hearings held on the issue last fall and a new bill introduced earlier this month by Republicans in the State Senate It would declare legal and enforceable all surrogacy contracts that received prior approval from a judge limiting court action to questions of breach of contract The baby would be declared the legitimate child of the intended father and his wife who would have to be infertile for the couple to qualify This bill will compete with one recently reintroduced in the Assembly by a Democrat Patrick G Halpin of Lindenhurst While not banning surrogate motherhood it would discourage it by declaring illegal all payment exceeding the costs associated with pregnancy The bill would give a surrogate mother who had second thoughts 20 days after the birth of the child to request a custody hearing In New Jersey a twoyearold bill that would limit payment to a surrogate mother to 10000 has been introduced again in the State Senate but the bills sponsor Donald DiFrancesco a Republican of Essex and Union said that he expected the Legislature to go no further than establishing a commission to study the matter In Missouri Democratic legislator Christopher S Kelly recently introduced a bill that would make surrogacy contracts unenforceable but would allow undisputed agreements to be carried out in private Mr Kelly said he introduced the bill to provoke discussion and like many other legislators he expects no quick resolution to the debate Theres a natural disinclination to pass new ideas quickly he said But we have to back up and let our law catch up with our science By not deciding it turns out that we are deciding

RUTGERS GIVES HUMANITIES A LEG UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/rutgers-gives-humanities-a-leg-up.html,LEAD THINGS are popping now Dr George Levine director of Rutgers Universitys new Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture said recently as the center moved into new offices in University Hall on the New Brunswick campus THINGS are popping now Dr George Levine director of Rutgers Universitys new Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture said recently as the center moved into new offices in University Hall on the New Brunswick campus The center two years in the planning grew out of concern that the universitys traditional strength in humanities and social sciences would be lost in the shuffle of recent emphasis on science and technology a 30 million complex for biomolecular research in agriculture and five other hightechnology centers are planned This is an exciting event for both graduate students and faculty who will now have time and space to pursue research projects while receiving valuable input from other disciplines Dr Levine said in a telephone interview Fellows knowledgeable in a variety of subjects  literature science philosophy history  will share offer helpful criticisms and introduce new ideas Interested Rutgers graduate students or faculty members may apply for a yearlong fellowship at the center by submitting an application with a description of the research projects they are working on The application may be submitted to the Provosts office or graduate programs at 12 An Opinion article on teaching and scholarship at Rutgers is on Page 38 12any of the three Rutgers campuses New Brunswick Camden and Newark Selected students receive the equivalent of a teaching assistants salary for the academic year faculty members are excused from teaching one of their courses In addition a small research stipend is granted A 10member university advisory board will announce next month the selection of next years fellows In the programs first run this year 6 faculty members and 3 graduate students chosen from 50 applicants met weekly to discuss and read their individual works One fellow for example is writing a book on the arts and social activism of the 1960s Called Cults Communes and CounterCultures it will show how some of those developments have affected todays politics religion home life and workplaces Another fellow is studying the feminist movement from its beginnings to determine how it has affected major literary work Dr Levine now on a years sabbatical from his position as the Kenneth Burke Professor of English he previously was chairman of the English department and has been at Rutgers 17 years has just completed Darwin Among the Novelists a book about the science and literature of the 19th century Earlier Dr Levine wrote The Realistic Imagination which explored what novelists such as Thackery and Dickens considered realism in their time The center PU JP CENTER has goals in addition to providing a haven for special research It has been designed to bring scholars together to study a central subject For example one student from the universitys Business School is studying how organizations create their own corporate cultures and how these cultures affect business practices Culture as it pertains to the communications field was discussed and the whole subject widened to the larger question of just what culture is To date only Rutgers faculty members have been involved but it is hoped that visiting lecturers can participate in future discussions Another of the centers goals is to encourage interdisciplinary methods of teaching in university course work Todays social and political problems require interdisciplinary study to achieve lasting solutions Dr Levine said Another goal is to develop new and interesting ways to deal with todays social and cultural problems specifically to develop more comprehensive practical and rewarding research In addition to the center Rutgers has taken another step toward reaffirming and expanding its offerings in the humanities and social sciences by introducing a series of distinguished lecturers on campus Major figures of international reputation will be invited to spend a week at the university during the academic year To introduce this program Dr Richard Lewontin the Harvard geneticist spoke at the opening of the centers new offices on Feb 3 The second visitor will be Dr Edward Said of Columbia University Paar Professor of English and Comparative Literature a literary critic and authority on Middle East relations who will arrive on Feb 23 Sir Ernst Gombrich art historian author of Art and Illusion and past director of the Warburg Institute at the University of London will deliver a public lecture on March 31 The final visitor of the semester will be Dr Robert Nozick professor of philosophy at Harvard who will lecture on April 22 Each lecture will be free and given at 8 PM at the Student Center of Livingston College in Piscataway The law will be the theme for next years study at the center Subjects such as abortion choice of life and death drug testing and prayer in school will be addressed with questions such as What Did the Makers of the Constitution Mean and The Authority of the Law Does it Change With Interpretation Experience with and knowledge of law as well as that of biology philosophy history and literature will be brought to bear on the problems Dr Levine is looking forward to the growth and rich potential of the center I am excited about the possibility that what we are doing will profoundly affect the nature of teaching and research performed at the university he said For a complete lecture schedule and further information write to Deborah Greenhut the Center

RISE IN RETARTED CHILDREN PREDICTED FROM CHERNOBYL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/16/us/rise-in-retarted-children-predicted-from-chernobyl.html,Up to 13 of the 300 Soviet children born since the reactor accident at Chernobyl to women who lived nearby are expected to suffer mental retardation because of exposure to hazardous levels of radiation an American physician who recently returned from the contaminated area said here today But none of the children have been observed to have any physical defects he said The physician Dr Robert P Gale of the University of California at Los Angeles who has worked extensively with Soviet victims of the April 26 accident said 13 excess cases of retardation were expected among 300 infants born to women who were pregnant at the time of the accident and who lived within 30 kilometers of the nuclear reactor Dr Gale speaking at a news conference during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science said the estimate was derived from studies of retardation among children whose mothers were exposed to radiation in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima Children Will Be Monitored Among the 300 Soviet newborns Dr Gale said about 26 would normally be expected to suffer some kind of retardation He did not define what he meant by retardation If 13 additional cases occurred Dr Gail said the Chernobyl radiation would thus be responsible for an increase of 50 percent He stressed that 13 was the worst possible estimate and that there might be fewer additional cases Its too early to test for things of that nature Dr Gale said We will follow these children very carefully and try to identify them and eventually try to get them better schooling or do whatever we could to prevent any problems Dr Gale said none of the 300 Soviet newborns had been observed to have any physical defects because of radiation High doses of radiation can produce fetal deformation and miscarriage The radiation levels at Chernobyl were apparently too low to produce serious problems But Dr Gale said abortions had been performed on pregnant women living near the reactor He said he did not know the number and added that he had been told Soviet officials did not know Confusing the Brain Cells Weve now had a chance to observe all the children that have been born close to Chernobyl Dr Gale said Not surprisingly none of them at birth at least has any detectable abnormalites We werent expecting any Thats an example that no news is good news The effects of radiation on the fetal brain are thought to be most extreme at 8 to 15 weeks of development Dr Gale said At the eighth week of development the brain cells which are all clustered together migrate out to form the structure of the adult brain he said If you irradiate an animal or human at that stage of development you confuse the cells so they migrate to the wrong place Dr Gale said the United States Department of Energy would soon publish a paper on the number of cases of retardation expected to be caused by the Chernobyl accident Shortly after the accident Dr Gale was called to the Soviet Union to do bone marrow transplants on 13 of the most seriously irradiated victims of the disaster two survived Dr Gale who is coordinating longterm studies of the accidents health effects has made repeated visits to the Soviet Union He said he was stunned by the devastation of the area around Chernobyl which he visited again within the last two weeks Devoid of Human Life Its one thing to talk about deserted zones and another to drive into a 3000squarekilometer area just completely devoid of human life to fly over an entire forest which is brown because the trees are radioactive he said It has a tremendous emotional impact Its unavoidable when you see these things that you understand the potential dangers of radiation Dr Gale said the deserted villages within the 30kilometer safety zone 30 kilometers is about 19 miles were covered with snow and many of them were probably safe enough to be reinhabited He added however that the radioactive debris in the deep snow would be a problem in the spring when the snow melts and flows into rivers and reservoirs Soviet officials have decided to bar villagers from their former homes until after the spring melt he said Many people are trying to get back to their houses Dr Gale said People see their homes and they see no destruction no fire they just see their houses standing there and they want to go back to them So they sort of sneak in on occasion Weighing Risk of Other Sources Dr Gale said Soviet officials far from being put off by the Chernobyl accident were planning to expand their reliance on nuclear power Their goal he said was to increase nuclear production from 11 percent its current rate to 50 percent of all energy generated in the Soviet Union from the current level of 11 percent The risks of nuclear power although great in some cases have to be weighed against those of other energy technologies he said For instance if the Soviet Union gave up its nuclear power program and relied on fossil fuels it could expect 1 million more deaths over 50 years because of increased production accidents and pollution he said Every kind of energy has its price he said Chernobyl is probably going to cost them 12000 lives from excess cancer deaths in the Soviet Union If they have no more Chernobyls he said then having switched to fossil fuels will cost them almost a million more lives On the other hand they could have another Chernobyl tomorrow
"WASHINGTON TALK; TWO JOBS FOR BIDEN: NO MOONLIGHTING, THIS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/16/us/washington-talk-two-jobs-for-biden-no-moonlighting-this.html,For the moment Senator Joseph R Biden Jr holds two of the most demanding jobs on Capitol Hill  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and 1988 Presidential candidate The question is can the Delaware Democrat really do both And if he tries will the Judiciary Committee suffer Theres a strong feeling  I have an instinctual feeling  I can do both he said in a conversation the other day Im not going to rule out anything Were moving along on this operation the political operation as if both are going to take place But to be blunt I dont know It may very well be that it just cannot be done Possibilities and Pitfalls It is a dilemma full of possibilities and pitfalls that Senator Biden has been contemplating since the Democrats won control of the Senate in the elections last November Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts the Judiciary Committees senior Democrat decided last year to become chairman of another committee leaving the Judiciary post to his sometime rival Mr Biden acknowledges that one question seems close to an answer If it came down to a choice between running for President and running the committee it probably has to be 88 rather than the committee he said The committee has a full agenda involving everything from immigration to the death penalty to scores of nominations to the Federal bench And Senator Bidens quandary comes too as the Democrats are beginning to reorganize the panel after six years of Republican control If he gives up the committee Senator Howard M Metzenbaum an Ohio Democrat who is one of the most liberal members of the Senate is next in line to be chairman Not If But How Mr Biden is looking more and more like a candidate and he is expected to announce in the next two weeks that he is forming an exploratory campaign committee He made clear that he would seek the White House in comparing himself to a potential opponent Governor Cuomo of New York The difference between Cuomo and me as I read Cuomo is that Im not trying to figure out if  Mr Biden said Im trying to figure out how  Another sign of an imminent candidacy The Senator said he had urged his son Beau to enroll next fall as a freshman at the Univerity of Pennsylvania A proud parent who bypasses the cocktail circuit and returns home to Delaware every night Senator Biden noted that the school was near Philadelphias airport meaning that Beau would be able to join his father quickly as the Senator jets across the continent while campaigning Mr Biden likes the idea of running the Judiciary Committee and talks excitedly about the opportunity to battle with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d over the Justice Departments vigorously debated civil rights policies and judicial nominations He appears to relish the thought of newly rigorous Congressional oversight and in his voice there is clear contempt for the department under President Reagan This is the first group of people to have the chutzpah to treat the Congress and the Senate as if it were irrelevant he said Theres this highhandedness that basically says look we dont have to play by the rules Yet whatever his interest in taming Mr Meese it is still politics especially Presidential politics that enlivens a conversation with the Senator His press notices have recently has been good Political columnists have praised him for youthful energy now 44 years old he was first elected to the Senate in 1972  and his persuasive if rambling speaking style The pundits also see appeal in their inability to peg him on important issues Senator Biden is not always in the liberals corner While supporting a womans right to have an abortion he generally opposes Federal financing of abortions While he has led the fight against some of Mr Reagans judicial nominees he voted to approve several staunch conservatives including Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court To the dismay of civil rights leaders who are still complaining he delayed a decision last summer on whether to support the nomination of William H Rehnquist to be Chief Justice the Senator eventually voted against him Asked about his chances in the campaign next year Mr Biden sat back in his office chair and seemed to imagine himself a political reporter weighing the Biden candidacy Youre chairman of the Judiciary Committee he said of himself Youre kind of interesting because youre an enigma They dont quite know who you are They wonder if you have the legs whether youre substantive or not Job Can Cure the Rap It is the question of substance that has bedeviled Mr Biden Colleagues on the Hill privately question whether Senator Biden  who is seen perhaps unfairly as having a modest legislative record  deserves a shot at the Presidency The Senator understands the liability and it is one that makes the Judiciary Committee post all the more appealing The chairmanship has the ability to cure the only rap on me that could be of any consequence he said adding If youre an effective chairman of any committee how can you not be substantive It sort of de facto deals with that I think the job clearly helps me politically  other than time he said Indeed the time commitment of the job is his other problem Over the next year the Judiciary Committee which deals with a quarter of all legislation that comes before the Senate is expected to face a range of critical issues Most important the Senator said is the committees review of an anticipated flood of judicial nominations from the Justice Department The single most important reality we have is judges he said Last year Senator Biden and other Democrats led the charge against a number of bench nominees including Jefferson B Sessions 3d an Alabama prosecutor who was eventually rejected because of senators concern about his sensitivity toward blacks Panels Major Reorganization But while a battle over nominations may work to Mr Bidens political advantage it would take time and he knows he could face a backlash from Democrats if he is seen as slighting the committee for his campaign The Judiciary chairmanship will be a special burden as the Democrats reorganize the panel after six years under the leadership of Senator Strom Thurmond a fiercely conservative South Carolina Republican Its not like I am in the third year of a chairmanship with the staff and committee up and running Mr Biden said This is the first reorganization in six years and its a major reorganization Among other things the chairman has had to hire new staff and shuffle the committee members among the subcommittees As he talked Senator Biden pulled out a copy of the committees calendar for February Several days of the month were already blocked out for hearings Lining Up the Calendars He said he had asked aides to prepare four similar calendars for the coming months one for travel to Iowa and New Hampshire one for travel through the politically important South one for press engagements and one for fundraising appearances The idea is to line up the calendars and see if he can do it all without sacrificing the work of the Judiciary Committee or as he puts it blowing my own head off I know what the answer is going to be Mr Biden said smiling weakly as he looked over one of the schedules Its that its going to require 45 days a month

Supreme Courts newest and most outgoing member did both with gusto at symposium before several hundred students at Tulane University here Sunday night In the process he made clear his distaste for disclosures of national security secrets to the press and his willingess to bar publication of such secrets at least in an extreme case His remarks came in a discussion with six other panelists of a hypothetical case in 1992 about a highlevel Government officials unauthorized disclosure to a television network of a Presidential plan to invade a foreign nation rich in oil to rescue some hostages As described by Fred W Friendly the moderator another purpose of the planned invasion was to seize oilfields so as to relieve an economic crisis and energy shortage in the United States How Should the Court Rule Justice Scalia was asked by Mr Friendly a former president of CBS News how the Supreme Court should rule if the Government asked it in an unprecedented secret hearing to order the hypothetical network not to broadcast the information for 12 hours so that the operation could go forward in secret This is not a case that the press is going to win the Justice responded I think where the President is conducting military operations I think the Court out of respect for the political branches is not going to try to secondguess the need for secrecy in those military operations He added Its a narrow situation its a troop ship situation and in these circumstances and for a limited time period a prior restraint should issue Justice Scalia also referred to the person who disclosed the Government information in the hypothetical case as some fink in the Defense Department And he said the reporter whom Mr Friendly said had been given the secret plan unsolicited had suborned this information out of some public servant who was violating his duty Making his points in goodnatured but forceful tones the former law professor sometimes leaned back with arms folded At one point he hunched forward on the front of his chair like a coiled spring waiting to rebut an argument made by Burt Neuborne a New York University law professor and noted civil liberties lawyer The Supreme Court has never upheld a prior restraint on publication of Government secrets In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case it rejected by 6 to 3 the Nixon Administrations request for an order barring publication by The New York Times and others of a classified study of the Vietnam War But the Court has suggested it might issue a prior restraint if necessary to avert grave and imminent harm to the national security And the two Federal appellate judges who took part in the Tulane discussion agreed with Justice Scalias view that Mr Friendlys hypothetical case qualified They were Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge John Minor Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Even Floyd Abrams a prominent First Amendment advocate for news organizations who helped represent The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case conceded at the symposium that the press was unlikely to win Mr Friendlys hypothetical case But Mr Abrams disputed a statement by Justice Scalia that the absence of a declaration of war by Congress was totally irrelevant to analysis of Mr Friendlys case in which the White House had informed only one member of Congress of the planned operation Were Talking About a Dictum Justice Scalia had said no inference that a Congressional declaration might be necessary could be drawn from a 1931 statement by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in Near v Minnesota that the general rule against prior restraints was subject to an exception when a nation is at war to prevent publication of such information as the sailing dates of troop ships Lookit I dont know why were getting onto this Justice Scalia said Were talking about a dictum you know an offhand remark in a case and when hes talking about troop shipments in time of war it seems to me the fair import of it is that when the armed forces of the United States are at risk there is an exception to the general rule I dont think it makes a bit of difference whether its a declared war or an undeclared war Mr Abrams said he thought any argument by the Government that publication would necessarily jeopardize the lives of American soldiers had been weakened since there was not a declared war in progress and the operation might be aborted entirely if the plan were disclosed Earlier Mr Friendly had remarked that in my copy of the Constitution and in Justice Scalias copy it says that only Congress can declare war Not in Justice Scalias copy Mr Abrams interjected provoking a round of laughter from the audience and a smile from the butt of his joke Another Hypothetical Case In discussing another hypothetical case Justice Scalia said that if a reporter learned that a prominent opponent of abortion who was a candidate for a Cabinet appointment had herself had an illegal abortion when she was 14 the reporter shouldnt print the story He said the fact the woman had had an abortion as a child had very little to do with the womans qualifications for the office But he said a lot of things that are constitutional are quite reprehensible And when asked whether as a judge he would issue a prior restraint barring the reporter from exposing the abortion Justice Scalia said No I wouldnt restrain it Let him be reprehensible Many of the students applauded loudly when other panelists disputed Justice Scalias views on the importance of government secrecy and his arguments against publishing the abortion article But the loudest applause came at the end when Mr Friendly thanking the panelists said It takes a hell of a Justice to sit here and put up with all this
PERSONAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/garden/personal-health-642387.html,IT wasnt easy for the 6yearold boy to tell his mother that her stepbrother was abusing him physically and sexually It was even harder when she told him to stop telling lies Only when the boy eventually told a teacher who intervened did the mother take her son seriously and force the stepbrother to move out An 11yearold girl burst into tears during a film on problem touching and ran from the room She later confided to an instructor that her two brothers had been abusing her sexually for four years but she had been afraid to tell anyone about it These and many other instances of the sexual abuse of children have come to light recently through a comprehensive program developed by the Girls Club of Omaha and now being disseminated under a Federal grant to youth organizations nationwide The goal of the program called KidAbility is to protect boys and girls against such abuse and give them the support they need to report all instances Through the program children learn how to spot potential trouble how to act assertively to rebuff it and what to do if it occurs KidAbility also seeks to help parents do a better job of preventing recognizing and coping with abuse The need for such programs is evident from the findings of a detailed 1981 study of 521 parents led by Dr David Finkelhor director of the Family Violence Research Program at the University of New Hampshire The study revealed the following  Although almost all parents caution their children against potential kidnapping an extremely rare event and warn them to be wary of strangers very few give advice about the much more likely possibility of sexual abuse and that the offender might be someone they know  Parents find it easier to talk about such subjects as death pregnancy and birth homosexuality sexual intercourse suicide and abortion than about sexual abuse  Many if not most parents believe their children face little danger of being abused that they are too young to be told of the possibility and that discussions of the subject will frighten the children unnecessarily The facts belie such parental attitudes and beliefs An estimated one in four girls and at least one in seven boys is sexually abused one or more times before age 18 Dr Finkelhor said 39 percent of children who told of abuse were boys Abuse can start as young as 2 months old with the most vulnerable years between 6 and 8 Yet parents in the study picked 9 as the best age to talk about sexual abuse those who had 9yearolds picked age 10 those with 10yearolds picked 11 and so forth Such abuse occurs in all kinds of families urban suburban and rural rich and poor professional and bluecollar married and divorced welleducated and poorly educated Further 75 to 85 percent of the cases involve a relative or someone the child knows and often trusts Children are much less likely to report abuse when the offender is known Even when they do report it chances are they wont be believed at least not at first And even when no doubts are raised Dr Finkelhor found most parents do not report the abuse to any authority or agency capable of helping the child understand what happened and cope with the inevitable emotional scars Dr Finkelhor and the Girls Clubs of America say that childrens lack of knowledge and uncertainty about behavior often lead to their victimization Children often believe offenders who tell them the sexual activity is all right They can be thrown off guard by an adults unexpected behavior An indepth study among 20 abused girls by Jane F Gilgun at the University of Minnesota found that some believed the abuse was their own fault even if they were threatened or beaten into submission The girls also believed they had to obey the requests of adults and that disclosing the abuse would get them into trouble Some children had no idea what was happening TALKING WITH YOUR CHILD Even parents who are uncomfortable talking about sex can protect their children Though it is not necessary to give explicit sexual details make clear what kind of abuse youre talking about The KidAbility selfprotection program suggests the following  Distinguish between affectionate touching and problem touching An affectionate hug or touch should create a warm good feeling and never has to be kept secret or hidden Problem touches include anything that makes the child feel bad confused embarrassed guilty or afraid as well as any touch forced on the child or involving body parts normally covered by a bathing suit  Teach children how to recognize and cope with unsafe situations Help them understand the difference between a gift unconditional and a bribe it always has a price a surprise a temporary secret and a secret to be kept permanently Say its never all right to keep secrets about touching Teach them what to say and do if they are home alone and the doorbell or telephone rings  Through playacting help children practice acting assertively to put a quick stop to unwanted overtures No Stop that I dont like that Dont touch me like that That hurts I want you to stop Teach them to walk away quickly then and if possible go home  Help children identify people they can ask for help and to learn how to ask so they wont be ignored List the names of adults that children feel they can talk to Have them practice reporting a problem in an assertive way such as Would you help me with a problem Someone is touching me on the private parts of my body and I dont like it Teach them too that if the first adult they tell doesnt believe them or does nothing about it they must keep asking others SIGNS OF ABUSE Even when children dont tell of abuse their behavior often changes They may become very depressed regress to infantile behavior such as thumbsucking or bedwetting or become belligerent When the offender is someone who is trusted or idolized the child may lose faith in everyone According to Maggie Clune and Marsha Heiman directors of the sexual abuse and incest consultation project at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey other signs of abuse include these sexual behavior or knowledge inappropriate to the childs age fear of a particular adult or place fear of separation withdrawal or clinging mood changes nightmares or difficulty sleeping physical complaints such as stomachaches headaches or rashes or pain in the genital area IF A CHILD IS MOLESTED How you respond when a child tells of sexual abuse may be critical The KidAbility program suggests trying not to act too shocked Tell the child you believe him or her say the child is not to blame for what happened and offer praise for telling you about it Say also that you will try to get help by telling someone about it who knows what to do Then report the suspected molestation to the local Child Protection Service or law enforcement agency To minimize emotional harm to the child look for a public or private agency experienced in this problem where the child can go for counseling You can talk with either a local agency that offers child protective services or your health department or department of social services You might also want to consult a child psychologist or psychiatrist experienced in dealing with the sexual abuse of children SOURCES OF FURTHER INFORMATION VARIOUS resources books workbooks

WASHINGTON TALK: WORKING PROFILE; The Man Behind the Medicare Expansion Plan: Thomas R. Burke,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/us/washington-talk-working-profile-man-behind-medicare-expansion-plan-thomas-r.html,When President Reagan proposed a new health insurance program for catastrophic illness it was widely seen as a victory for Dr Otis R Bowen the Secretary of Health and Human Services But it was equally a victory for Dr Bowens bluff bluntspoken chief of staff Thomas R Burke In fact the Reagan plan for expanding Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses was previously known as the BowenBurke plan because the two men devised it when Dr Bowen was chairman of a Federal advisory committee studying Medicare in 198284 Medicare finances health care for 31 million elderly and disabled people at a cost of more than 70 billion a year Doc Bowen is short softspoken mildmannered and unassuming He Sometimes feathers have to be ruffled You cant make an omelet without breaking eggs has the downhome style of a country doctor from Bremen Ind who rose to be Governor of his state but never forgot his roots Mr Burke is the Secretarys enforcer Those who know and deal with him say he can be harsh brusque insulting even abusive He would rather insult first and think later about the substance of an issue said Peter J Ferrara a Washington lawyer who used to work as a domestic policy adviser to President Reagan Richard W Rahn vice president and chief economist at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States recalled a meeting with the two in March 1986 Tom was his bellicose self and Bowen as always was a courtly gentleman Mr Rahn also said that he was astounded that Burke has remained on the job as long as he has given all the folks hes alienated For his part Mr Burke a 48yearold health economist counters that he does not insult anyone intentionally But sometimes feathers have to be ruffled he said You cant make an omelet without breaking eggs To be sure I have enemies But I couldnt do this job if I tried to make everybody my friend The BowenBurke team appears to be an effective model for Government managers at other agencies The Secretary has resisted demands from conservatives in the White House and elsewhere that he dismiss his chief of staff Mr Burke said he and Dr Bowen hit it off enormously well when they worked together on the Medicare advisory committee When Dr Bowen was named Secretary in November 1985 he was not particularly wise in the ways of Washington but he chose Mr Burke to be his chief of staff and Mr Burke knew how the Federal bureaucracy operates Mr Burke worked on health affairs at the Defense Department from 1975 to 1981 then switched to the Department of Health and Human Services after the Reagan Administration took office Now he retains a military manner as he tries to whip the troops into line at the Department of Health and Human Services a sprawling bureaucracy with a budget of 348 billion a year about 18 percent more than the Pentagons A Federal health official said that for Mr Burke politeness is a means to delay and he added Tom cuts through the normal bureaucratic inertia and makes things happen even if he has to bully or threaten people In the fight over expansion of Medicare many people were surprised that Dr Bowen prevailed over such formidable foes as Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and James C Miller 3d director of the Office of Management and Budget The critics had argued that a new Federal health program could be expensive and would take business away from the private health insurance industry Dr Bowens charm tenacity and political skills combined with Mr Burkes barrelchested belligerence mowed down opposition within the Administration And the White House is soon expected to submit its version of the BowenBurke plan to Congress Human Events which calls itself the national conservative weekly accurately described the situation Bowen Upsets Conservatives on Key Issues it said in a frontpage headline this month Mr Burke irritates ideological conservatives even more Paul M Weyrich speaking on behalf of a coalition of conservative groups complained that Mr Burke had harassed Jo Ann Gasper a Public Health Service official who tried to halt the distribution of Federal funds to family planning clinics operated by Planned Parenthood She asserted that some of the clinics encouraged abortions a charge they denied In a letter dated Feb 9 Mr Weyrich who is president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation told Dr Bowen This is not the Soviet Union Your chief of staff has no right to do this and we are prepared to use every means legal and political to get it stopped We further demand that Tom Burke be fired immediately Mr Weyrich wrote If you fail to act we will initiate whatever action is appropriate to force his removal from office Stuart M Butler director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation a conservative research institute said that Mr Burke locked horns immediately with conservative supporters of the Administration Though he often disagrees with them Mr Butler said Dr Bowen and Tom Burke are a good combination Bowen is a charming man He charmed people on Capitol Hill Burke is a tough confrontational aggressive insider He knew how to deal with the corridors of power in Washington He did a lot of the tough nasty work and did it very well People Call Me a Socialist As chief of staff Mr Burke said he prepares a polished set of options for the Secretary to consider on major issues In addition he said I keep the mail moving clean out backlogs and manage the department while the Secretary is out making speeches or attending social engagements People call me a socialist a pinko an abortionist Mr Burke said But he insists Im a conservative I didnt vote for Jack Kennedy I couldnt stand the guy However Mr Butler said there was no indication whatsoever in his deeds or his positions that Mr Burke was a conservative Mr Burke worked for Carolyne K Davis when she ran Medicare and Medicaid in the early years of the Reagan Administration She pointed out that while at the Defense Department he had developed a hierarchical concept of management When the colonel gives a command everybody carries it out As a result Dr Davis said Mr Burke was exactly what you need in a chief of staff someone who can meet goals and deadlines without a great deal of frivolous conversation

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/19/garden/hers.html,LEAD MEN think sex is funny Women think sex is funny also  up to a point MEN think sex is funny Women think sex is funny also  up to a point It starts early Three days into the new semester my 10yearold daughter came home upset about the subject of sex at least as presented in health class The reason the class was coed And the boys laughed They also snickered joked made other funny sounds and generally got big eyes at the mention of such perennial hits as ova uterus and Fallopian tubes I hope I said looking over the vocabulary list and diagrams that the girls laughed their heads off when the teacher got to spermatozoa vas deferens and testes Later I realized that this was perhaps not the most mature thing to suggest but in any case my daughter was up to it Nooooo she growled in her ImapreadolescentandjustwaituntilImateenager voice The boys laughed at that stuff too Fun is fun and a few giggles never hurt anyone but my daughters attitude toward sex had changed from one of tolerant distaste normal for her age to angry embarrassment It is the job of mothers to worry three weeks later there was a meeting on the health curriculum and I went Opinions ricocheted through the gathering like hyperactive pheromones but two points emerged One was that nobody agrees on how sex education should be presented Some parents want a program that terrifies children into abstinence but only until they get married they think ignorance is innocence and that information about sex ends For the next few weeks the Hers column will be written by Susan Ferraro a magazine writer and columnist childhood Others say that since sex is normal it should not be a sensitive issue even though the overflow crowd and their own careful statements suggested otherwise The second point was that though a fair number of men attended the meeting it was a womans issue Only three male parents spoke at all  one who called for order one who asked plaintively if all the diagrams werent too much too soon and one a local politician who made points with conservatives when he asked who was going to teach the fourth R  religion One exchange summed up the roles men and women played A woman noted that it was the 1980s and said that she and her children talk about sex all the time even at the dinner table A male voice growled Im glad I dont eat at her house A Time magazine poll later verified what wed seen with our own eyes sex education is a job that falls to mothers not fathers For example only 17 percent of fathers polled had talked to their 8to12yearolds about birth control compared with 26 percent of mothers We know men like sex I once read that they think about it every 19 seconds They dont want to talk about it however  not seriously with children As I know only too well When my daughter was 5 she asked her father how the sperm gets to the egg I later learned that she imagined the sperm which looked to her like a small nose trudging alone across the great expanse of the sheet to the mother while the parents slept together His answer Magic Very funny In fact I hope it is in some degree true But now when the children ask they ask me I keep the answers simple and until I found out what was going on in the schools I waited for them to bring up the subject So far weve covered separately or together conception birth control menstruation abortion venereal diseases including AIDS and how it is transmitted homosexuality hormones feelings and privacy My son who is two years younger has fewer questions I dont stint on my personal opinion and values I warn them about sexually transmitted diseases the same way I warn them about drugs They both insisted on being told privately about their bodies they felt this information belonged to them not a despised sibling of the opposite sex Have I robbed them of their childhood No My son still hates all girls going so far as to rub off my goodmorning kiss if I have the bad manners to deliver it at the bus stop in public When my daughter found herself sitting next to a boy at the school breakfast she leaned so far away she fell off her stool In fact I think its better to tell them early when they are in their latency period  it may be a parents only chance Right now they listen sometimes when I speak They still think I know a few things In three years they will know in every fiber of their beings that anything I have to say is ridiculous Now I can give information in ways that dont violate their natural reserve and personal feelings Still the issue is a touchy one One day still billowing steam I ran into a friend and told him all about it The boys laugh but theyre only 10 and 11 Maybe it will get better later on No my friend said smiling like Buddha The boys will laugh then They will also laugh when they are 22 35 49 and 78 This is funny Sex is funny It is slapstick funny like Mel Brooks and it is angst funny like Woody Allen I didnt get it Dont you think sex has er a spiritual side to it Of course that was the wrong word I should have said emotional or meaningful But my affable friend was shaping a reply anyway Yes sex can be spiritual he announced looking into the distance If youre religious After my daughter got an A on her sexeducation test she efficiently put it away from herself by forgetting what she hadnt learned at home Did things ever settle down I asked her looking over the exam Did the boys stop laughing No she replied But of course they think its funny Were the ones who get pregnant Of course And may she never forget it

country in which newspapers under the Somoza regime printed photographs of Marilyn Monroe and other Hollywood movie stars in place of the banned articles a country in which 19yearold soldiers can be veterans with six years fighting experience a country in which a tree across the road becomes an ominous and frightening sight And yet reports Mr Rushdie literature continues to flourish in this warravaged land Many of the countrys leaders  including President Ortega whose most popular work was called I Missed Managua in Miniskirts and Minister of Culture Ernesto Cardenal  are also wellknown poets and debates over declining standards in verse coexist happily with more overtly political discussions Near the end of his travels Mr Rushdie wonders about the relative absence of novelists in this poetstuffed country There was never time for novels a poet explains You could squeeze in poetry between other things Not a novel
THE RIGHT TO LIE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/21/opinion/the-right-to-lie.html,More than 100 law enforcement agents are now searching for Dennis Malvasi a suspect in recent dynamite attacks against New York City abortion clinics He is a fireworks expert who worked on last years Statue of Liberty celebrations and is described as clever elusive and experienced A similar description could well be applied to other prolife zealots to judge by a recent hearing before a House subcommittee These activists prefer deceit to violence When Carla Abbotts decided to terminate her pregnancy for instance she looked up clinics in the San Francisco phone book and chose one called A Free Pregnancy Center She told a counselor she wanted an abortion and was shown a slide show that had pictures of bloody fetuses in trash cans and it said abortion led to sterility death deformed children and even suicide because of guilt Ann Gillespie of Texas and Diana Kulda of Florida whod also gone to what they believed were abortion clinics had similar experiences Angel Weatherman from South Dakota wasnt shown slides  merely told by her counselor that she would go to hell The counselor also squealed on Ms Weatherman to her pastor who dismissed her from her job as a music director All these women were worldly enough to realize that the clinics were fake and went elsewhere for abortions But a 15yearold San Franciscan Jane Doe looked up a clinic in the phone book was terrified by the same slide show and told to come back for further tests She did for months dissuaded every time from going to another clinic Eventually it was too late for an abortion The child was given up for adoption In San Francisco lawyers for Ms Abbotts and Jane Doe are suing on the basis of false advertising and unfair business practices and have won a temporary restraining order barring further advertising without the term abortion alternatives The District Attorneys consumer fraud department has also filed suit In Texas another such center and its founder were found guilty of deceptive trade practices and fined 39000 Three New York City centers have been investigated by the State Attorney General Robert Abrams and a negotiated settlement is expected soon Nearly a dozen similar suits are still pending around the country Meanwhile the socalled clinics most of whose staff members have no medical training proliferate There are probably 2000 of them Robert J Pearson who is affiliated with the New York centers and whose foundation created the slide show admits that the centers that use it dont openly acknowledge that they are run by antiabortionists We dont hold a flag in our door saying we are prolife he says But its honest advertising Were just not saying what we dont do But women are certainly entitled to know whether a clinic is prepared to offer a full range of medical advice or pseudomedical tirades As Stephen Gardner who successfully prosecuted a Texas center put it The issue is not right to life the issue is whether these clinics have a right to lie
YALE CHIEF OPENS CONSTITUTION TALKS BY FAULTING MEESE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/nyregion/yale-chief-opens-constitution-talks-by-faulting-meese.html,The president of Yale University in the first of a series of lectures by experts on the United States Constitution has assailed the views of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d as too rigid History is not so simple and not so static said the Yale president Benno C Schmidt Jr in a speech Thursday before a soldout audience of 900 at the 92d Street Y Mr Schmidt a former professor of constitutional law at Columbia University delivered the keynote address for the series which is part of New York Citys commemoration of the bicentennial of the Constitution Meese View Called Unworkable Richard B Morris a Columbia University historian stressed in opening remarks that constitutional issues always controversial continue to sharply divide Americans Among other issues he cited the death penalty abortion and the role of religion in schools Mr Schmidts remarks further underlined the topicality of the Constitution In essence he argued that what Mr Meese calls jurisprudence of original intention is unworkable Buttressed by generally conservative legal experts Mr Meese has repeatedly argued that constitutional interpretations should be based on the exact language of the Constitution The language they chose meant something Mr Meese once said The Yale president agreed the original language has to be the basis for understanding the Constitution but insisted that it must be combined with sophistication skepticism and tolerance for ambiguity  all in the context of history He specifically contended that the 14th Amendment guaranteeing due process was deliberately cast in indeterminate terms in order to forge the Congressional compromise necessary to pass it Schmidt Offer Examples The task of judges therefore is to respond to changed or changing circumstances while refraining from unfettered judicial discretion he said Mr Schmidt cited three examples to illustrate how a rigid constitutional interpretation can be incorrect The first was the contention of President Richard M Nixons lawyers in the Watergate scandal that impeachment and removal from office could only follow treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors Mr Schmidt said that while this language supported Mr Nixons arguments an examination of English predecents as well as language recorded at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia 200 years ago proved the founders intended a considerably more liberal interpretation Mr Schmidt quoted Benjamin Franklin as saying the impeachment mechanism was necessary when the President had rendered himself obnoxious so as to prevent the drastic remedy of assassination Franklin made no reference to the commission of crimes Mr Schmidt said The second example was the treatment of seditious libel meaning slander against the Government that might undermine its stability or survival Under this definition truthful criticism must be regarded as particularly lethal Mr Schmidt said Series of Verdicts Cited He argued that the First Amendment as written did not repudiate the law of seditious libel But a succession of jury verdicts during the 18th century upholding the right to criticize the Government gradually weakened the law he said in effect changing the original scope of the First Amendment Mr Schmidts third example was the gradual evolution of the 14th Amendment as a weapon against racial discrimination Despite the clear probability that its authors did not intend it as such he said the Amendments general language allowed it to be used to spur a revolution in race relations In a discussion after Mr Schmidts speech Mr Morris cited yet another reason why he said the founders intention should not be used as a basis for constitutional decisions Because the convention was secret and only fragmentary notes were kept by a few participants there exist what he termed great silences about the drafters thoughts These great silences he said speak for themselves and indicate the impossibility of determining what the founding fathers precisely meant
"AS CATHOLICS MEET CONTROVERSY, CONTRASTING STYLES EMERGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/weekinreview/as-catholics-meet-controversy-contrasting-styles-emerge.html,WHEN Bishop Francis J Mugavero of Brooklyn told his priests earlier this month that they could no longer hold special masses for Dignity a Catholic homosexual group he seemed to be stepping uncharacteristically out in front of John Cardinal OConnor of New York After all although Cardinal OConnor said last Sunday that he agreed with the Bishops decision a church in the Cardinals archdiocese was continuing to hold masses for the group A closer look revealed however that Bishop Mugavero had gone no further in his diocese which comprises Brooklyn and Queens than had Cardinal OConnor in his archdiocese which comprises Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and Westchester Dutchess Orange Rockland Ulster Sullivan and Putnam Counties St Francis Xavier the Greenwich Village church that permits Dignity to hold its own masses is run by the Jesuit order the Cardinals authority over it is not total but subject to negotiation with the Jesuit provincial Moreover Bishop Mugavero had not acted until some months after a Vatican document last October instructed bishops to withdraw support from homosexual groups that do not follow the teachings of the church Nonetheless it came as a surprise to many in the church that it was the Bishop and not the Cardinal who made headlines by barring groups that condone homosexual activity Bishop Mugavero has been regarded as somewhat more liberal and less confrontational than Cardinal OConnor in matters relating to social issues and this contrast reflects underlying differences between the two prelates in personality experience and governing style and also the differences in tradition and relative prominence of the dioceses they lead The contrast was made evident in recent months when a Federal court agreement required foster care agencies to provide children with birth control and abortion counseling The Cardinal warned in a speech and in a newspaper column that he might discontinue some of the churchs grouphome programs rather than comply Such a decision would affect about 2400 children living in Archdiocesan group homes Bishop Mugavero just quietly let city officials know that he too disliked the agreement he now is planning a meeting in April to counsel Brooklyns independent Catholic foster care agencies which will decide on their own how to respond Similarly when two Roman Catholic politicians from Queens Governor Cuomo and VicePresidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro said they would not object to Medicaid financing for abortions it was Cardinal OConnor  not their own Bishop  who publicly challenged them One school of thought traces the contrast between the Brooklyn and New York prelates to the fact that Cardinal OConnor 67 years old and Archbishop for only three years was shaped by more than 30 years in the military chaplaincy Bishop Mugavero 72 years old and Bishop since 1968 spent 25 years of his priesthood working in Catholic Charities and other social services Bishop Mugavero is a very quiet personal very selfeffacing person said Msgr Joseph P Bynon pastor of Resurrection Ascension Church in Queens and a former diocesan superintendent of schools He doesnt get involved in these very controversial things By contrast Cardinal OConnor often seems to bask in media attention Some priests say that in Cardinal OConnors place Bishop Mugavero would never have caused the turmoil that surrounded the Cardinals recent trip to the Middle East with his controversial statements about Palestinian selfdetermination and the Holocaust I think Cardinal OConnor is a natural communicator and he uses every means at his disposal to express these views said Msgr Edwin F OBrien rector of St Josephs Seminary in Yonkers For years he observed the scene and saw a lot of confusion on what the church teaches and he found that somewhat frustrating And now that he has the opportunity to present the churchs position on things he feels obliged to do so Indeed Monsignor OBrien suggested that Cardinal OConnor as head of an archdiocese in a world business and media center must play that role The archdiocese is seen as the flagship of the church of this part of the country Monsignor OBrien said Francis Cardinal Spellman the New York Archbishop from 1939 to 1967 involved himself in public policy to such a degree that he became identified with support for the Vietnam War at a time when popular support was fading However his successor and Cardinal OConnors predecessor Terence Cardinal Cooke Archbishop until 1983 was said to feel uncomfortable in the limelight Brooklyn has long been known as the more liberal of the two dioceses Msgr Harry J Byrne a former cochancellor one of two chief administrators of the New York Archdiocese said for example that Brooklyns diocesan marriage tribunal had been known for a more open and a more liberal approach in annulling marriages The same sort of spirit and gutsiness that made such ardent fans of the Brooklyn Dodgers is reflected in the life of Brooklyn and affects the church said the Rev James Hinchey copastor of St James Cathedral in Brooklyn Peter Steinfels editor of Commonweal magazine the Catholic review said it is his impression that the Brooklyn diocese believes that a greater amount of compromise and accommodation is still within the bounds of Catholic teaching He added that in the political arena there may be some feeling in the New York Archdiocese that they have lost political clout over the years and simply to defend their own institutional interests they needed to become more assertive
ANXIOUS WAITING; A GLOOMY WHITE HOUSE BRACES FOR THE JUDGMENTS IN TOWER PANEL'S REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/weekinreview/anxious-waiting-gloomy-white-house-braces-for-judgments-tower-panel-s-report.html,AS the dispiriting distractions of the Irancontra affair continued to swirl around the White House last week President Reagan and his aides mounted a determined effort to demonstrate that they were still in charge But all efforts to get on with the normal business of government have been clouded by the knowledge that the special board reviewing the Irancontra affair is likely to deliver a scathing critique of the Administrations performance when it reports Thursday The mood of apprehension was reflected by one White House official who said Your whole day your whole week your whole month is taken up dealing with this issue It scares the hell out of me just getting up in the morning Seeking to show that the Administration was still able to make public policy three Cabinet officers were ushered into the White House briefing room Tuesday to promote Mr Reagans proposals for enhancing American competitiveness abroad They joined a parade of officials who have been talking about such topics as welfare reform and catastrophic health care a permanent ban on abortion financing and Star Wars Mr Reagans plan for spacebased missile defenses The President himself who had been inaccessible to reporters for weeks was pronounced fully recovered from his prostate operation Immediately stepping up his schedule he made his first speech outside the White House this year telling a convention of conservative activists that as an old actor he was saving the best stuff for the last act He also said he intends to start traveling around the country again talking up his legislative program But as the President tried to revive an Administration that seemed in dire need of a lifesupport system an array of forces were threatening to pull the plug The Iran arms deal and the subsequent diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels or contras simply refused to fade away From his hospital bed where he is being treated for clinical depression after recovering from what the police have said was a suicide attempt Robert C McFarlane the former national security advisor again spoke with the special review board headed by former Senator John Tower the Texas Republican Mr McFarlane said he had participated in an attempt last November to conceal the Presidents role in the affair but Marlin Fitzwater the White House spokesman said Mr Reagan was not aware of any coverup of his role Within the Administration contending forces seemed seriously divided over many policies as determined conservatives pushed for ideological purity while a more moderate faction argued that the Administration had to produce practical alternatives or risk becoming irrelevant to the decisionmaking process As an aide to House Republican leaders described the White House tactics They dont want to be standing on the sidelines saying no They want to be an active player Conservatives appeared to be getting their way on foreign policy and national security as the Administration propounded what was called a broad interpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union The interpretation would permit extensive testing and development of Mr Reagans Strategic Defense Initiative But the more moderate factions seemed to be dominating domestic policy particularly on the trade issue and the new catchword competitiveness Last year the Administration figured it could simply veto any trade measure Congress might pass But with the Democrats in control now the Administration is seeking cooperation with the Congress Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d said in presenting the trade package Its no secret that weve changed our strategy he added There was an election last year Regans Uncertain Future Accordingly the Administrations proposed legislation included close to 18 billion for retraining displaced workers and improving the job skills of lowincome youths And the President in explaining his proposals quoted the new Speaker of the House Jim Wright the Texas Democrat The Administrations ability to become an active player was undermined however by vacancies in several important White House jobs as well as by persistent efforts to depose Donald T Regan the chief of staff led by the Presidents wife Nancy and some of his closest friends The President stirred up new questions about his aides stayingpower when he said last week that Mr Regans future was up to him Also illustrating the frayed nerves in the White House were the stories from Administration officials and Reagan intimates that the chief of staff and the First Lady were feuding with each other and barely on speaking terms Administration supporters worried that with less than two years left in office Mr Reagan like some of his predecessors would have trouble attracting topflight talent to assist him Stuart K Spencer an old political ally of the President turned down a senior White House post Theres just a feeling that the thing is adrift over there said Senator David L Boren the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee No one is giving the President good advice on substance or politics Democratic leaders meanwhile were trying to strike a balance between confrontation and cooperation They sense the presence of a big vacuum in Washington as a Democratic aide put it and are eager to fill it with legislative activity that could serve them well in the 1988 election Questions for Gates Democrats say they also are looking ahead to the postReagan era and trying to block the President from implanting his ideas so firmly that they would be difficult for a potential Democratic President to uproot two years from now Perhaps the best example of this struggle is the fight over Star Wars which the Democrats want to restrict to the laboratory and some Republicans want to deploy as soon as possible At the same time many issues facing the country particularly the budget deficit appear to have no palatable solution and any party that takes the lead in trying to solve them runs a grave risk The real danger for us the Democratic aide added is to be saddled with total responsibility We need to keep the finger pointed at the White House Its up to them to lead We still want to be underdogs in 1988 What neither party can avoid these days is the seemingly endless flow of revelations in the Irancontra affair Last week Senator Borens committee raised the issue again as it examined the record of Robert M Gates the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence the Presidents nominee to succeed William J Casey as Director And the White House was besieged with questions about whether Mr Reagan had changed his account of the affair Throughout the capital all other subjects continued to take second place

"DAVID SUSSKIND, TALK-SHOW HOST, DIES AT 66",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/obituaries/david-susskind-talk-show-host-dies-at-66.html,David Susskind the television producer and one of the countrys earliest and bestknown television talkshow hosts was found dead apparently of natural causes yesterday afternoon in his hotel suite in midtown Manhattan He was 66 years old Although Mr Susskind had given up The David Susskind Show last September after nearly 30 years on the air he was still active and had produced four television specials in the last year Two of them on Winston Churchill and Dwight D Eisenhower were shown last year and the others on Lyndon B Johnson and Pope John XXIII are to be broadcast this year According to the police Mr Susskind had been under a doctors care for a heart ailment and had been scheduled to enter Lenox Hill Hospital today Unable to reach Mr Susskind by telephone yesterday a friend called his hotel the Wyndham at 42 West 58th Street about 120 PM and a maid and a security guard entered his suite and found him face up on the floor of the bedroom the police said A police spokesman Sgt Raymond ODonnell said Mr Susskinds body was examined by an assistant medical examiner who said that there was no evidence of foul play and that death was apparently from natural causes In a career that spanned more than 40 years and touched Hollywood Broadway and a nation of television viewers Mr Susskind was a press agent a talent scout an impresario and a producer of films plays and television programs ranging from classic drama and discussion shows to entertainment spectaculars He put five shows on Broadway including Rashomon in 1959 and made 13 films including Raisin in the Sun and Requiem for a Heavyweight in 1961 He also won many Emmy Awards and other honors for television productions which included Look Homeward Angel in 1972 and Eleanor and Franklin in 1976 But it was as the earnestly combative moderator of his own talk shows Open End a forum that sometimes ran for hours which began in 1958 and of its successor The David Susskind Show after 1967  that he became bestknown to American audiences Short silverhaired sincere with a mellifluous baritone voice that sometimes rambled in its painstaking search for the right words he interviewed thousands of guests over the years Presidents and paupers glittering stars and forgotten people advocates and opponents of all kinds of controversial issues Often he engaged up to a dozen guests at a time usually divided into two or more opposing camps and he strived with probing questions and sometimes nottoosubtle suggestions to accentuate differences and to illuminate areas of common ground The Issues of the Times His subjects seemed to chronicle the issues of the times  civil rights war abortion terrorism drugs crime exotic life styles  and his subjects were as wideranging as his guests who included Harry S Truman Nikita S Khrushchev Richard M Nixon Robert F Kennedy Vietnam veterans a skimasked professional killer and hosts of others Many in his audiences found him an appealing quiz master probing for telling details of his guests lives opinions and ideas undaunted by their rebukes or his own lack of detailed knowledge about subjects under discussion Others found his questions and comments naive narrow sophomoric or intrusive especially when interviewing intellectuals or other people of great stature and sometimes even when he was interviewing rather unextraordinary guests Talking with four Roman Catholic nuns for example he referred to them as good sisters noted that they were the first nuns he had ever met and said he liked to see nuns on airplanes and that he always admired their dedication He also said he thought all nuns were beautiful and did not show their age Much of the program was devoted to correcting his stereotypes Theres no truth to the rumor that David Susskind will be our next Secretary of State the columnist Hy Gardner said after Mr Susskind interviewed Khrushchev And Jack OBrian the critic observed after the encounter that Mr Susskind had gone unarmed into the battle of wits Admirers of Mr Susskind were quick to note though that he often raised stereotypes deliberately to have them knocked them down and that his views even if occsionally off the mark reflected widespread notions that at least gained exposure and were openly challenged on his program After an association of nearly three decades with Channel 5 in New York the former WNEWTV which is now WNYWTV Mr Susskind stopped producing the program last September because of its latenight time slot from 130 to 330 AM Sunday nights according to his daughter and fellow producer Diana Laptook David Howard Susskind was born in New York City on Dec 19 1920 the son of Benjamin and Frances Lear Susskind and was raised in Brookline Mass After two years at the University of Wisconsin where he married the former Phyllis Briskin in 1939 he enrolled in Harvard and graduated with honors in 1942 The Most Dynamic Field He served in the Navy saw action at Iwo Jima and Okinawa and was discharged in 1946 He then turned to show business the most dynamic and interesting field I could get into he recalled later After a time as a press agent he and Alfred Levy a talent agent formed Talent Associates Ltd The new agency packaged programs for the young television industry and represented writers directors and other creative personnel rather than actors The agency sold the Philco Television Playhouse and within a year the Music Corporation of America hired Mr Susskind as producer of the Philco program He quickly developed a skill and an enthusiasm for the craft and produced the Kaiser Aluminum Hour the Armstrong Circle Theater and others He then expanded his production efforts to Hollywood and Broadway His Broadway stage offerings included A Very Special Baby 1956 Kelly1965 All in Good Time 1965 and Brief Lives1967 His films included Edge of the City 1957 All the Way Home 1963 Lovers and Other Strangers 1969 Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore 1974 Loving Couples 1980 Fort Apache The Bronx 1981 His television plays included The Bridge of San Luis Rey The Glass Menagerie 1973 Caesar and Cleopatra 1976 Truman at Potsdam 1976 In the late 1950s he was producing more live shows than the three television networks combined Behind the credits was a harddriving man with closecropped wavy hair a boyish smile and an irrepressible selfconfidence Despite his television success he was one of the mediums most outspoken critics But his critics accused him of deploring mediocrity while offering nothing better and of presenting safe wellestablished successes rather than untried original scripts In 1958 Mr Susskind launched Open End a latenight New York City talk show without set time limits The host and his guests simply talked until the subject  and the viewer some critics said  was exhausted In 1967 the openended format gave way to its twohour successor The David Susskind Show Other talk shows veered to entertainment but his kept the emphasis on serious matters and it succeeded eventually reaching more than a million viewers through 100 stations Colleagues said he loved the clash of ideas the effort to come to grips with issues crises and human problems and they praised his ability to attract outstanding guests and to draw them out Over the years his views on television evolved Ive grown up he said in a 1978 interview after 20 years as host of his own show I once idealized television he said I thought television could be much more of an illuminating beacon  informing instructing educating taking the public by the hand and leading it But American television was never that I was a younger and more idealistic David Susskind I am not a cynic today I am simply pragmatic Mr Susskinds marriage to Phyllis Briskin ended in divorce many years ago He married the former Joyce Davidson in 1966 they were divorced last year Mr Susskind is survived by a son Andrew of Los Angeles three daughters Diana Laptook of Fort Lee NJ and Pamela Schaenen and Samantha Susskind of New York City a sister Dorothy

COURTS DEBATE JUDGES' ROLE WHEN GIRLS SEEK ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/us/courts-debate-judges-role-when-girls-seek-abortions.html,She was 14 when she became pregnant She told her mother and her mother called the clinic to set up an abortion That was where the law came in about the same time as the morning sickness A bundle of nausea anger and fear she went to the same state court that handles juvenile delinquents with braces on her teeth and a fullness in her womb After being interviewed by several officials and waiting in the hall recalled Amanda a pseudonym she chose for an interview this week you go back to the judges chambers and you sit in there with some lady whos typing and your courtappointed attorney and your guardian and the judge asks you why you want an abortion None of His Business And that to me she said voice rising in highpitched indignation is none of his business Why I want an abortion and what I want to do with my life and my body is not up to him But under a 1981 Minnesota law it was up to the judge to clear the abortion as long as Amanda was unwilling to tell her father She remembered him as an alcoholic who had beaten her mother before he moved out long ago He had taken no interest in her and she wanted nothing to do with him The law required girls under 18 to tell both parents of their plans 48 hours before having an abortion or to ask a state judge to waive the notification It was held unconstitutional by a Federal district judge in November First to Weigh How It Works The Supreme Court which has handed down six decisions on the extent to which minors access to abortion can be restricted will hear arguments in April on the constitutionality of a 24hour waiting period in an Illinois law somewhat similar to Minnesotas But in the Illinois case as in the past the Justices will not have any evidence to weigh concerning the actual operation of the law which was struck down before it took effect The Minnesota ruling which is now before a Federal appeals court is of particular interest because Federal District Judge Donald D Alsops 59page decision striking it down was the first examination by any court of how a notification law has worked in practice After hearing testimony by teenagers mothers abortion providers juvenile court judges psychologists and others he found that the law had burdened minors seeking abortions without serving in any meaningful way its goal of providing those who were immature with parental support and guidance 20 States Have Passed Laws At a time when one in every four teenage girls will become pregnant before reaching 18 the issues raised by parental notification and consent laws touch millions of families Twenty states have laws seeking to encourage minors to tell their parents or obtain their consent before having abortions but about half are not now being enforced because of court orders Similar proposals are or soon will be pending before many other state legislatures including New Yorks New York like New Jersey and Connecticut currently has no such requirement Judge Alsop struck at the heart of such proposals when without disputing that teenagers could benefit from parental guidance he suggested that the evidence in Minnesota contradicted the Supreme Courts assumption that legislation could in fact foster such parentchild consultation That assumption has been a critical element in the Courts past decisions on minors access to abortions While the precise issue before the Supreme Court in the Illinois case is narrow involving a 24hour waiting period for minors who choose to tell their parents the Courts ruling could clear up some of the confusion left by its previous decisions Those rulings have created a complex set of rules leaving groups on both sides of the abortion issue unhappy especialy antiabortion groups and some parents who are outraged at the notion that a judge could authorize a 14yearold girl to have an abortion without even telling her parents Parents Cant Have Final Say The Justices have struck down laws that gave parents an absolute veto over their daughters decisions saying that a prompt and confidential judicial procedure to bypass parents must be available both for minors deemed mature enough to make their own decisions and for immature minors whose best interests would be served by having abortions without parental consent But in upholding state requirements that minors submit to such a court procedure the majority has reasoned that immature minors could benefit from governmental encouragement to consult their parents Judge Alsop however said the evidence indicated the Minnesota law did not in practice spur many teenagers to consult their parents Those who had reason to hope their parents would be supportive would have consulted them without such a law he found He said Minnesotas requirement that both parents be notified was actually counterproductive because it forced pregnant teenagers who had confided in one parent to go to court anyway in an era when about half of all marriages end in divorce and some girls fear their fathers would react violently if told of their pregnancies The evidence showed that it was easy enough once in court to persuade a judge to waive parental notification Minnesota judges approved Amandas request and more than 3500 others between 1981 and 1986 while turning down only 9  onequarter of 1 percent But Judge Alsop found that requiring teenagers to go to court at all often for the first time in their lives deterred some from going through with their abortion plans and inflicted needless trauma on thousands of others at a time of great emotional stress Risk Seen in Delays Some teenagers had to travel long distances to go to court he said causing delays in the abortion procedure that increased health risks Similar delays were caused by the 48hour waiting period for those who chose to notify their parents There was also the fear of being seen at the courthouse by someone they knew especially in small towns According to Tina Welsh the head of a clinic that provides abortions in Duluth one pregnant teenager was horrified when the court reporter turned out to be her nextdoor neighbor While stating that Supreme Court precedent might have required him to uphold the Minnesota law if it had been more narrowly drawn Judge Alsop struck down the entire statute on the ground that it was too burdensome to require minors who do not want to go to court to notify not just one but both parents and to wait 48 hours afterwards And he suggested in his review of the evidence that any notification law would do more harm than good Supporters of the Minnesota law which the Legislature adopted in 1981 by votes of 109 to 19 in the House and 49 to 16 in the Senate strongly disagree Jackie Schwietz coexecutive director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life an antiabortion group that drafted the law said I dont think Judge Alsop knows how many daughters went home and told their parents just because they knew the law was there We know there were quite a few of them and I think the law did promote parental involvement in that sense Saved From Hasty Decisions To the extent that the law deterred some minors from having abortions she suggested it served a useful purpose by saving the lives of unborn children It also saved pregnant teenagers from hastily and with little counseling going through with an act of profound moral significance that might later bring feelings of guilt and regret Mrs Schwietz said In any event Mrs Schwietz added it was not that difficult to go through the judicial bypass procedure To the contrary it was far too easy Many parents were outraged and frustrated and sad to learn that judges had rubberstamped their daughters plans to have abortions without telling them Mrs Schwietz said that while her group opposed all abortions the notification laws backers included some supporters of abortion rights who felt it was extremely important that parents at least be notified before their minor daughter makes a decision that may affect her life forever Attorney General Hubert H Humphrey 3d of Minnesota said in a brief defending the law in Decemeber that the Constitution protected not only the rights of women to have abortions but also the right of parents to raise their minor children and participate in the conduct of their lives In interviews arranged by the abortion clinic in Duluth last week five teenagers said they had had abortions because they feared that unwed motherhood would have ended their plans to go to college or to have careers plunged them into dependency and caused friends and neighbors to shun them They said that the boyfriends who had impregnated them would not take responsibility or pay child support and that if they had carried their pregnancies to term they could not have brought themselves to give their babies up for adoption Parents Were Wrecks Already Four of these teenagers gave varying reasons for going to court rather than telling both parents One said she had planned to tell both parents but then her father had been arrested for driving while drunk and lost his job I decided there was no way I could do that to them then she recalled My mom and my dad were both wrecks already Another said her older sister had become an unwed mother because her parents had prevented her from having an abortion A third said her parents would have had a fit if they had learned of her pregnancy A fourth like Amanda had confided in her mother but wanted nothing to do with her longabsent father A fifth girl said she had told her father she was pregnant I wanted him to put his arms around me and say Well work it out  she recalled Instead he kicked her out of the house She moved in with her stepmother who was separated from her father and got an abortion Later her father accused her of killing my grandchild The stepmother helped pay for the 200 abortion despite strong misgivings Ive worked at the hospital she said in a separate interview and Ive seen what they scrape out after a miscarriage I believe they have a little heart and a little soul from the moment of conception So I could never do it But I dont pass judgment on those who do Theres so many sides to this I see so many young girls who shouldnt be pregnant who shouldnt have babies And once they have a baby theyre not going to be able to give it up for adoption That goes against our nature Feelings of Guilt and Depression The deep divisions in American society over the fundamental morality of abortion cast a long shadow over the debate on parental notification and consent laws In the pending Supreme Court case three women who joined a legal brief filed as a friend of the court by a group called American Victims of Abortion said they had been racked by feelings of guilt and depression since having abortions as teenagers One said these feelings had intensified when she saw photographs of 10weekold fetuses and learned more about the development of a fetus during pregnancy Urging the Court to uphold the Illinois laws 24hour waiting period after parental notification these women said that if they had been required to tell their parents they might have been saved from doing something they now profoundly regret The American Psychological Association on the other hand filed a brief arguing that most adolescents who have abortions feel relief not guilt and that when women experience regret depression or guilt such feelings are mild and diminish rapidly in most cases Some of the Minnesota teenagers interviewed last week expressed some ambivalence about having had abortions But none said they regretted what they had done I still think about it you know said Amanda who is now 16 Its not like it doesnt faze you I mean you dont want to kill something But I wanted to go on in school and have a career and what I did was right for me

SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES TAKE CASE ON DISPLAY OF EXPLICIT MATERIALS TO YOUTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-take-case-display-explicit-materials-youth.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether states may ban stores from displaying sexually explicit materials deemed harmful to juveniles in places where children might be able to examine them The case is an appeal by Virginia officials of a lower Federal court decision striking down a 1985 Virginia law that restricted display of sexually explicit materials that could legally be sold to adults but not to juveniles Federal district and appellate courts ruled that the law violated booksellers rights of free speech under the First Amendment The level of discourse reaching commercial bookshelves cannot be limited to what might be appropriate for an elementary school library the Federal District Court said 48 States May Be Affected The outcome of the case in the Supreme Court could affect laws in 48 other states including New York New Jersey and Connecticut that regulate in some fashion the display or exhibition to minors of harmful materials according to a brief in which 20 states joined including New Jersey and Connecticut as friends of the court supporting Virginias appeal Many cities also have such laws The Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the legal definition of obscenity a category of speech it has held unprotected by the First Amendment could be broader for material sold to juveniles than for material sold to adults It held under this variable obscenity doctrine that states could ban sale to juveniles of some sexually explicit materials while sale to adults would be protected by the First Amendment The issue in this case Virginia v American Booksellers Association No 861034 is whether the constitutional rights of bookstores to display sexually explicit materials that are not obscene for adults override the powers of the states to prevent the display of those same materials where juveniles might see them Lower courts have reached conflicting results in assessing the constitutionality of various restrictions on display of materials deemed obscene for minors Materials Harmful to Juveniles The Virginia law now before the Supreme Court was a 1985 amendment to an older Virginia statute that bars the sale to juveniles of materials deemed harmful to juveniles The older law defines material harmful to juveniles in accordance with Supreme Court precedents as including the description or representation of nudity or sexual conduct that predominantly appeals to the prurient shameful or morbid interest of juveniles and is patently offensive to adult community standards with respect to what is suitable material for juveniles and is when taken as a whole lacking in serious literary artistic political or scientific value for juveniles The constitutionality of the states ban on sale of such materials to juveniles was not challenged in the case Lawyers for the state told the appellate court that for example Hollywood Wives by Jackie Collins a national best seller for more than six months in 1983 and 1984 might be deemed obscene for juveniles It might thus be a crime under the old Virginia law knowingly to sell that book to a juvenile Under the 1985 amendment it might be a crime knowingly to display the book where a juvenile might examine it In a suit by groups of booksellers publishers and other plaintiffs a Federal District Court in Alexandria Va held that while the intent of the Virginia law was to prevent minors from examining certain materials the unavoidable collateral effect of the law is to severely limit the ability of adults to examine these protected materials Limits Sales to Adults This in turn severely limits sales to adults since the evidence establishes that adults generally become acquainted with these materials and desire to purchase them only if they are readily visible the district court said The state said in its appeal brief that the goal of protecting minors from harmful materials would be frustrated if such materials could be displayed without restriction It said booksellers could comply with the 1985 amendment and still sell the same materials to adults by such steps as creating a separate adultsonly section or adultsonly shelves keeping the materials sealed or taking them off display and keeping them under the counter Execution and Youth The Justices also agreed to consider whether states may execute convicted murderers who were under 18 years old when they committed their crimes About 35 of the more than 1800 people on death rows around the country were condemned for murders committed before they reached the age of 18 according to death penalty opponents as were 3 of the 69 persons who have been executed in the United States since 1977 two in Texas and one in South Carolina The pending case Thompson v Oklahoma No 866169 is an appeal by William Wayne Thompson an Oklahoma death row inmate who was the youngest of four defendants sentenced to death for the murder of Charles Keene in January 1983 when Mr Thompson was 15 Mr Keene was the former husband of Mr Thompsons sister In his appeal Mr Thompson now 19 argued that execution of a person for a crime committed as a minor would violate the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment He also argued that the trial judge had denied him a fair sentencing hearing and inflamed the jury against him by allowing the jury to see two ghastly color photographs of the murder victims body after it had been in a river almost a month Mr Keene was abducted beaten and shot twice and his throat chest and abdomen had been cut A witness said he heard one of the killers tell Mr Keene this is for the way you treated our sister Mr Thompsons older brother was one of the defendants The Court will hear arguments next fall in these cases and 14 others that it agreed to review today on returning from a fourweek recess It is expected to decide them by July 1988 Damage Suit Over Wounded Knee In another case the Court will hear arguments by the Government for dismissing before trial a 12yearold damage suit by 14 Sioux against 12 former Federal and military officials including Alexander M Haig the former White House chief of staff stemming from the armed confrontation between Federal agents and Indians at Wounded Knee SD in 1973 A Federal appeals court cleared the way last year for a trial on allegations by the plaintiffs that the Governments use of soldiers to seal off their village on the Pine Ridge Reservation for 10 weeks violated their rights under the Constitution as well as the 19thcentury Posse Comitatus Act which restricts use of the military for domestic law enforcement Solicitor General Charles Fried said in his appeal Haig v Bissonette No 86987 that the appeals court erred in ruling that the alleged violation of the Posse Comitatus Act would automatically establish a violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights The Court also dealt with these matters today PROTESTS AT EMBASSIES The Court will decide the constitutionality of a District of Columbia law allowing the police to prohibit hostile placards and demonstrations within 500 feet of any foreign embassy in an appeal by four conservatives who wanted to carry placards criticizing the Soviet and Nicaraguan Governments in front of their embassies Boos v Barry No 86803 SEX DISCRIMINATION It will consider in an Illinois case whether a judge found by a jury to have dismissed a court employee because of her sex was absolutely immune from liability for sex discrimination under Federal civil rights laws Forrester v White No 86761 HANDICAPPED CHILDREN The Justices will consider in a California case the extent to which the Federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1982 limits the power of public school officials to expel or suspend emotionally handicapped children for disruptive behavior such as assaulting other students Honig v Doe No 86728 SEATBELT CHALLENGE The Court dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question a challenge to an Illinois law requiring all frontseat occupants of motor vehicles to wear seatbelts Todays action indicated somewhat ambiguously that the Court generally agreed with the Illinois Supreme Courts ruling that such laws do not violate privacy rights protected by the Constitution Kohrig v Illinois No 861095 ABORTION RIGHTS The Court also declined a request by abortion rights advocates urging it to hear on an extraordinary expedited basis a case now pending in a Federal appellate court involving the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that requires minors seeking abortions to notify both parents or get a state judge to waive the notification requirement Hodgson v Minnesota No 86882 COURTROOM PROPRIETY And it refused to hear an appeal by seven people who were held in contempt of court and sentenced to 30 days in jail for refusing on religious grounds to stand when a Texas municipal judge entered his courtroom Only Justice Thurgood Marshall voted to hear the appeal Krupps v Texas No 86589
GEPHARDT OPENS CAMPAIGN FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/us/gephardt-opens-campaign-for-democratic-nomination.html,Calling for an end to an era of selfishness and stern measures on trade to make America first Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri today became the first major Democrat to announce his candidacy for President In an address in his hometown that resonated with ideas drawn from John F Kennedys oratory the 46yearold Congressman first elected in 1976 declared that the Reagan Administration had failed the nation by refusing to challenge it to a higher standard Instead of asking something of us they have given us a call to selfishness he said They have not summoned us to think about the future but only to think about ourselves Ronald Reagan made us feel good said Mr Gephardt whose earnest and methodical ambition has taken him from city alderman to candidate for President in just 11 years Now America must ask What will it take for us to be good How can we do better How can we be the best Altar of False Ideology Sounding what is expected to be a central theme of his underdog campaign Mr Gephardt said that the livelihoods of American workers should not be sacrificed on the altar of a false and rigid freetrade ideology and that the United States cannot live in a global marketplace in which Americans are free to buy but not to sell The next President he said must be as tough in negotiating the terms of trade as this President has been in negotiating with the Russians Mr Gephardt has drawn but 1 to 2 percent in the national opinion polls but he has earned credibility among political professionals by the sheer doggedness of his pursuit of the 1988 nomination We will do it by being the first to work each day and the last to quit each night he said We will do it because we know that what matters is not who runs in front but who finishes in front He has campaigned especially hard in Iowa the scene of the first Presidential caucuses and the place where he knows he must do well if he is to have a chance at nomination 41 Days in Iowa After his address here he flew to Des Moines his 25th trip to Iowa and his 41st campaign day there since January 1985 In the 1986 midterm elections he campaigned in Iowa for Democratic candidates for offices ranging from United States Senator to county commissioner He told an airport crowd drawing a laugh of his acute awareness of this states importance to the Presidential nominating process A top Iowa Democratic strategist interviewed at Mr Gephardts Des Moines rally said that only three of the potential Democratic contenders were highly organized and visible in the state Mr Gephardt former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona Mr Gephardt told reporters on the plane back to St Louis that the trade issue marked a key difference between him and Mr Hart who holds a large lead in national polls Mr Gephardt described Mr Hart as less willing to actually threaten and even go ahead and partially close our markets to countries that have a pattern of unfair trade practices against us Although Walter F Mondale came under sharp attack for taking a protectionist position in 1984 Mr Gephardt said the issue was seen differently now The facts have changed Mr Gephardt said Mondale was talking about an issue that was about to happen Now its happened Mr Gephardt chairman of the Democratic caucus has been resolutely centrist in his Congresional career building a reputation as a negotiator and conciliator He has been unusually sensitive to emerging political issues joning Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey as an early cosponsor of a tax overhaul bill that formed a basis for last years new tax law Duty on Imports He began speaking of the importance of competitiveness and the nations trade imbalance before they became central political issues He is the sponsor of a bill that would establish a 10 percent duty on goods from nations that restrict access to their markets As currently written the bill would apply to goods from Japan South Korea Taiwan and Brazil And in a move expected to win him favor among some Iowa farmers he is the coauthor with the states Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of a bill to limit crop production as a way of saving family farms Mr Gephardts ability to sense the direction of the political winds has sometimes subjected him to criticism He has already been attacked for changing his stand on abortion Initially a sponsor of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion he withdrew his support saying that the measure had no chance of passage But he still opposes Federal financing of abortions When he returned to St Louis Mr Gephart was greeted by a dozen antiabortion pickets one of whom carried a sign reading A man is as good as his word 40 Colleagues Help Mr Gephardts skills at conciliation and his reputation for oldfashioned open friendliness has won him support in the form of either formal endorsement or help on fundraising from 40 of his House colleagues about half of whom came to hear his announcement today These included the House majority leader Thomas S Foley of Washington and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Both Mr Foley and Mr Rostenkowski addressed the crowd at the refurbished Union Station here  the place Mr Gephardt noted where another Missouri native son Harry S Truman accepted victory in the 1948 Presidential election A lawyer who started in ward politics in Missouri became an alderman in 1971 and was elected to Congress five years later Mr Gephardt has what colleagues have called an air of unmitigated wholesomeness about him He and his wife Jane have three children  Matthew 16 Christine 13 and Katherine 9  and the family presented a striking tableau before the crowds and television cameras this morning You know what Dick Gephardts weakness is said Representative Dave McCurdy an Oklahoma Democrat who was one of those supporters here today joking about the Dick and Jane Presidential couple His dogs not named Spot
"A DAY AFTER CARDINAL'S APPEAL, BOMBING SUSPECT SURRENDERS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/25/nyregion/a-day-after-cardinal-s-appeal-bombing-suspect-surrenders.html,A man wanted in the bombings of several New York City abortion clinics surrendered quietly to Federal agents in lower Manhattan yesterday less than 24 hours after John Cardinal OConnor delivered a televised plea for him to turn himself in The suspect Dennis J Malvasi a 37yearold fireworks expert walked into the lobby of 90 Church Street where the Bureau of Alcohol Tobbaco and Firearms has its offices wearing an eye patch and sunglasses shortly after 2 PM the authorities said Mr Malvasi described by the authorities as a Roman Catholic and an antiabortion zealot told the agents who arrested him that he had come as a direct result of the Cardinals appeal according to Patrick D Hynes the assistant head of the bureaus New York office He said Its hard to turn down the Cardinal Mr Hynes said He said Mr Malvasi who is a suspect in four bombings or attempted bombings in New York since October had then asked for a lawyer and made no further statements The authorities said they had no evidence linking Mr Malvasi to other attacks Hours before his surrender the fugitive had telephoned an aide to the Cardinal the Archbishop of New York to say he was giving himself up He called about 11 AM and said hed seen the Cardinal on TV and hed like me to let the Cardinal know that hed be coming in within two to three hours if not sooner said the aide Monsignor Peter Finn And sure enough he did The Cardinal in an interview broadcast on WNBCTV newscasts Monday night urged Mr Malvasi a licensed fireworks technician who worked on last years Statue of Liberty celebration to surrender He called the bombings of the clinics completely contradictory to the fundamental teachings of our Catholic faith A spokesman Joseph Zwilling said last night that the Cardinal was pleased that Mr Malvasi has come in and that he was able to play some small part in it The WNBC reporter who broadcast the Cardinals appeal John Miller said the Cardinal had agreed to make it after a friend of Mr Malvasi told Mr Miller that he was sure a plea from the Archbishop would cause the suspect to surrender Last week the police and Federal authorities idenitified Mr Malvasi a sometime actor who has entertained on cruise ships as the prime suspect in a series of recent bombings and attempting bombings in New York He has been charged with setting a dynamite bomb that caused extensive structural damage to the Eastern Womens Center at 38 East 30th Street in Manhattan last Oct 29 and with placing a bomb that failed to detonate fully at the Margaret Sanger Pavilion of Planned Parenthood at 380 Second Avenue in Manhattan on Dec 14 Mr Malvasi who entered no plea at his arraignment in Federal District Court in Manhattan last night is to have a bail hearing on Monday The authorities said he was also a suspect in the attempted bombing of the Queens Womens Medical Office at 8306 Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst on Nov 11 and the bombing of the Manhattan Womens Center at 115 East 23d Street on Dec 10 Rudolph W Giuliani the United States Attorney in Manhattan who announced the arrest at a news conference in his office said several other suspects were still being sought in connection with the incidents But he said Mr Malvasi was believed to be the one who did the bombings Mr Giuliani and Mr Hynes said they had no indication that Mr Malvasi was part of any organized group of people responsible for other bombings elsewhere In recent years there have been a series of unsolved bombings of abortion clinics around the country
WASHINGTON; On the Road to '88,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/25/opinion/washington-on-the-road-to-88.html,The 1988 Presidential bandwagons are rolling along into the future without taking time to fill in the potholes or examine the wrong way signs of the past This is the first of a series of columns on the long road ahead starting with a few random thoughts about the people who are running and a few others who maybe should be running To begin its interesting to note that theres a difference between running for President and governing the nation And theres also a difference between public opinion and what may be called informed opinion about the candidates for the job Public opinion polls tend to measure personality and focus on familiar names and faces but informed opinion  that is to say the private judgment of those men and women who know more about the candidates  tends to measure experience and character If for example you could take a private poll here today among informed people about who is best qualified to be President the private and public polls would not be the same This is not a challenge to the democratic principle that the people know best but merely a suggestion that they dont always get the best people to choose from The Founding Fathers put more trust in informed opinion than in public opinion Most of the early Presidents  and they were some bunch didnt seek office but were drafted usually with a shove from the insiders who knew them best For example the first six Presidents skipping General Washington had served as Secretary of State or ambassador abroad or both before getting to the top But nobody has even mentioned George Shultz who has served at State Treasury and Labor except of course Jack Kemp who wants to kick him out of town Nobody mentions Paul Volcker either the big guy at the Federal Reserve Bank with the big cigar Considering that he helped save whats left of the economy and that were facing even more problems at home and abroad its odd that he hasnt even been given a medium hello Then there are the Bakers Probably no man has won or deserved the respect of leaders of the legislative and executive branches of the Government in recent years more than Howard Baker of Tennessee the former Republican leader of the Senate And no member of the Reagan Cabinet stands higher with the insiders than James Baker of Texas the Secretary of the Treasury and former White House chief of staff These are serious men who know that the remedy for what now troubles the nation does not lie in constitutional amendments to wipe out the deficit or abortion or in dramatic nuclear shields in outer space but first and foremost in the restoration of trust which is the foundation of democratic government They are not trying to produce peace and prosperity all at once with flashy schemes and foolproof ideologies They are the builders of coalitions within and between the parties and the free nations who know that the security of the nation and the defense of a civilization depend on more than guns and propaganda And they are not alone Looking at the men who have run and won or lost the Presidency in the last generation it can scarcely be said that they tower above those who are now available or might be available in the Presidential campaign of 1988 A new generation is now coming to the fore for example Gary Hart Joe Biden Bill Bradley Albert Gore and Sam Nunn in the Senate Mr Nunn didnt say no but maybe Richard Gephardt and a sleeper Tom Foley of Washington the majority leader of the House and young governors or former governors like Mike Dukakis of Massachusetts and Charles Robb of Virginia  not forgetting George Bush a good man trapped in a bad job For the moment Washington is becalmed and bewildered trapped beteen the monarchy of the last six years and some sort of regency that will have to mind the store for the next two But the present mood will pass as new men and issues arise Even Mario Cuomo the Governor of New York may change his mind He said he wouldnt run for President but he didnt say he wouldnt take it What he did say was that he didnt have fire in his belly and didnt want to drag his family through all those chicken dinners and interviews with nosy reporters But who does What we are looking for however is not candidates with fire in their bellies but with brains in their domes not for Presidents who stand tall in the saddle and are inclined to lose their balance We tried that before and it didnt work
NEED TO WIDEN AIDS TESTING SEEN AS HEALTH FORUM ENDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/26/us/need-to-widen-aids-testing-seen-as-health-forum-ends.html,Participants in a federally sponsored conference on the control of AIDS reached broad agreement today on the need for wider testing for infection with the AIDS virus provided it was voluntary and accompanied by adequate counseling and safeguards to keep results confidential In closing the unusual twoday public forum sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control health officials from around the nation called for a more systematic offering of the blood test to detect infection with the virus that causes the fatal disease of the immune system They proposed that the test should be offered on a voluntary basis to groups at special risk such as people being treated for sexually transmitted diseases those being treated for intravenous drug use and their sexual partners and in some circumstances pregnant women Such testing should also be specifically provided in areas where there is a high prevalence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome the participants said They also urged health officials to do more pilot studies to determine the most effective way of gaining the confidence of people at highest risk so that they will volunteer for the test Proposed Steps Are Debated Participants in the meeting which included state and local health officials and advocates of civil liberties debated a range of proposals for wider use of the test They included suggestions that all applicants for marriage licenses and all patients entering hospitals might be tested in order to protect newborns and to determine the extent of AIDS virus infection in the population But in the discussions there appeared to be near unanimous feeling against mandatory or compulsory testing of any group for AIDS The Centers for Disease Control here the main Federal agency charged with tracking the spread of epidemics called the meeting to explore the value of expanded uses of the AIDS blood test in monitoring and curbing the spread of the virus which they estimated already infects 15 million Americans The meeting did not adopt formal recommendations but the leaders of panel discussions will submit formal summarizies of their talks to Dr James O Mason director of the Centers for Disease Control Dr Mason said that after further discussion with state health officials he would decide whether to submit recommendations for changes in Federal policy to the Reagan Administration The participants said wider testing for AIDS would require more Government financing to provide the medical psychological and social counseling needed for those who are found to be infected and to inform infected women of the risks of becoming pregnant Threat to Newborns AIDS is believed to be especially dangerous in pregnancy which alters the immune system and is often transmitted to newborns Infected women should be advised about contraception and infected pregnant women should be offered the option of abortion many participants said Identifying AIDSinfected women through family planning and prenatal clinics is a higher priority than making the AIDS test a routine part of the marriage application participants stressed  AIDS is caused by a virus that cripples the immune system leaving patients vulnerable to infections and cancers Of the 31036 cases of AIDS reported as of Feb 23 443 were in children and 352 were born to a parent who was at risk of AIDS By 1991 Federal officials estimate more than 50000 Americans will die of AIDS each year More than four out of five AIDS cases in the United States so far have involved homosexual or bisexual men or intravenous drug users Scientists do not know what portion of infected people will develop the disease but presume that all infected people are carriers of the virus capable of spreading it to others through sexual intercourse exchanges of blood or from mothers to newborns The AIDS blood test detects evidence of antibodies the substances the body forms in response to invasion by the AIDS virus The blood test does not detect the AIDS virus itself Issue of Confidentiality William J Curran of Harvard a leading authority on public health law who led one panel said his group identified a need for the Federal Government to develop stronger protection of confidentiality in the many AIDS programs it supported The Government should punish anyone who breaches such confidentiality Mr Curran said Mr Curran stressed the need to reexamine state laws concerning sexually transmitted diseases because many were written in the 1920s and 1930s and thus might not be up to the task of protecting against AIDS a disease that was first recognized in 1981 Some laws do not provide adequate protection of due process and confidentiality and their powers are often very broad and discretionary Mr Curran said A need exists to spell out what can and cannot be done within the limits of confidentiality he said and clarification is needed of when and where data collected by public health workers can be shared Mr Curran urged public health officials to take the lead in pressing for confidentiality legislation to increase public confidence in its work He said particular attention was needed in the area of enacting laws to protect people infected with AIDS against discriminatory practices that often cost them their jobs housing and access to hotels restaurants and other public places Dr Robert J Levine of Yale another panel leader said violations of patient confidentiality often occurred in hospitals and to a lesser extent medical offices and clinics and that many such breaches were inadvertent He cited one example in which a clerk sent a copy of a bill for an AIDS blood test to an insurance company One of the most serious concerns of people contemplating AIDS tests is that insurance companies often deny them coverage if they learn that they are infected Sensitivity Is Urged Dr Jeffrey P Davis of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services said his panel stressed the need for health workers to be sensitive to cultural differences in counseling members of minority groups since there was a disproportionately high incidence of AIDS among blacks and people of Hispanic descent Counselors have the capacity to motivate or discourage people from being tested and then returning for the results Dr Davis said Dr Davis said there was a need for more pilot studies to determine the most effective ways to offer counseling and testing for women of childbearing age before they became pregnant Participants disagreed in the definitions of mandatory and routine testing and there was other confusion over the terminology used throughout the meeting For example Dr Bennie Prim executive director of the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation in Brooklyn said in summarizing his panels views that women of childbearing age who were dependent on drugs should be encouraged and required if necessary to have the AIDS virus test Dr Walter R Dowdle the acting deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control who moderated the closing session asked for clarification Dr Prims coleader Dr Franklyn N Judson of the Denver Department of Health and Hospitals said the panel was not even considering the issue of mandatory testing Dr Judson said his panel emphasized a more aggressive approach in routinely offering counseling and testing but that it did not fully discuss the question of what constituted informed consent in such cases Dr Levine of Yale noted that many participants used the terms routine anonymous standard required and confidential in many different ways with respect to AIDS testing He cited the use of the word routine

THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS; Choice of Baker Welcomed in Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/28/world/the-white-house-crisis-choice-of-baker-welcomed-in-congress.html,Republican and Democratic leaders today praised the appointment of the former Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr as President Reagans new chief of staff There was talk of Mr Bakers instant credibility and some leaders said his ability to work with Congress would be an important element in the Presidents chances to press for his agenda in the last two years in office But the same leaders also said that this was just a good first step and that the President still had more to do before rebounding from the scandal created by the secret arms deals with Iran Some leaders also wondered whether Mr Baker who is not as conservative as the President would have some difficulty in pushing the Presidents policies especially on arms control and some social issues like abortion A Great Pick The President has made a great pick said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader in the Senate Howard Baker is the right man at the right time at this critical period for the White House But Mr Dole said I dont think this means everything is suddenly coming up roses Senator Alan Cranston a California Democrat who is the secondranking leader in the Senate said the appointment will certainly improve relations between the White House and Congress and Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill But he said This is only the first step Better Chance for Arms Control He said to help the White House rebound Mr Baker will have to insist that there are policies that are carefully thought out Mr Cranston said the Administration as of now has no coherent arms control policy but said with Mr Baker as chief of staff I think there is better chance for arms control Mr Cranston also said that Mr Baker who was a Republican senator from Tennesse for 18 years will have to move to get out more of the facts on the Iran arms deals and the diversion of funds to the rebels in Nicaragua Senator Jim Sasser Democrat of Tennesse said Mr Baker will be the prime minister in the Reagan Administration He said that his strength in the Senate dealing with the large policy issues in a pragmatic way would help the White House Mr Baker himself moved quickly to dispel any thoughts that he would clash with the President over policy At a news conference he said I will try to go forward with his programs as best as I know how To Serve the President I do not expect any conflict he added I am there to serve the President While Senate majority leader from 1981 to 1984 Mr Baker did push many of the Presidents programs even when he disagreed But he notably did not work to get the Presidents social agenda including a ban on abortions to the Senate floor Senator Steve Symms a conservative Republican from Idaho said he was not worried about Mr Bakers policy differences with the President or himself I think Senator Baker in taking this job will be working for Ronald Reagan in carrying the Presidents point of view Several senators did note that the choice of Mr Baker will help the Presidential chances of Mr Dole who political experts say has already been helped because the Iran scandal is thought to have hurt the Presidential prospects of Vice President Bush Mr Baker said today he would not be a candidate in 1988 Still People Out There When asked about the political benefits from the scandal Mr Dole said there are still people out there and jokingly suggested that perhaps Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York another contender could become football commissioner Mr Dole noted that many of Mr Bakers supporters in New Hampshire said they would move to back Mr Dole if Mr Baker withdrew But he said I dont know if it makes any difference Mr Dole said that the chief failing of Donald T Regan the outgoing chief of staff was a lack of roughandtumble political experience Senator Alan K Simpson Republican of Wyoming said that the President meeting this morning with Republican leaders indicated that he was looking at the pragmatists rather then the purists in his choice for a new chief of staff And Mr Dole said this afternoon that he detected the fine hand of Paul Laxalt in the choice of Mr Baker Mr Laxalt a former Republican Senator from Nevada is a close friend of the President and was said to have been considered for the job Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts called the Baker selection an inspired choice and added it would have taken Howard Baker about one second to veto the arms deal with Iran Representative William H Gray 3rd Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House Budget Committee praised the choice and added that hoped Mr Bakers practical experience in the Senate will enable him to convince the President of the necessity of sitting down with members of Congress to come up with a resonable budget To this point the White House has rejected calls for highlevel negotiations on the budget because the President opposes tax increases which many in Congress feel are necessary
Helms and Carolina Governor Clash on Party Job,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/us/helms-and-carolina-governor-clash-on-party-job.html,Senator Jesse Helms and Gov James G Martin have taken opposing sides in a contest that will determine control of the North Carolina Republican machinery in the selection of the partys 1988 Presidential nominee The two Republicans have endorsed different candidates for state party chairman in a continuation of a struggle waged for more than a decade by the two principal factions of the state party The new party chairman who will be elected at the state Republican convention in May will serve while North Carolina conducts its Presidential primary and Republicans subsequently choose delegates to the partys national convention The North Carolina primary is scheduled for March 8 1988 along with at least a dozen other states most of them in the South and Border areas The primary results determine how the states votes for the Presidential nomination will be apportioned at the national convention But the state party chairman will have a role in choosing the delegates Helms Favors Professor Mr Helms has endorsed C Barry McCarty a 32yearold professor at Roanoke Bible College in Elizabeth City for chairman Mr Helmss political organization the National Congressional Club is organizing the McCarty campaign The Helms endorsement came even though Governor Martin has said R Jack Hawke 45 his former campaign manager is his choice for the chairmanship Historically a political party bows to the wishes of an incumbent governor as its titular head in the state in electing a chairman The contest between Mr McCarty and Mr Hawke will be played out in precinct caucuses and county conventions before being decided at the state party convention Neither Mr Martin nor Mr Helms has endorsed a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination Some state Republicans say Mr Helms may eventually enter the Republican field for the Southern primaries although he has said he has no plans to become a Presidential candidate Appealing to the Right In an endorsement letter to Mr McCarty Mr Helms argued that Republicans lost a Senate seat from North Carolina last year because their candidate James T Broyhill did not attract enough support from conservative Democrats in the states coastal plain Mr Broyhill a former Representative who lost his Senate seat to Terry Sanford is a political associate of Governor Martin While the Helms forces seek an ideologically based party to appeal to conservative voters more moderate Republicans with the Governor as their leader want to build strength in the growing cities and suburbs Raymond A Warren the deputy state House Republican leader said A victory by Mr McCarty would stifle Republican development in urban areas The outcome of the race said Mr Warren is going to determine whether were going to be a twoparty state or slip back into oneparty dominance Worries on Martin Reelection The Governor and his allies worry that the challenge from the Helms forces may make it more difficult for Mr Martin to win reelection in 1988 Mr Martin who won the governorship in 1984 faces a challenge from Lieut Gov Robert B Jordan 3d a Democrat Both Mr Hawke and Mr McCarty have served in the Martin administration Mr Hawke was director of the Office of Policy and Planning before stepping down to become interim Republican chairman at the Governors request The position became vacant when the former chairman Robert Bradshaw returned to law practice shortly after the 1986 elections Mr McCarty is chairman of the State Social Services Board a position in which he has fought state financing of abortions The Governor has not asked Mr McCarty to give up this appointive post
THE COUNTY'S UNPAID CONSULTANTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/the-countys-unpaid-consultants.html,LEAD THEY are about 600 in number and although most work without pay or real power for the most part they take their jobs very seriously THEY are about 600 in number and although most work without pay or real power for the most part they take their jobs very seriously They are the Westchester residents who serve on 58 socalled citzens boards  boards that deal with topics ranging from the County Airport utility rates transportation and the needs of the elderly women the disabled or Hispanic concerns There are other committees to focus on the interests of consumers the homeless and labor to deal with ethics in government to help with county planning and to oversee matters relating to the countys Department of Public Safety This is part of the secret of Westchesters success  that we have so many nonpaid consultants who work for the county said County Executive Andrew P ORourke who is responsible for making most of the appointments to these committees During Mr ORourkes four years as County Executive he has created numerous new citizens panels  some of them just on a temporary basis  most recently a Charterrevision committee to make suggestions on whether the County Charter should be rewritten The amount of power and influence the citizens boards have depends on a number of factors whether they have statutory power or are just an advisory committee whether they are involved with major publicpolicy issues and whether the particular board is active and politically astute Some county legislators are not totally satisfied with the way Mr ORourke uses all of these panels I think at times committees may hinder the process of government said Stephen P Tenore a Republican legislator from New Rochelle who is Chairman of the Board of Legislators Committee on County Officers and Departments which is responsible for confirming Mr ORourkes appointees In the year it took the Homeless Commission to organize we could have been doing more to help the homeless he said as way of an example referring to a panel Mr ORourke created last year In response Mr ORourke said he objected to the implication that the county government had not been helping the homeless while the commission deliberated A charge that Mr ORourke was making too little use of some other committees was voiced by Sandra R Galef of Ossining the Democratic minority leader on the County Board of Legislators She said that the Refuse District Advisory Board created by Mr ORourke to deal with garbagedisposal matters was too frequently not consulted on major garbage issues And she said she would like to hear more from the Consumer Advisory Board that was created in the mid1970s after the county enacted the consumer code According to Joseph L Colosimo Chairman of the Refuse Board communications between the administration and the Refuse Board greatly improved after he complained publicly about the problem As to Mrs Galefs concerns about the consumer board Jeffrey A Kosterich a member said that the panel had concerned itself with recently enacted amendments to the countys consumer code but that the board itself had no power I think a consumer board should be created with more power he said adding that it should be composed of people with a lot of expertise in the area I dont think of myself as being qualified to serve on such a panel he said Of the boards with no statutory power the Refuse Board and the Airport Advisory Board are among the most active and as a consequence influential with legislators They meet monthly regularly comment on relevant issues and make their opinions known to the media and public officials Many of our ideas have been incorporated into county policy said Mr Colosimo pointing out that the Refuse Board was at the forefront of the push to develop a garbagerecycling program throughout the county Irene Sandford Chairman of the Airport Board said her panel had increasingly become influential because we have been objective The panel now has prime responsibility for evaluating raw data about noise around the airport she said Another active group is the Advisory Committee for the Aging a panel required by state law to be in place before the county may receive funds through its Office for the Aging The committee advises the county on the spending of such state funds Anton Cernik its Chairman said members of this county panel were active in many groups that worked on behalf of the elderly At the other end of the age spectrum is an active County Youth Board In contrast to the committees dealing with concerns of the aging and young people the Womens Advisory Board has been the focus of some controversy from the day it was created by Mr ORourke in 1984 to replace a womens council The allegation at the time was that Mr ORourke was disbanding the first group because of its strong stand favoring abortion Mr ORourke countered that he was creating a more meaningful committee Most recently the panel was the center of some controversy when Mr Tenores committee rejected Mr ORourkes nomination of Cheryl TateLambert to serve on it Mr Tenore asserted that Ms TateLambert who is active in the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion had not dissociated herself from what he called the coalitions misrepresentation of his and other legislators position on abortion Other controversies involving citizens panels have erupted over the years when they were formed to replace panels having real power For example in the mid1970s when the county created a Department of Mental Health a citizens panel with real power to oversee mentalhealth programs was replaced with the Community Service Board an advisory board Boards that still have statutory powers include the Board of Health which a number of years ago adopted a county law banning smoking in some public places the Parks Recreation and Conservation Advisory Board which is responsible for setting recreation fees in county parks the Industrial Development Agency which helps businesses expand or relocate by assisting them in obtaining lowinterest financing While in many cases these boards go along with the requests of the administration they are not legally bound to do so In 1984 for example the thenCommissioner of Public Safety Daniel Guido resigned because of disagreement with the procedure that gave the Police Advisory Board not the Police Commissioner the final word on punishments of police officers found guilty of violating internal regulations The Police Board had reduced penalties that Mr Guido had recommended Some boards with statutory power in reality have had little or no power The threemember Stream Control Board of Appeals responsible for resolving disputes involving use or diversion of county streams has as a member George E Deren of Mount Kisco according to a list provided by Mr ORourkes office Mr Deren however said in an interview he had not served for several years Asked about this Marc Moran a spokesman for Mr ORourke said that while Mr Derens term had expired he had never been replaced and therefore technically was still on the board because he had not formally resigned The matter has not surfaced before because the board has not met formally for decades Mr Moran said adding that environmental laws had helped make the board obsolete
THE NATION; Gephardt Says He Is In For '88,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/weekinreview/the-nation-gephardt-says-he-is-in-for-88.html,Representative Richard A Gephardt Democrat of Missouri last week became the first major contender of his party to announce his candidacy for President The manner of his announcement in both style and substance showed where he centers his hopes for success Using ringing language reminiscent of John F Kennedy the 46yearold Congressman tried to preempt the issue most analysts call central to the 1988 economic debate the nations trade imbalance American workers said Mr Gephardt the cosponsor of a strict tariff and quota measure much favored by organized labor should not be sacrificed on the altar of a false and rigid freetrade ideology Former Senator Gary Hart who is leading early preference polls is less willing to be tough with countries that trade unfairly Mr Gephardt told reporters later in the day Mr Gephardt has a knack of seeing issues early He worked with then Representative David A Stockman and Senator Edward M Kenneday on comprehensive health care bills with Senator Bill Bradley he cosponsored the tax revision measure on which the Administration drew heavily But his sensitivity to political currents has also brought him criticism A mainstream Democrat in foreign policy who opposes aid to the Nicaraguan rebels and a giant military buildup the former St Louis alderman is a social conservative who until 1985 supported a constitutional amendment to ban abortions Well known in his home state whose Third Congressional District first sent him to Washington in 1976 and respected by his Congressional colleagues Mr Gephardt now draws only 1 to 3 percent recognition in polls But political professionals note that he is better known than many other potential candidates in Iowa whose caucuses are the first voting of the 1988 campaign Mr Gephardt campaigned hard there in 1986 for Democratic candidates from county commissioner to United States Senator

WOMEN IN NAZI GERMANY: PARADOXES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/02/style/women-in-nazi-germany-paradoxes.html,Time and again during the decade she spent researching the history of the forgotten women of the Third Reich Claudia Koonz was struck by a paradox the very women who were so protective of their children so warm nurturing and giving to their families could at the same time display extraordinary cruelty These same women would close the door on their Jewish neighbors or serve as the leaders of the neighborhood Nazi spy system said Dr Koonz an associate professor of history at Holy Cross College in Worcester Mass This is only one of the many apparent contradictions addressed in Dr Koonzs new book Mothers in the Fatherland Women the Family and Nazi Politics St Martins Press 25 Her account explores the roles women played in the rise of Nazism  as followers victims and resisters When she began traveling to Germany to consult neglected archives scattered about the country very little research had been done on the history of women in Nazi Germany said Dr Koonz who is 46 years old Historians primary focus had been on diplomacy and the actions of major players in the Nazi drama most of them men Indoctrinating Their Children Yet though few women were part of the formal Nazi hierarchy Dr Koonz found that the role of many women in the Third Reich was neither insignificant nor innocent They were the ones who incrementally brought Nazism home she said They indoctrinated their children in antiSemitism They were the ones who would tell their children to stop playing with the Jewish children down the block Of course Dr Koonz pointed out other German women displayed great bravery in resisting Nazi power The experiences of Jewish women and others who opposed Nazism detailed in several chapters give us great role models she said Nevertheless Dr Koonz said there was evidence to suggest that many women supported Hitler for some of the same reasons that the men did the appeal to nationalism order and stability in a nation undergoing the horrors of the Depression There was the fear of poverty among many middleclass women Dr Koonz said as well as the fear of Communism and Socialism The tragic paradox Dr Koonz said was that the Nazi Party to which they turned was misogynistic  according to its ideology women were inferior separate and subordinate Divorce for example was made easier for men than for women judges permitted men to pay less alimony than before Women also lost a degree of control over their lives In the interest of the state German women were exhorted to have more children birth control was made illegal in 1933 and familyplanning clinics were closed Dr Koonz said Abortion which had always been illegal was prosecuted more zealously But at the same time there was forced sterilization of women who were among what they called the subhuman races she said So be they Aryans or nonAryans womens bodies didnt belong to them but to their racial community In another paradox of the Third Reich there has never been a government that so thoroughly excluded women from power and yet organized them so vigorously Dr Koonz said Women like Gertrud ScholtzKlink chief of the Womens Bureau created vast bureaucracies enlisting women in activities that fostered patriotism education culture religion and health care Although the Nazi ideologues told women that they were to be supreme in the home ultimately among the loyal Nazi families the home was gutted Dr Koonz said Men went off to war children left home for Nazi schooling and Hitler youth activities Eventually women were forced to disband the homeeconomics curriculums created when they had been told Nazism was committed to the importance of traditional womens activities Instead teachers had to train women as stenographers and munitions workers to help the war effort Dr Koonzs book also grapples with the moral issues raised by the specter of women progenitors and nurturers working to support a regime responsible for so much death Does Dr Koonz believe that women are morally or emotionally superior to men No she said I suppose that will make a lot of people angry Another historian Gerda Lerner agreed Some women will find it very hard to take this bad news she said in an interview Everyone knew about Ilse Koch who was notorious for her excesses at Buchenwald But the happy illusion was that these were exceptional fanatics Here we see even German feminists turning their feminism into antiSemitism But no sex and no group has a premium on either good or evil said Dr Lerner the RobinsonEdwards Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin in Madison An authority on womens history Dr Lerner was herself imprisoned by the Nazis in Austria later she managed to escape the country at the age of 19 Lessons for Women Today Dr Lerner said Dr Koonz may also face criticism for not focusing more on the experiences of Jewish women and on Germans resistance to antiSemitism But Dr Lerner had high praise for the book adding I think womens history shows a lot of maturity when it can take on subjects like this Are there lessons for women today in the history of the Nazi experience Beware those who would create a segmented society Dr Koonz said And beware calls to revive socalled oldfashioned womanhood and subordination to men  appeals to crude nostalgic familyism  Do those who write history have faith that we are not condemned to repeat it Remember the conditions were extreme she said of Depressionera Germany You would need to recreate the conditions of economic collapse political disarray and cultural confusion

PRESIDENT ASSERTS HE IS MOVING AWAY FROM IRAN AFFAIR,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/06/us/president-asserts-he-is-moving-away-from-iran-affair.html,President Reagan said today that enough time had been spent on inside Washington politics and that he would not allow the rest of his Presidency to be hindered by the Iran arms affair Attempting to focus public and Congressional attention away from the scandal an effort that began with a nationally broadcast speech Wednesday night Mr Reagan said he would move on to other business while various investigations of the arms deals run their course The remarks came as a CBS News Poll showed that the speech had brought a significant increase in his approval rating White House officials said they believed Mr Reagans speech had created a climate in which there would be less clamor over the Iran affair among the public and in Congress In his address the President accepted full responsibility for the Iran initiative and acknowledged for the first time that it had deteriorated into a trade of arms for hostages Sizzle but Not Much Steak But Democratic leaders asserted that the speech had not solved the problems raised by the Iran arms sales and the reported diversion of some of the profits to the Nicaraguan rebels There was a lot of sizzle but not much steak said Bruce E Babbitt the former Governor of Arizona Representative Barney Frank Democrat of Massachusetts said a Presidential review board that last week criticized Mr Reagan and his Administrations Iran policy never said he was a lousy speechmaker They said he was a lousy President Mr Frank said House Democrats said today that they planned a vote next week to cut off aid to the Nicaraguan rebels who are said to have received tens of millions of dollars in profits from the Iran arms sales Leaders said the vote would highlight what they said was the White Houses failure to explain the diversion of money to the rebels A Sense of Relief By contrast White House officials and Republicans in Congress praised the speech as a turning point saying that it had created a sense of relief among top advisers to Mr Reagan Reagan isnt altogether out of the woods but hes certainly gotten to the firebreak said Representative Robert Michel of Illinois the leader of the House Republicans Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the leader of the Senates Republican minority said the Iran affair is not behind the President yet but its a start White House officials said the public response to the Presidents speech has been overwhelmingly supportive As of this morning they said 3645 favorable telephone calls had been received and 247 negative ones tallied The CBS News Poll conducted immediately after the speech found that the address substantially improved Mr Reagans standing with the public but had not allayed doubts about his handling of the Iran affair or his capacity to govern through the remaining two years of his term The telephone survey of 510 respondents taken Wednesday evening found that 51 percent approved of Mr Reagans handling of his job and 42 percent disapproved The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points The poll results represented a sharp turnaround from a New York Times CBS News Poll taken last weekend which found that only 42 percent approved of Mr Reagans job performance The latest poll however found that by a margin of 2 to 1 the public did not believe that Mr Reagan had told everything he knew about the scandal Substantial majorities also said the Iran affair would handicap him for the rest of his term and supported pressing on with the various Congressional and judicial inquiries under way Speaks to Newspaper Group Mr Reagan who spoke to members of the National Newspaper Association in the Old Executive Office Building today said Weve spent enough time the last few months on inside Washington politics  whos up and whos down and whos in and out Mr Fitzwater said Administration officials felt they needed to convey that the President and his senior officials are serious about getting the White House well organized and well managed It is incumbent on us to settle down and show progress on foreign policy and domestic issues he said adding that aides felt that a weight had been lifted from the White House In terms of the President people feel very excited for him Mr Fitzwater said Mr Reagan is expected to face a legislative test next week when the House votes on the proposal to cut off assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels Congress has banned United States spending on military aid to the rebels but authorized 27 million in 1986 for such equipment as trucks and helicopters for medical evacuation Democrats Mulling Challenges In addition the Democratic leadership in Congress is also considering challenging the President on issues other than Iran including the budget deficit and foreign trade according to one Congressional aide We dont want to make the mistake we made with Watergate and see Iran as our savior he said We have to keep our eye on the ball which is our domestic economic agenda Mr Reagan made a similar point when he met with some conservative Republican senators today saying that he wanted to pursue an aggressive and broad legislative agenda Mr Fitzwater said The President cited several priorities including his plan to deploy satellites capable of defending against Soviet missiles a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and legislation to prohibit abortions Mr Fitzwater said He was very outgoing and in a feisty mood Mr Fitzwater said I think hes ready to get back in the harness fighting for his legislation Reassurance for Conservatives The meeting also represented an attempt by White House officials to reassure conservative supporters of the President that they had nothing to worry about the selection of former Senator Howard H Baker Jr as chief of staff Before the meeting Mr Baker held a lunch with several leading conservatives including Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d Edward J Feulner Jr the president of the Heritage Foundation and former Senator Paul Laxalt One participant at the session said that the purpose was to send a message to conservatives to quiet them down and to calm them down The participant said that Mr Baker assured the conservatives that he had no agenda of his own and that the President is the President Mr Bakers problems with conservatives many of whom believe he is not committed to their ideological aims have persisted since he served as Senate majority leader throughout Mr Reagans first term Howard Bakers specialty in life is blurring issues pale pastels compromise conciliation said one such idelogical conservative

Mr. Reagan's Third Term,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/08/opinion/mr-reagan-s-third-term.html,Now what should happen when you make a mistake is this You take your knocks you learn your lessons and then you move on    You put things in perspective You pull your energies together You change You go forward That doesnt sound like an inaugural address Yet an inaugural address is what President Reagans speech Wednesday amounted to an appeal for a fresh start Hes desperately eager to extricate himself from the Irancontra quagmire One could almost hear him grit his teeth as he accepted responsibility pledged obedience to the law promised energetic leadership Its not in anyones power to grant that fresh start Questions about his credibility will hang like thunderclouds until Congress and the independent counsel conclude their investigations Still the world wont stop and the Commander in Chief insists hes eager to command to start again My fellow Americans I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years If hes serious about governing not just about escaping the muck hes entitled to public support Is he serious To judge by what he says the answer is an incredulous no To judge by what he seems ready to do it may be a hopeful yes    On Thursday Mr Reagan expanded on what he wants to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years He cited his Strategic Defense Initiative a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and antiabortion legislation That would be a dispiriting list if only because the budget and abortion items are empty sloganeering Probably his most urgent task is to demonstrate respect for law in the foreign affairs arena and here the Presidents pledges offer an encouraging start His Administration has not always obeyed the letter and spirit of the law concerning Congressional consultation it will now be hard not to Mr Reagans missile defense initiative while founded in hyperbole has probably prompted Soviet flexibility on arms control The news of Secretary of State Shultz mission to Moscow in April stirs hope that Mr Reagan may yet find it possible after the Reykjavik wreckage to use his spacebased defense scheme as a bargaining counter to negotiate reductions in nuclear weapons Will he also be able to negotiate reductions with Congress in the awesome budget deficit Not if he keeps insisting on the gimmick of a balanced budget amendment and not if he keeps pretending he believes the low deficit figures in his new budget Congressional Democrats are now soberly willing to consider new taxes will the President go along and become fiscally responsible finally Congressional Democrats disposed to perilous protectionism wont show similar responsibility on trade unless the President leads He has sent Congress an appealing package of proposals to enhance American competitiveness in world trade What remains to be seen is how much he cares No legislation is needed to heal a grievous gap plain since the first days of the 1980 campaign the need to demonstrate respect and concern for black Americans The hostile chill they feel troubles Republicans and Democrats For a President who wants to accomplish a great deal with you and for you over the next two years racial and social justice would be a splendid place to start Arms control fiscal responsibility and social justice is not a liberal or a conservative but a realistic agenda Can it be realized If so the President would make his third term the one to remember
"AIDS HITS WESTERN EUROPE, MIMICKING VIRAL PATH IN U.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/09/world/aids-hits-western-europe-mimicking-viral-path-in-us.html,A story not all that unusual in Europe these days is told by JeanPaul Escande a doctor who heads the AIDS clinic at Tarnier Hospital in Paris Dr Escande told of a married woman who was both pregnant and addicted to heroin She believed and I believed also that she could have overcome her habit if she had a baby Dr Escande said But she tested positively for the AIDS virus And so there was the tragedy of AIDS I was looking in the face of someone who could have saved herself by gaining the motivation to overcome her drug habit and I had to advise her to have an abortion because the chances were just too great that her child would have died within a few months of birth Dr Escande added that on average one child infected by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus was born every day in France Europe Now Hard Hit The AIDS epidemic which once seemed to affect Africa and the United States far more severely than the rest of the world has hit hard in Western Europe in the last year or so Medical experts now expect the disease to become a major public health emergency as it has in the United States Some 4000 Western Europeans are now reported to be sick with AIDS and although they represents only a modest fraction of the 31000 cases reported in the United States the number of people coming down with AIDS in Europe is doubling every 9 to 11 months At the end of 1983 the known AIDS cases in the 12 nations of the European Community numbered 232 compared with 3354 at the end of 1986 France with 1221 has the most cases according to the World Health Organization West Germany has 875 and Britain 686 In Switzerland Denmark and Belgium the number of cases although smaller is the highest in proportion to population in Europe According to the World Health Organization half a million to one million people in Western Europe have already been infected by the virus and many will eventually become sick If 10 to 30 percent of the affected people actually develop AIDS which seems likely there will be anywhere from 50000 to 300000 deaths in Europe during the next 5 years said Jonathan Mann an American physician who heads the WHO task force in Geneva that tries to deal with the disease around the world The spread of AIDS in Europe has followed a pattern similar to that in the United States as if the disease and its effects on individuals and society replicated themselves across the Atlantic after a lag of two years AIDS in Europe started among homosexual men believed by most experts to have been infected during visits to the United States It later appeared among drug addicts who shared needles to inject themselves with heroin In the last few months concern has mounted that the virus has spread in a small degree to other groups Our specialists dont like to hear it but there are some groups that form a link between the highrisk groups and the rest of the population said Gonzague S Kistler the chief medical officer for the canton of Zurich in Switzerland Among them he said are married men who have occasional homosexual encounters and more important perhaps men who patronize prostitutes infected with the virus through drug addiction or the addiction of their clients or other sex partners Drugaddict prostitutes may play a very important role in the propagation of AIDS said Roel Coutino the chief of the AIDS office in Amsterdams health department They have a lot of contacts and they dont stop working even when they are sick because they need the money to pay for their drugs Whatever the factors involved in the spread of the disease experts agree that no Western European country is likely to be spared the epidemic Dr Kistler said that in a couple of years Europe would not be much better off than the United States We have been able to inform people of the danger earlier than they did in the United States and this is an advantage he said But in Switzerland for example the reality is that there are 50000 to 100000 homosexuals and 20000 to 30000 drug addicts Half of the drug addicts have the virus In all about 20000 people are already infected If there is not a dramatic change in behavior Dr Kistler said many in these highrisk groups will die and usually the members of the high risk groups do not change their behavior dramatically Centers of Infection First Major Cities As in the United States the disease struck first at the major cities particularly those where both homosexuality and drug addiction are widespread In the United States most victims have been homosexual men or intravenous drug users and the sexual partners of people in those two groups Four percent of the cases have been attributed to viruses spread through heterosexual intercourse In some African countries however where AIDS is believed to be epidemic the disease is believed to be spread predominantly by heterosexual transmission Experts say that the high incidence of AIDS in Zurich which is the most heavily affected single city in Europe is almost surely due to its wealth the cosmopolitan nature of its population and the fact that the Swiss travel a great deal to other countries We have the image of being very conservative but the image is wrong said Roger Staub the head of the Swiss AIDS Foundation a private group that conducts educational programs intended to prevent the disease Zurich has one of the biggest gay scenes in Europe one of the biggest drug scenes and one of the biggest sex markets There is a sharp difference in the spread of the disease between the countries of southern Europe in particular Italy and Spain where more than half of those infected are drug users and the northern parts of the continent where homosexual men are a large majority of victims One possible reason is that homosexuality is less accepted and less openly practiced in the southern largely Catholic countries than it is in the more liberal north In Italy for example AIDS experts say that there are far fewer open homosexual clubs bars and bathhouses than in the United States and other European countries and that Italian homosexuals tend to have fewer partners than those elsewhere Yet in Italy a truck driver recently killed himself and his wife and son because he suspected incorrectly that he had AIDS Some specialists say that Italy has experienced a spread of heroin use by people who can spread the AIDS virus by sharing needles There is a large group of people who overcame drug addiction before 1984 or 1985 and do not realize that they were at risk said Fernando Aiuti the chief of the AIDS clinic at Romes University Hospital About 30 to 35 percent of them are infected and so are 10 to 15 percent of their partners So the infection rate is continuing to go up among drug users and former drug users and unless we can stop the pattern the partners of their partners will spread the disease further One of the first cases I saw of a drug addict infected with the virus came in 1984 The patients wife who was not a drug user also tested positively for the virus She gave birth to a child in December 1985 The child got AIDS in April of the next year and in August he died In September Dr Aiuti went on the mother got very sick She died in October Now the father has the disease and weighed down with the feeling that he was responsible for having destroyed the other members of his family he is considering suicide He is 23 years old Perhaps the most tragic case Ive seen was that of a 16yearold girl who got sick after having her first sexual experience She spent a week with a man who later admitted that he was a drug addict The girl is so young and naive that she has not understood how serious her problem is and neither does her family They do not realize that she is going to die A Victims Story Starting to Fight Back It was two years ago that Harry Hogerhorst who had lived with his male lover near Amsterdam for 17 years learned that he had AIDS and would almost certainly die from it Mr Hogerhorst now 39 years old was at first devastated and fell into a deep depression His companion died of the disease he was rejected at first by his own parents who had never accepted his homosexuality and by those of his companion a prosperous businessman who had supported him After my friend died a year and a half ago I realized that I wanted to do something for other people like myself who had AIDS he said in a recent interview In a burst of activity interspersed with periods of hospitalization Mr Hogerhorst founded the Dutch Union for AIDS Patients known as the BMA after its initials in Dutch Along with a colleague who has since died Mr Hogerhorst gave newspaper and television interviews in which he freely talked about his illness appealing among other things for donations to create hostels where other victims could receive treatment According to David Stein an American living in Amsterdam who counsels him Mr Hogerhorsts creation of the group helped him to overcome the depression and sense of futility that affect many people who get AIDS Mr Hogerhorst who collapsed last week during a meeting of the BMA and is now in the hospital was asked what message he had for other AIDS patients I would tell them that there are many things you can do even if you have AIDS he said Before I had the disease I didnt realize all the things I could accomplish The BMA is similar to other private organizations that have sprung up elsewhere in Europe and reflect what amounts to a general mobilization by AIDS victims themselves and by governments both to treat patients and to prevent the spread of the disease In Europe the response to AIDS has varied from expressions of alarm and demands for the quarantine of infected people to splashy publicity campaigns in which subjects rarely before discussed in public are being openly aired Several countries have begun to plan ways to provide care outside of hospitals for AIDS victims whose numbers could eventually strain the capacities of health systems In England the Health Secretary Norman Fowler has called for the creation of hospices to treat the large number of AIDS cases expected In France the Help Association a group founded by homosexuals will maintain apartments where patients not cared for by friends or families can be treated The Swiss AIDS Association a private group with offices in most Swiss cities has developed a new condom and marketed it directly to homosexual bars clubs and bathhouses The group wrote to 6000 people most of them women who advertise in the numerous sexexchange magazines warning them of the danger of AIDS Officials in several countries say that demands to isolate AIDS patients or to quarantine them in special hospitals have been remarkably limited given the terrifying nature of the disease Yet alarm has been expressed in most places where AIDS has spread In Britain Julien Peto an epidemiologist at the Institute of Cancer Research has argued that all people should be required to carry cards showing they have been tested for the disease How many people can honestly say that they would prefer to see AIDS continue to spread until it dominates many peoples sexual and social lives rather than isolating 30000 homosexuals or drug addicts and perhaps a further 10000 who have caught the disease in other ways Dr Peto asked in a newspaper column last month In Sweden and in West Germany some conservatives have demanded that all people testing positively for the AIDS virus be tattooed so they can be readily identified by those with whom they might have sexual contact None of these proposals has been adopted but in southern Germany the conservative government in Bavaria adopted tough measures after the central Government rejected its demand that that all people infected with the AIDS virus be registered nationally August Lang the Bavarian Interior Minister announced last month that tests for infection with the AIDS virus would become mandatory for some groups including prostitutes prison inmates and some foreigners who want to live in Bavaria He said that homosexual bathhouses would be banned and that there would be mandatory testing of people arrested in raids on such establishments The commercialization of sex with peep shows porno shops organized prostitution mens saunas and sex clubs has created an ideal biotope for AIDS Peter Gauweiler an official in Mr Langs ministry wrote in the magazine Der Speigel The state must have the right to break the chain of infection Debate on Prevention Isolation or Education The measures in Bavaria have been criticized as exaggerated alarmist and most important ineffective in fighting the AIDS epidemic Most European governments have resisted calls for what has come to be called ghettoization of the disease which cannot be transmitted without intimate sexual contact or an exchange of blood according to medical experts You cannot control peoples sexual lives in our societies Dr Coutino of Amsterdams health department said Its not a question of tolerance of certain kinds of behavior its a question of whether you can do anything effective about it and I dont think you can A campaign in Britain which began last year has been perhaps the most visible in Europe with posters and television advertisements using the slogan Dont die of ignorance In Switzerland a brochure containing information about AIDS was mailed to every household In France the Minister of Health Michele Barzach has proposed that an AIDS test be mandatory for all couples wishing to get married  not to prevent marriage by those testing positively but to insure they know the danger they face We are taking an approach somewhat different from Britain where the emphasis is almost entirely on information Mrs Barzach said We have to take a more discreet approach or we will risk the phenomenon of rejection by some who dont like to be ordered what to do We have a lot of fears but also a little bit of hope regarding AIDS The stress needs to be put on the notion that its an avoidable disease
"2,000 CATHOLICS LOBBY OFFICIALS IN ALBANY VISIT",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/nyregion/2000-catholics-lobby-officials-in-albany-visit.html,Two thousand Roman Catholics  led by all eight bishops of New York State including John Cardinal OConnor  swept through the halls of state government today They lobbied for the Catholic view on legislation calling for greater aid for the poor and protesting that the government was pressuring the church to compromise some of its basic beliefs There are those who ask us as members of the Catholic church what right we have to address the forum of public policy the Cardinal said at the Convention Center here in a speech to the 2000 Catholics that was attended by most of the leaders of state government both Catholic and nonCatholic I ask What right do we not have to address it We cannot afford the luxury of silence One need not hold public office as the Governor does or live on a fashionable street as I do to look out the window and see people literally sleeping in the street in the bitter cold he continued saying that he was speaking for 66 million Catholics in the state There is something terribly wrong Improved Services Sought Throughout the day nuns priests and lay people carrying a list of legislators by diocese moved from office to office and detailed the more than two dozen items on the church agenda It was the first time anyone here could recall such a large lobbying based on religion Among the items sought were the elimination of state aid for abortion opposition to giving terminally ill people the right to refuse lifesaving measures an increase in welfare benefits better access to health care for those without medical insurance tax credits for parents who send their children to nonpublic schools more housing for the homeless and more daycare centers affordable to lowincome families In addition the bishops said the state should not return to taxpayers all the extra taxes it would collect because of revisions in the Federal tax code Governor Cuomo and legislators have pledged to return all the money known here as the windfall The bishops argued that part should be used to improve services for the poor and elderly Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany one of the organizers of todays lobbying said no specific issue had led to the Catholics gathering here He said the bishops had been talking about it for some time feeling that they had to find a way to get their story out to the public Cardinal OConnor acknowledged that some of the agenda was purely Catholic But he maintained that much of it was nondenominational and that the focus was on assuring the dignity of every human being Many of his comments seemed aimed at turning back on the Governor some of Mr Cuomos own statements and the Cardinals speech was filled with pointed remarks  most humorous but some seemingly not  at Mr Cuomo who sat behind him shifting in his chair Last week the Governor renewed a call for the teaching of social values in the schools Today the Cardinal seized on that and said the mandate must be broader We must go about the business of restoring values in the whole spectrum of public life he said adding that the church had a role to play in helping guide lawmakers in decisions of morality Frequently Mr Cuomo says that the state cannot build all the housing needed for the homeless and that the private sector must play a role The Cardinal said today that the private sector such as the church cannot be expected to build all the housing Partnerships Importance Three years ago Mr Cuomo then in the middle of a dispute with Cardinal OConnor traveled to a Catholic bastion the University of Notre Dame to argue that religion had no role in government and that a Catholic in public office did not have to follow the teachings of the church in effecting public policy The Cardinal traveled today to a government bastion to say that there is surely an appropriate role for us to play in assisting our public officials A statement by all the bishops stressed the importance of the partnership between church and state in meeting the needs of our states residents Mr Cuomo and the Cardinal have frequently been at odds The Governor spoke at Notre Dame after the Cardinal said that as a Catholic Mr Cuomo was obligated to do everything in his power to block the use of public funds to pay for abortions which Mr Cuomo said he was not obligated to do Last summer the Governor took issue with a policy by the Archdiocese of New York that encouraged pastors not to allow public officials who disagree with church teachings to speak at parish functions Archdiocese officials have complained publicly that they resented what they saw as the Governor lecturing them on church policy In a joking reference to that the Cardinal said today that Mr Cuomo was well aware of what a papal encyclical was because he writes encyclicals Upholding Moral Law At another point in what some legislators in the audience took as a reference to his dispute with Mr Cuomo over the use of public funds to pay for abortions the Cardinal said Neither the Governor nor anyone else as the Governor so well knows has the right to violate the Bible or moral law on the grounds that this will achieve some good for the people here and now Repeatedly the Cardinal depicted the church as being hampered by government in its efforts to serve society as a whole He said tests showed that parochial school students fared as well if not better than public school students yet the state will not give tax credits to parents to help offset the cost of parochial schools Referring to a court decision that fostercare programs run by the archdiocese must provide children with access to familyplanning information the Cardinal who has said he will discontinue some of the programs rather than comply commented Now we are being told that if we are to be allowed to assist the city any longer we must reject our moral priorities The Governor who kissed the Cardinals ring when he greeted him at the Convention Center praised the elements of his speech that said many of the concerns of Catholics were the concerns of all Americans Pressed for further reaction he added Hes a great communicator Both the Cardinal and the Governor who made brief remarks to the group received standing ovations

diagnostic procedures which do not offer sufficient guarantees of their honest purpose and substantial harmlessness And if as often happens in human choices a degree of risk must be undertaken he will

THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE  TEXT OF VATICAN'S DOCTRINAL STATEMENT ON HUMAN REPRODUCTION; PART I: RESPECT FOR HUMAN EMBRYOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/vatican-birth-science-text-vatican-s-doctrinal-statement-human-reproduction-part-370987.html,Following is the text a Vatican doctrinal statement Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation Replies to Certain Questions of the Day issued yesterday Careful reflection on this teaching of the Magisterium and on the evidence of reason as mentioned above enables us to respond to the numerous moral problems posed by technical interventions upon the human being in the first phases of his life and upon the processes of his conception 1 What respect is due to the human embryo taking into account his nature and identity The human being must be respected  as a person  from the very first instant of his existence The implementation of procedures of artificial fertilization has made possible various interventions upon embryos and human foetuses The aims pursued are of various kinds diagnostic and therapeutic scientific and commercial From all of this serious problems arise Can one speak of a right to experimentation upon human embryos for the purpose of scientific research What norms or laws should be worked out with regard to this matter The response to these problems presupposes a detailed reflection on the nature and specific identity  the word status is used  of the human embryo itself At the Second Vatican Council the Church for her part presented once again to modern man her constant and certain doctrine according to which Life once conceived must be protected with the utmost care abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes More recently the Charter of the Rights of the Family published by the Holy See [ 23 ] confirmed that Human life must be absolutely respected and protected from the moment of conception [ 24 ] This Congregation is aware of the current debates concerning the beginning of human life concerning the individuality of the human being and concerning the identity of the human person The Congregation recalls the teachings found in the Declaration on Procured Abortion From the time that the ovum is fertilized a new life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother it is rather the life of a new human being with his own growth It would never be made human if it were not human already To this perpetual evidence    modern genetic science brings valuable confirmation It has demonstrated that from the first instant the programme is fixed as to what this living being will be a man this individualman with his characteristic aspects already well determined Right from fertilization is begun the adventure of a human life and each of its great capacities requires time    to find its place and to be in a position to act [ 25 ] This teaching remains valid and is further confirmed if confirmation were needed by recent findings of human biological science which recognize that in the zygote  resulting from fertilization the biological identity of a new human individual is already constituted Certainly no experimental datum can be in itself sufficient to bring us to the recognition of a spiritual soul nevertheless the conclusions of science regarding the human embryo provide a valuable indication for discerning by the use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance of a human life how could a human individual not be a human person The Magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a philosophical nature but it constantly reaffirms the moral condemnation of any kind of procured abortion This teaching has not been changed and is unchangeable [ 26 ] Thus the fruit of human generation from the first moment of its existence that is to say from the moment the zygote has formed demands the unconditional respect that is morally due to the human being in his bodily and spiritual totality The human being is to be respected and treated as a person from the moment of conception and therefore from that same moment his rights as a person must be recognized among which in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human being to life This doctrinal reminder provides the fundamental criterion for the solution of the various problems posed by the development of the biomedical sciences in this field since the embryo must be treated as a person it must also be defended in its integrity tended and cared for to the extent possible in the same way as any other human being as far as medical assistance is concerned 2 Is Prenatal Diagnosis Morally Licit If prenatal diagnosis respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed towards its safeguarding or healing as an individual then the answer is affirmative For prenatal diagnosis makes it possible to know the condition of the embryo and of the fetus when still in the mothers womb It permits or makes it possible to anticipate earlier and more effectively certain therapeutic medical or surgical procedures Such diagnosis is permissible with the consent of the parents after they have been adequately informed if the methods employed safeguard the life and integrity of the embryo and the mother without subjecting them to disproportionate risks [ 27 ] But this diagnosis is gravely opposed to the moral law when it is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion depending upon the results a diagnosis which shows the existence of a malformation or a hereditary illness must not be the equivalent of a deathsentence Thus a woman would be committing a gravely illicit act if she were to request such a diagnosis with the deliberate intention of having an abortion should the results confirm the existence of a malformation or abnormality The spouse or relatives or anyone else would similarly be acting in a manner contrary to the moral law if they were to counsel or impose such a diagnostic procedure on the expectant mother with the same intention of possibly proceeding to an abortion So too the specialist would be guilty of illicit collaboration if in conducting the diagnosis and in communicating its results he were deliberately to contribute to establishing or favoring a link between prenatal diagnosis and abortion In conclusion any directive or program of the civil and health authorities or of scientific organizations which in any way were to favor a link between prenatal diagnosis and abortion or which were to go as far as directly to induce expectant mothers to submit to prenatal diagnosis planned for the purpose of eliminating fetuses which are affected by malformations or which are carriers of hereditary illness is to be condemned as a violation of the unborn childs right to life and as an abuse of the prior rights and duties of the spouses 3 Are Therapeutic Procedures Carried Out on the Human Embryo Licit As with all medical interventions on patients one must uphold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it but are directed towards its healing the improvement of its condition of health or its individual survival Whatever the type of medical surgical or other therapy the free and informed consent of the parents is required according to the deontological rules followed in the case of children The application of this moral principle may call for delicate and particular precautions in the case of embryonic or fetal life The legitimacy and criteria of such procedures have been clearly stated by Pope John Paul II A strictly therapeutic intervention whose explicit objective is the healing of various maladies such as those stemming from chromosomal defects will in principle be considered desirable provided it is directed to the true promotion of the personal wellbeing of the individual without doing harm to his integrity or worsening his conditions of life Such an intervention would indeed fall within the logic of the Christian moral tradition [ 28 ] 4 How Is One to Evaluate Morally Research and Experimentation on Human Embryos and Fetuses Medical research must refrain from operations on live embryos unless there is a moral certainty of not causing harm to the life or integrity of the unborn child and the mother and on condition that the parents have given their free and informed consent to the procedure It follows that all research even when limited to the simple observation of the embryo would become illicit were it to involve risk to the embryos physical integrity or life by reason of the methods used or the effects induced As regards experimentation and presupposing the general distinction between experimentation for purposes which are not directly therapeutic and experimentation which is clearly therapeutic for the subject himself in the case in point one must also distinguish between experimentation carried out on embryos which are still alive and experimentation carried out on embryos which are dead If the embryos are living whether viable or not they must be respcted just like any other human person experimentation on embryos which is not directly therapeutic is illicit [ 29 ] No objective even though noble in itself such as a foreseeable advantage to science to other human beings or to society can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses whether viable or not either inside or outside the mothers womb The informed consent ordinarily required for clinical experimentation on adults cannot be granted by the parents who may not freely dispose of the physical integrity or life of the unborn child Moreover experimentation on embryos and fetuses always involves risk and indeed in most cases it involves the certain expectation of harm to their physical integrity or even their death To use human embryos or fetuses as the object or instrument of experimentation constitutes a crime against their dignity as humman beings having a right to the same respect that is due to the child already born and to every human person The Charter of the Rights of the Family published by the Holy See affirms Respect for the dignity of the human being excludes all experimental manipulation or exploitation of the human embryo [ 30 ] The practice of keeping alive human embryos in vivo or in vitro for experimental or commercial purposes is totally opposed to human dignity In the case of experimentation that is clearly therapeutic namely when it is a matter of experimental forms of therapy used for the benefit of the embryo itself in a final attempt to save its life and in the absence of other reliable forms of therapy recourse to drugs or procedures not yet fully tested can be licit [ 31 ] The corpses of human embryos and fetuses whether they have been deliberately aborted or not must be respected just as the remains of other human beings In particular they cannot be subjected to mutilation or to autopsies if their death has not yet been verified and without the consent of the parents or of the mother Furthermore the moral requirements must be safeguarded that there be no complicity in deliberate abortion and that the risk of scandal be avoided Also in the case of dead fetuses as for the corpses of adult persons all commerical trafficking must be considered illicit and should be prohibited 5 How is one to evaluate morally the use for research purposes of embryos obtained by fertilization in vitro Human embryos obtained in vitro are human beings and subjects with rights their dignity and right to life must be respected from the first moment of their existence It is immoral to produce human embryos destined to be exploited as disposable biological material In the usual practice of in vitro fertilization not all of the embryos are transferred to the womans body some are destroyed Just as the Church condemns induced abortion so she also forbids acts against the life of these human beings It is a duty to condemn the particular gravity of the voluntary destruction of human embryos obtained in vitro for the sole purpose of research either by means of artifical insemination of by means of twin fission By acting in this way the researcher usurps the place of God and even though he may be unaware of this he sets himself up as the master of the destiny of others inasmuch as he arbitrarily chooses whom he will allow to live and whom he will send to death and kills defenseless human beings Methods of observation or experimentation which damage or impose grave and disproportionate risks upon embryos obtained in vitro are morally illicit for the same reasons Every human being is to be respected for himself and cannot be reduced in worth to a pure and simple instrument for the advantage of others It is therefore not in conformity with the moral law deliberately to expose to death human embryos obtained in vitro In consequence of the fact that they have been produced in vitro those embryos which are not transferred into the body of the mother and are called spare are exposed to an absurd fate with no possibility of their being offered safe means of survival which can be licitly pursued 6 What judgment should be made on other procedures of manipulating embryos connected with the techniques of human reproduction Techniques of fertilization in vitro can open the way to other forms of biological and genetic manipulation of human embryos such as attempts or plans for fertilization between human and animal gametes and the gestation of human embryos in the uterus of animals or the hypothesis or project of constructing artificial uteruses for the human embryos These procedures are contrary to the human dignity proper to the embryo and at the same time they are contrary to the right of every person to be conceived and to be born within marriage and from marriage [ 32 ] Also attempts or hypotheses for obtaining a human being without any connection with sexuality through twin fission cloning or parthenogenesis are to be considered contrary to the moral law since they are in opposition to the dignity both of human procreation and of the conjugal union The freezing of embryos even when carried out in order to preserve the life of an embryo  cryopreservation  constitutes an offence against the respect due to human beings by exposing them to grave risks of death or harm to their physical integrity and depriving them at least temporarily of maternal shelter and gestation thus placing them in a situation in which further offenses and manipulation are possible Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities These manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his or her integrity and identity Therefore in no way can they be justified on the grounds of possible beneficial consequences for future humanity [ 33 ] Every person must be respected for himself in this consists the dignity and right of every human being from his or her beginning  The zygote is the cell produced when the nuclei of the two gametes have fused  Since the terms research and experimentation are often used equivalently and ambiguously it is deemed necessary to specify the exact meaning given them in this document 1 By research is meant any inductivedeductive process which aims at promoting the systematic observation of a given phenomenon in the human field or at verifying a hypothesis arising from previous observations 2 By experimentation is meant any research in which the human being in the various stages of his existence embryo fetus child or adult represents the object through which or upon which one intends to verify the effect at present unknown or not sufficiently known of a given treatment eg pharmacological teratogenic surgical etc
THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE; HOSPITALS ACTED AHEAD OF THE VATICAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/the-vatican-on-birth-science-hospitals-acted-ahead-of-the-vatican.html,Roman Catholic medical experts said yesterday that many of the Vaticans new teachings on human reproduction had already been incorporated into the medical practices of hospitals affiliated with the church One group of church hospitals coincidenally decided yesterday to discourage surrogate mothers who bear children for others from having their babies in the groups institutions But nonCatholic physicians involved in reproductive technology condemned the new church instructions and defended their work on the ground that it was no more intrusive than other accepted medical practices NonCatholic hospitals that offer more radical fertility services including sperm banks and invitro fertilization said they would continue to offer the services because of the joy they bring to childless couples The Vaticans ruling condemning surrogate motherhood meanwhile left Noel P Keane who has the countrys leading law practice devoted to arranging surrogate births saddened but undaunted Mr Keane a Catholic from Dearborn Mich arranged for Mary Beth Whitehead to become the surrogate mother of Baby M in New Jersey The only response I could make may sound a little insensitive he said but I think the church is a little out of touch with the reality of all the Catholic couples who want children to say Youve been dealt this hand by God and youre going to have to live with it  Effect on Legislation In New Jersey the lawyers representing Mrs Whitehead and William Stern the father of Baby M in a court battle for custody said they expected the Vatican document to effect legislation regulating surrogate motherhood which is not legal in any state Gary N Skoloff a lawyer for Mr Stern predicted that liberal states would enact laws legalizing surrogate contracts and conservative states would not But for the large majority of states somewhere in the middle he said this kind of edict from the Pope will carry some weight negatively Harold J Cassidy the lawyer for Mrs Whitehead and a Catholic who once studied for the priesthood said a third of the country is Catholic and required to abide by the Vaticans statement The courts he added cannot ignore prevailing social attitudes about the morality of surrogateparenting arrangements The Sisters of Bon Secours which operates Catholic hospitals including four in the East passed a resolution yesterday discouraging surrogate mothers from having their babies delivered at the orders hospitals The decision to take up this question said Anne Neal an ethicist with the hospitals was prompted when Mr Keane asked the orders hospital in Grosse Pointe Mich to deliver a surrogate mothers twins last August The hospital asked her to look elsewhere We thought we could do our little bit to discourage the whole surrogate arrangement by saying in advance that we chose not to we preferred not to participate in the delivery she said The groups hospitals would never turn away a woman who was a surrogate Ms Neal added nor would they inquire into the nature of each birth but officials hope instead that doctors will respect the hospitals views In any case she said the Bon Secours hospitals would deal only with the mother on questions of medical care or payment for services and would release the baby only to its mother Some hospitals allow the surrogate mother to leave early and release the baby to the biological father and his wife NonCatholic hospitals with advanced fertility programs gave little indication of a willingness to be bound by the Vaticans new teachings We do have an invitro fertilization program and I must tell you that we have pretty much not gotten into discussing this issue with the press because it is a religious issue and we dont like to discuss religious issues said Amy McVay Abbott spokeswoman for the Humana Womens Hospital in Tampa Fla These programs are simply here to service infertile women she added The hospital is part of a nationwide forprofit hospital chain Dr Ewa Iradwanska a physician at Rush Presbyterian St Lukes Medical Center in Chicago argued that the invitro fertilization program she works with is similar to any other bypass operation in that it seeks to overcome a natural blockage Because of the involuntary nature of sterility she added it is also morally distinguishible from voluntary measures such as abortion or surrogatemotherhood arrangments Process Is Gods Will Since we started this program I have never had any reason to think that there is anything inappropriate in it Dr Iradwanska said And I am certainly supported by my patients who say If the process works it must certainly be Gods will  Rush Presbyterian does not participate in arranging surrogatemother agreements said Carolyn Reed the centers spokeswoman Some Catholic physicians and hospitals are developing techniques to relieve infertility in married couples without running afoul of the Vaticans teaching When damaged Fallopian tubes impede the movement of the egg for example the doctor may move the egg to the lower portion of the tube for natural fertilization What is acceptable and not acceptable under Catholic teaching really gets down to splitting hairs said Elizabeth McMillan an ethicist with the Catholic Health Organization in St Louis If the degree of intrusion is such that you violate the integrity of the marital act and if in the end you have a child born not of a marital act then you have done what the Vatican says is clearly immoral
THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE  TEXT OF VATICAN'S DOCTRINAL STATEMENT ON HUMAN REPRODUCTION; PART II: INTERVENTIONS UPON HUMAN PROCREATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/vatican-birth-science-text-vatican-s-doctrinal-statement-human-reproduction-part-371287.html,Following is the text a Vatican doctrinal statement Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation Replies to Certain Questions of the Day issued yesterday By artificial procreation or artificial fertilization are understood here the different technical procedures directed towards obtaining a human conception in a manner other than the sexual union of man and woman This Instruction deals with fertilization of an ovum in a testtube in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination through transfer into the womans genital tracts of previously collected sperm A preliminary point for the moral evaluation of such technical procedures is constituted by the consideration of the circumstances and consequences which those procedures involve in relation to the respect due the human embryo Development of the practice of in vitro fertilization has required innumerable fertilizations and destructions of human embryos Even today the usual practice presupposes a hyperovulation on the part of the woman a number of ova are withdrawn fertilized and then cultivated in vitro for some days Usually not all are transferred into the genital tracts of the woman some embryos generally called spare are destroyed or frozen On occasion some of the implanted embryos are sacrificed for various eugenic economic or psychological reasons Such deliberate destruction of human beings or their utilization for different purposes to the detriment of their integrity and life is contrary to the doctrine on procured abortion already recalled The connection between in vitro fertilization and the voluntary destruction of human embryos occurs too often This is significant through these procedures with apparently contrary purposes life and death are subjected to the decision of man who thus sets himself up as the giver of life and death by decree This dynamic of violence and domination may remain unnoticed by those very individuals who in wishing to utilize this procedure become subject to it themselves The facts recorded and the cold logic which links them must be taken into consideration for a moral judgment on IVF and ET in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer the abortionmentality which has made this procedure possible thus leads whether one wants it or not to mans domination over the life and death of his fellow human beings and can lead to a system of radical eugenics Nevertheless such abuses do not exempt one from a further and thorough ethical study of the techniques of artificial procreation considered in themselves abstracting as far as possible from the destruction of embryos produced in vitro The present Instruction will therefore take into consideration in the first place the problems posed by heterologous artificial fertilization II 13  and subsequently those linked with homologous artificial fertilization II 46  Before formulating an ethical judgment on each of these procedures the principles and values which determine the moral evaluation of each of them will be considered A HETEROLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZATION 1 Why must human procreation take place in marriage Every human being is always to be accepted as a gift and blessing of God However from the moral point of view a truly responsible procreation visavis the unborn child must be the fruit of marriage For human procreation has specific characteristics by virtue of the personal dignity of the parents and of the children the procreation of a new person whereby the man and the woman collaborate with the power of the Creator must be the fruit and the sign of the mutual selfgiving of the spouses of their love and of their fidelity [ 34 ] The fidelity of the spouses in the unity of marriage involves reciprocal respect of their right to become a father and a mother only through each other The child has the right to be conceived carried in the womb brought into the world and brought up within marriage it is through the secure and recognized relationship to his own parents that the child can discover his own identity and achieve his own proper human development The parents find in their child a confirmation and completion of their reciprocal selfgiving the child is the living image of their love the permanent sign of their conjugal union the living and indissoluble concrete expression of their paternity and maternity [ 35 ] By reason of the vocation and social responsibilities of the person the good of the children and of the parents contributes to the good of civil society the vitality and stability of society require that children come into the world within a family and that the family be firmly based on marriage The tradition of the Church and anthropological reflection recognize in marriage and in its indissoluble unity the only setting worthy of truly responsible procreation 2 Does heterologous artifical fertilization conform to the dignity of the couple and to the truth of marriage Through IVF and ET and heterologous artificial insemination human conception is achieved through the fusion of gametes of at least one donor other than the spouses who are united in marriage Heterologous artificial fertilization is contrary to the unity of marriage to the dignity of the spouses to the vocation proper to parents and to the childs right to be conceived and brought into the world in marriage and from marriage [ 36 ] Respect for the unity of marriage and for conjugal fidelity demands that the child be conceived in mariage the bond existing between husband and wife accords the spouses in an objective and inalienable manner the exclusive right to become father and mother solely through each other [ 37 ] Recourse to the gametes of a third person in order to have sperm or ovum available constitutes a violation of the reciprocal commitment of the spouses and a grave lack in regard to that essential property of marriage which is its unity Heterologous artificial fertilization violates the rights of the child it deprives him of his filial relationship with his parental origins and can hinder the maturing of his personal identity Furthermore it offends the common vocation of the spouses who are called to fatherhood and motherhood it objectively deprives conjugal fruitfulness of its unity and integrity it brings about and manifests a rupture between genetic parenthood gestational parenthood and responsibility for upbringing Such damage to the personal relationships within the family has repercussions on civil society what threatens the unity and stability of the family is a source of dissension disorder and injustice in the whole of social life These reasons lead to a negative moral judgment concerning heterologous artifical fertilization consequently fertilization of a married woman with the sperm of a donor different from her husband and fertilization with the husbands sperm of an ovum not coming from his wife are morally illicit Furthermore the artificial fertilization of a woman who is unmarried or a widow whoever the donor may be cannot be morally justified The desire to have a child and the love between spouses who long to obviate a sterility which cannot be overcome in any other way constitute understandable motivations but subjectively good intentions do not render heterologous artificial fertilization conformable to the objective and inalienable properties of marriage or respectful of the rights of the child and of the spouses 3 Is surrogate  motherhood morally licit No for the same reasons which lead one to regect heterologous artificial fertilization for it is contrary to the unity of marriage and to the dignity of the procreation of the human person Surrogate motherhood represents an objective failure to meet the obligations of maternal love of conjugal fidelity and of responsible motherhood it offends the dignity and the right of the child to be conceived carried in the womb brought into the world and brought up by his own parents it sets up to the detriment of families a division between the physical psychological and moral elements which constitute those families B HOMOLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZATION Since heterologous artificial fertilization has been declared unacceptable the question arises of how to evaluate morally the process of homologous artificial fertilization IVF and ET and artificial insemination between husband and wife First a question of principle must be clarified 4 What connection is required from the moral point of view between procreation and the conjugal act a The Churchs teaching on marriage and human procreation affirms the inseparable connection willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his own initiative between the two meanings of the conjugal act the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning Indeed by its intimate structure the conjugal act while most closely uniting husband and wife capacitates them for the generation of new lives according to laws inscribed in the very being of man and of woman [ 38 ] This principle which is based upon the nature of marriage and the intimate connection of the goods of marriage has wellknown consequences on the level of responsible fatherhood and motherhood By safeguarding both these essential aspects the unitive and the procreative the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true mutual love and its ordination towards mans exalted vocation to parenthood [ 39 ] The same doctrine concerning the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and between the goods of marriage throws light on the moral problem of homologous artificial fertilization since it is never permitted to separate these different aspects to such a degree as positively to exclude either the procreative intention or the conjugal relation [ 40 ] Contraception deliberately deprives the conjugal act of its openness to procreation and in this way brings about a voluntary dissociation of the ends of marriage Homologous artificial fertilization in seeking a procreation which is not the fruit of a specific act of conjugal union objectively effects an analogous separation between the goods and the meanings of marriage Thus fertilization is licitly sought when it is the result of a conjugal act which is per se suitable for the generation of children to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh [ 41 ] But from the moral point of view procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not desired as the fruit of the conjugal act that is to say of the specific act of the spouses union b The moral value of the intimate link between the goods of marriage and between the meanings of the conjugal act is based upon the unity of the human being a unity involving body and spiritual soul [ 42 ] Spouses mutually express their personal love in the language of the body which clearly involves both sponsal meanings and parental ones [ 43 ] The conjugal act by which the couple mutually express their selfgift at the same time expresses openness to the gift of life It is an act that is inseparably corporal and spiritual It is in their bodies and through their bodies that the spouses consummate their marriage and are able to become father and mother In order to respect the language of their bodies and their natural generosity the conjugal union must take place with respect for its openness to procreation and the procreation of a person must be the fruit and the result of married love The origin of the human being thus follows from a procreation that is linked to the union not only biological but also spiritual of the parents made one by the bond of marriage [ 44 ] Fertilization achieved outside the bodies of the couple remains by this very fact deprived of the meanings and the values which are expressed in the language of the body and in the union of human persons c Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person In his unique and irrepeatable origin the child must be respected and recognized as equal in personal dignity to those who give him life The human person must be accepted in his parents act of union and love the generation of a child must therefore be the fruit of that mutual giving [ 45 ] which is realized in the conjugal act wherein the spouses cooperate as servants and not as masters in the work of the Creator who is Love [ 46 ] In reality the origin of a human person is the result of an act of giving The one conceived must be the fruit of his parents love He cannot be desired or conceived as the product of an intervention of medical or biological techniques that would be equivalent to reducing him to an object of scientific technology No one may subject the coming of a child into the world to conditions of technical efficiency which are to be evaluated according to standards of control and dominion The moral relevance of the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and between the goods of marriage as well as the unity of the human being and the dignity of his origin demand that the procreation of a human person be brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act specific to the love between spouses The link between procreation and the conjugal act is thus shown to be of great importance on the anthropological and moral planes and it throws light on the positions of the Magisterium with regard to homologous artificial fertilization 5 Is Homologous in Vitro Fertilization Morally Licit The answer to this question is strictly dependent on the principles just mentioned Certainly one cannot ignore the legitimate aspirations of sterile couples For some recourse to homologous IVF and ET appears to be the only way of fulfilling their sincere desire for a child The question is asked whether the totality of conjugal life in such situations is not sufficient to insure the dignity proper to human procreation It is acknowledged that IVF and ET certainly cannot supply for the absence of sexual relations [ 47 ] and cannot be preferred to the specific acts of conjugal union given the risks involved for the child and the difficulties of the procedure But it is asked whether when there is no other way of overcoming the sterility which is a source of suffering homologous in vitro fertilization may not constitute an aid if not a form of therapy whereby its moral licitness could be admitted The desire for a child  or at the very least an openness to the transmission of life  is a necessary prerequisite from the moral point of view for responsible human procreation But this good intention is not sufficient for making a positive moral evaluation of in vitro fertilization between spouses The process of IVF and ET must be judged in itself and cannot borrow its definitive moral quality from the totality of conjugal life of which it becomes part nor from the conjugal acts which may precede or follow it [ 48 ] It has already been recalled that in the circumstances in which it is regularly practiced IVF and ET involves the destruction of human beings which is something contrary to the doctrine on the illicitness of abortion previously mentioned [ 49 ] But even in a situation in which every precaution were taken to avoid the death of human embryos homologous IVF and ET dissociates from the conjugal act the actions which are directed to human fertilization For this reason the very nature of homologous IVF and ET also must be taken into account even abstracting from the link with procured abortion Homologous IVF and ET is brought about outside the bodies of the couple through actions of third parties whose competence and technical activity determine the success of the procedure Such fertilization entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children Conception in vitro is the result of the technical action which presides over fertilization Such fertilization is neither in fact achieved nor positively willed as the expression and fruit of specific act of the conjugal union In homologous IVF and ET therefore even if it is considered in the context of de facto existing sexual relations the generation of the human person is objectively deprived of its proper perfection namely that of being the result and fruit of a conjugal act in which the spouses can become cooperators with God for giving life to a new person [ 50 ] These reasons enable us to understand why the act of conjugal love is considered in the teaching of the Church as the only setting worthy of human procreation For the same reasons the socalled simple case ie a homologous IVF and ET procedure that is free of any compromise with the abortive practice of destroying embryos and with masturbation remains a technique which is morally illicit because it deprives human procreation of the dignity which is proper and connatural to it Certainly homologous IVF and ET fertilization is not marked by all that ethical negativity found in extraconjugal procreation the family and marriage continue to constitute the setting for the birth and upbringing of the children Neverthess in conformity with the traditional doctrine relating to the goods of marriage and the dignity of the person the Church remain opposed from the moral point of view to homologous in vitro fertilization Such fertilization is in itself illicit and in opposition to the dignity of procreation and of the conjugal union even when everything is done to avoid the death of the human embryo Although the manner in which human conception is achieved with IVF and ET cannot be approved every child which comes into the world must in any case be accepted as a living gift of the divine Goodness and must be brought up with love 6 How Is Homologous Artifical Insemination to Be Evaluated From the Moral Point of View Homologous artificial insemination within marriage cannot be admitted except for those cases in which the technical means is not a substitute for the conjugal act but serves to facilitate and to help so that the act attains its natural purpose The teaching of the Magisterium on this point has already been stated [ 51 ] This teaching is not just an expression of particular historical circumstances but is based on the Churchs doctrine concerning the connection between the conjugal union and procreation and on a consideration of the personal nature of the conjugal act and of a human procreation In its natural structure the conjugal act is a personal action a simultaneous and immediate cooperation on the part of the husband and wife which by the very nature of the agents and the proper nature of the act is the expression of the mutual gift which according to the words of Scripture brings about union in one flesh  [ 52 ] Thus moral conscience does not necessarily proscribe the use of certain artificial means destined solely either to the facilitating of the natural act or to insuring that the natural act normally performed achieves its proper end [ 53 ] If the technical means facilitates the conjugal act or helps it to reach its natural objectives it can be morally acceptable If on the other hand the procedure were to replace the conjugal act it is morally illicit Artificial insemination as a substitute for the conjugal act is prohibited by reason of the voluntarily achieved dissociation of the two meanings of the conjugal act Masturbation through which the sperm is normally obtained is another sign of this dissociation even when it is done for the purpose of procreation the act remains deprived of its unitive meaning It lacks the sexual relationship called for by the moral order namely the relationship which realizes the full sense of mutual selfgiving and human procreation in the context of true love  [ 54 ] 7 What Moral Criterion Can Be Proposed With Regard to Medical Intervention in Human Procreation The medical act must be evaluated not only with reference to its technical dimension but also and above all in relation to its goal which is the good of persons and their bodily and psychological health The moral criteria for medical intervention in procreation are deduced from the dignity of human persons of their sexuality and of their origin Medicine which seeks to be ordered to the integral good of the person must respect the specifically human values of sexuality [ 55 ] The doctor is at the service of persons and of human procreation He does not have the authority to dispose of them or to decide their fate A medical intervention respects the dignity of persons when it seeks to assist the conjugal act either in order to facilitate its performance or in order to enable it to achieve its objective once it has been normally performed [ 56 ] On the other hand it sometimes happens that a medical procedure technologically replaces the conjugal act in order to obtain a procreation which is neither its result nor its fruit In this case the medical act is not as it should be at the service of conjugal union but rather appropriates to itself the procreative function and thus contradicts the dignity and the inalienable rights of the spouses and of the child to be born The humanization of medicine which is insisted upon today by everyone requires respect for the integral dignity of the human person first of all in the act and at the moment in which the spouses transmit life to a new person It is only logical therefore to address an urgent appeal to Catholic doctors and scientists that they bear exemplary witness to the respect due to the human embryo and to the dignity of procreation The medical and nursing staff of Catholic hospitals and clinics are in a special way urged to do justice to the moral obligations which they have assumed frequently also as part of their contract Those who are in charge of Catholic hospitals and clinics and who are often Religious will take special care to safeguard and promote a diligent observance of the moral norms recalled in the present Instruction 8 The Suffering Caused By Infertility in Marriage The suffering of spouses who cannot have children or who are afraid of bringing a handicapped child into the world is a suffering that everyone must understand and properly evaluate On the part of the spouses the desire for a child is natural it expresses the vocation to fatherhood and motherhood inscribed in conjugal love This desire can be even stronger if the couple is affected by sterility which appears incurable Nevertheless marriage does not confer upon the spouses the right to have a child but only the right to perform those natural acts which are per se ordered to procreation [ 57 ] A true and proper right to a child would be contrary to the childs dignity and nature The child is not an object to which one has a right nor can he be considered as an object of ownership rather a child is a gift the supreme gift [ 58 ] and the most gratuitous gift of marriage and is a living testimony of the mutual giving of his parents For this reason the child has the right as already mentioned to be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents and he also has the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his conception Nevertheless whatever its cause or prognosis sterility is certainly a difficult trial The community of believers is called to shed light upon and support the suffering of those who are unable to fulfill their legitimate aspiration to motherhood and fatherhood Spouses who find themselves in this sad situation are called to find in it an opportunity for sharing in a particular way in the Lords Cross the source of spiritual fruitfulness Sterile couples must not forget that even when procreation is not possible conjugal life does not for this reason lose its value Physical sterility in fact can be for spouses the occasion for other important services to the life of the human person for example adoption various forms of educational work and assistance to other families and to poor or handicapped children [ 59 ] Many researchers are engaged in the fight against sterility While fully safeguarding the dignity of human procreation some have achieved results which previously seemed unattainable Scientists therefore are to be encouraged to continue their research with the aim of preventing the causes of sterility and of being able to remedy them so that sterile couples will be able to procreate in full respect for their own personal dignity and that of the child to be born  By the term heterologous artificial fertilization or procreation the Instruction means techniques used to obtain a human conception artificially by the use of gametes coming from at least one donor other than the spouses who are joined in marriage Such techniques can be of two types a Heterologous IVF and ET the technique used to obtain a human conception through the meeting in vitro of gametes taken from at least one donor other than the two spouses joined in marriage b heterologous artificial insemination the technique used to obtain a human conception through the transfer into the genital tracts of the woman of the sperm previously collected from a donor other than the husband  By artificial homologous fertilization or procreation the Instruction means the technique used to obtain a human conception using the gametes of the two spouses joined in marriage Homologous artificial fertilization can be carried out by two different methods a Homologous IVF and ET the technique used to obtain a human conception through the meeting in vitro of the gametes of the spouses joined in marriage b Homologous artificial insemination the technique used to obtain a human conception through the transfer into the genital tracts of a married woman of the sperm previously collected from her husband  By surrogate mother the Instruction means a the woman who carries in pregnancy an embryo implanted in her uterus and who is genetically a stranger to the embryo because it has been obtained through the union of the gametes of donors She carries the pregnancy with a pledge to surrender the baby once it is born to the party who commissioned or made the agreement for the pregnancy b the woman who carries in pregnancy an embryo to whose procreation she has contributed the donation of her own ovum fertilized through insemination with the sperm of a man other than her husband She carries the pregnancy with a pledge to surrender the child once it is born to the party who commissioned or made the agreement for the pregnancy
THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE  TEXT OF VATICAN'S DOCTRINAL STATEMENT ON HUMAN REPRODUCTION; PART III: MORAL AND CIVIL LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/vatican-birth-science-text-vatican-s-doctrinal-statement-human-reproduction-part-372187.html,Following is the text a Vatican doctrinal statement Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation Replies to Certain Questions of the Day issued yesterday THE VALUES AND MORAL OBLIGATIONS THAT CIVIL LEGISLATION MUST RESPECT AND SANCTION IN THIS MATTER The inviolable right to life of every innocent human individual and the rights of the family and of the institution of marriage constitute fundamental moral values because they concern the natural condition and integral vocation of the human person at the same time they are constitutive elements of civil society and its order For this reason the new technological possibilities which have opened up in the field of biomedicine require the intervention of the political authorities and of the legislator since an uncontrolled application of such techniques could lead to unforeseeable and damaging consequences for civil society Recourse to the conscience of each individual and to the selfregulation of researchers cannot be sufficient for insuring respect for personal rights and public order If the legislator responsible for the common good were not watchful he could be deprived of his prerogatives by researchers claiming to govern humanity in the name of the biological discoveries and the alleged improvement processes which they would draw from those discoveries Eugenism and forms of discrimination between human beings could come to be legitimized this would constitute an act of violence of and serious offense to the equality dignity and fundamental rights of the human person The intervention of the public authority must be inspired by the rational principles which regulate the relationships between civil law and moral law The task of the civil law is to insure the common good of people through the recognition of and the defense of fundamental rights and through the promotion of peace and of public morality [ 60 ] In no sphere of life can the civil law take the place of conscience or dictate norms concerning things which are outside its competence It must sometimes tolerate for the sake of public order things which it cannot forbid without a greater evil resulting However the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state they pertain to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his of her origin Among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard a every human beings right to life and physical integrity from the moment of conception until death b the rights of the family and of marriage as an institution and in this area the childs right to be conceived brought into the world and brought up by his parents To each of these two themes it is necessary here to give some further consideration In various states certain laws have authorized the direct suppression of innocents the moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation must accord them the state is denying the equality of all before the law When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen and in particular of the more vulnerable the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined The political authority consequently cannot give approval to the calling of human beings into existence through procedures which would expose them to those very grave risks noted previously The possible recognition by positive law and the political authorities of techniques of artificial transmission of life and the experimentation connected with it would widen the breach already opened by the legalization of abortion As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be insured for the unborn child from the moment of his conception the law must provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the childs rights The law cannot tolerate  indeed it must expressly forbid  that human beings even at the embryonic stage should be treated as objects of experimentation be mutilated or destroyed with the excuse that they are superfluous or incapable of developing normally The political authority is bound to guarantee to the institution of the family upon which society is based the juridical protection to which it has a right From the very fact that it is at the service of people the political authority must also be at the service of the family Civil law cannot grant approval to techniques of artificial procreation which for the benefit of third parties doctors biologists economic or governmental powers take away what is a right inherent in the relationship between spouses and therefore civil law cannot legalize the donation of gametes between persons who are not legitimately united in marriage Legislation must also prohibit by virtue of the support which is due to the family embryo banks post mortem insemination and surrogate motherhood It is part of the duty of the public authority to insure that the civil law is regulated according to the fundamental norms of the moral law in matters concerning human rights human life and the institution of the family Politicians must commit themselves through their interventions upon public opinion to securing in society the widest possible consensus on such essential points and to consolidating this consensus wherever it risks being weakened or is in danger of collapse In many countries the legalization of abortion and juridical tolerance of unmarried couples makes it more difficult to secure respect for the fundamental rights recalled by this Instruction It is to be hoped that states will not become responsible for aggravating these socially damaging situations of injustice It is rather to be hoped that nations and states will realize all the cultural ideological and political implications connected with the techniques of artificial procreation and will find the wisdom and courage necessary for issuing laws which are more just and more respectful of human life and the institution of the family The civil legislation of many states confers an undue legitimation upon certain practices in the eyes of many today it is seen to be incapable of guaranteeing that morality which is in conformity with the natural exigencies of the human person and with the unwritten laws etched by the Creator upon the human heart All men of good will must commit themselves particularly within their professional field and in the exercise of their civil rights to insuring the reform of morally unacceptable civil laws and the correction of illicit practices In addition conscientious objection visavis such laws must be supported and recognized A movement of passive resistance to the legitimation of practices contrary to human life and dignity is beginning to make an ever sharper impression upon the moral conscience of many especially among specialists in the biomedical sciences
"THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE;
REPRODUCTIVE HELP: WIDESPREAD AND UNREGULATED",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/the-vatican-on-birth-science-reproductive-help-widespread-and.html,LEAD The reproductive technologies condemned by the Roman Catholic Church yesterday have spread widely as accepted medical practice in the United States approved by many ethics committees and largely unregulated by the Government The reproductive technologies condemned by the Roman Catholic Church yesterday have spread widely as accepted medical practice in the United States approved by many ethics committees and largely unregulated by the Government Although surrogate motherhood in which a woman bears a child for another couple has drawn the most attention in recent months it is far from the most common of the practices discussed by the Vatican Other procedures both old and new have become routine treatment for couples with difficulty having children Tens of thousands of babies each year for example are conceived through the artificial insemination of women with sperm either from their husbands or from donors a procedure that has existed for a century Even more widespread are tests meant to discover genetic abnormalities in fetuses still in the womb Newer technologies however are transforming the options available to infertile men and women Doctors can use needles to draw eggs from a womans body and even to extract sperm from a man who cannot ejaculate normally and the ability to manipulate sperm and eggs in the laboratory has created opportunities for both treatment and researchTechnology Spreading Fast  The need for the technologies is vast Dr Zev Rosenwaks clinical director of the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk Va said yesterday Its spreading extremely rapidly and its almost too early to predict its utility and scope In the process of in vitro fertilization doctors combine eggs with sperm outside the body and then implant the embryos in the womb A fastgrowing number of centers now freeze the embryos for later use In even more advanced procedures the eggs and sperm are reinserted together so that fertilization can occur in the womans reproductive system These technologies manipulate embryos that consist of one or a few cells and they raise serious ethical questions for those that  like the Roman Catholic Church  consider an embryo at that stage to have the full identity and rights of a human being Fertility specialists and medical authorities said yesterday that they expected the whole range of reproductive technologies to continue spreading rapidly But they also said that even before the Vaticans declaration the influence of the Catholic Church and other groups had succeeded in slowing the spread of some technologies and the development of research meant to improve them 4000 In Vitro Births In some cases protests or lawsuits have delayed the opening of centers specializing in in vitro fertilization The United States now has more than 150 such centers and they have produced about 4000 births half of them in the last year As part of their programs in vitro fertilization centers are hastening to give couples the option of freezing embryos when the procedure produces extras Without this technology some centers have disposed of embryos but others have insisted on implanting in the womb all embryos that develop even when that raises the potential danger of multiple pregnancy A variety of ethics committees have debated the questions raised by these technologies in recent years and have supported the most common procedures Apart from this statement by the church I think most people feel there are no ethical issues in in vitro fertilization for a married couple that desperately wants to have a child said Dr Kenneth Ryan head of the committee of ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Furthermore the official Roman Catholic position on such matters often has relatively little to do with what people practice in certain countries he said These are areas that are very personal very private and very important to peopleResearch on Embryos Debated  A more sensitive subject has been the issue of whether scientists should conduct research on embryos produced by in vitro fertilization For more than a decade the Federal Government has forbidden its agencies to finance such research or to allow it at facilities that receive Federal financing for other purposes As a result fertility experts complain that most useful research now comes from abroad Some in vitro fertilization centers acknowledge that they conduct some research on embryos If so a Federal official said yesterday ethically they would be taking very great risks because this issue has not been debated sufficiently in our society The American Fertility Society proposed guidelines last year matching the conclusions of a longdebated report in Britain the socalled Warnock report which endorsed research on embryos as long as they are destroyed within 14 days after fertilization Genetic testing of fetuses before birth has also become a firm part of modern medicine Standard obstetrical practice recommends such tests for women older than 35 by one Government estimate 25 to 30 percent of pregnant women over 35 use themDanger in Prenatal Testing  The best known is amniocentesis in which a sample of fluid is drawn through a needle from the uterus Usually the purpose is to allow a woman the chance to abort a pregnancy when a serious abnormality is discovered The test puts even a healthy fetus at some extra risk of miscarriage Prenatal testing is another area that is changing rapidly Tests have been devised for a greater variety of conditions at earlier states of gestation raising the prospect of more screening that could result in abortions On the other hand physicians have also begun to develop ways of treating certain conditions while a fetus is still in the womb Neither the law nor ethical traditions have anticipated the consequences of the new reproductive technologies  even technologies as old as artificial insemination Some bitter lawsuits have arisen A battle broke out over the estate of a Los Angeles couple who died in a plane crash when an Australian center had two of their frozen embryos And a French woman successfully sued a sperm bank and forced it to give her sperm left by her late husband The Catholic Church called on the civil authorities yesterday to outlaw most of the new technologies but so far legislators have been reluctant to intervene Theyve pretty well stayed out of it said Joyce Seitz of the American Fertility Society which is good and bad I guess
THE VATICAN'S DOCTRINE; VATICAN'S MORAL MISSION  Reproduction Report Seen as Opportunity To Influence Government in Making Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/world/vatican-s-doctrine-vatican-s-moral-mission-reproduction-report-seen-opportunity.html,The Vaticans document on human reproduction exploits what some church officials consider an unparalleled opportunity to influence governments before they enact laws on controversial medical innovations Roman Catholic leaders are acutely aware that many nations have ignored church condemnations of abortion and divorce but Vatican officials are optimistic that some legislatures will eventually take actions demanded in the document issued Tuesday like a prohibition on genetic experimentation with living embryos The document recognizes that the ethical questions are diverse and complex and require long study The Vatican is not expecting quick action in world capitals It does believe however that many people want the science of the body to be governed by moral norms particularly in countries like the United States where technology is moving most quickly The first sentence of the document says a variety of doctors and scientists as well as bishops and other churchmen have asked the Vatican to express a moral judgment on newly developed techniques to manipulate procreation like testtube fertilization Many of these requests came from nonCatholics That fact along with a reading of events around the world convinced Pope John Paul II that a void exisited in mans moral code because science was repeatedly posing previously unkown problems Early in the 1980s the Pope decided the church had to respond according to Vatican officials After almost two years of drafting that response came Tuesday entitled Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Orgins and on the Dignity of Procreation Replies to Certain Questions of the Day The document contains significant developments in the churchs views in at least two areas the relationship between civil and moral law and the challenge of managing modern science In treating these themes the document provides the most complete expression to date of ideas that have preoccupied John Paul II throughout his pontificate It is also one of the most prescriptive documents recently produced by the Vatican in that it not only lays down moral judgments but also calls on governments to take specific actions like prohibiting surrogate motherhood and the creation of embryo banks This is something new in the history of mankind Joaquin NavarroValls the chief Vatican spokesman said People around the world are trying to determine the ethical implications of these developments but so far no government has enacted laws on the subject Rare Chance to Influence Laws The church he added saw a rare chance to try to influence laws that have not been published yet To this end the document offers governments moral principles which can be the basis for new laws and it makes suggestions that are much more specific than is usually the case with Vatican statements he said Defining the churchs role in the political arena has been a longstanding concern for the Pope He has for instance aggressively disciplined priests who took appointed or elected government jobs Political governing is a role he insists must be left to laymen This documents argues as the Pope has often argued before that civil laws must reflect moral laws and that the church has a duty and a special competence to illuminate moral laws Goes a Step Further But the document goes a step further and defines the type of behavior expected of politicians and other laymen After stating that civil laws must respect moral norms concerning human rights human life and the insitution of the family the document says Politicians must commit themselves through their interventions upon public opinion to securing in society the widest possible consensus on such essential points and to consolidating this consensus wherever it risks being weakened or is in danger of collapse That statement the first of its kind in a Vatican proclamation could prove relevant to debates that have arisen between Catholic bishops and Catholic politicians over abortion laws Such debate is likely to be revived on the issues treated by the document It also addresses the responsibility of laymen outside government who are faced with civil laws that legitimize what the church considers immoral practices It says all men of good will must commit themselves to changing these laws adding that conscientious objection to such laws must be supported and recognized Praise of Abortion Foes Apparently in praise of antiabortion advocates the document says A movement of passive resistence to the legitimation of practices contrary to human life and dignity is begining to make an ever sharper impression upon the moral conscience of many especially among specialists in the biomedical sciences The Vatican certainly expects that the considerable resources the church has mustered to fight abortion will be sent into battle on the new biomedical issues But the document indicates that the Vatican expects these new issues will provoke a far greater response than legalized abortion has because it says the new technologies potentially threaten all mankind John Paul has repeatedly stated that church feels no hostility toward science that it clearly sees the benefits of science and that it wants to help insure that scientific activity is moral and to the benefit of man Several Vatican officials have said privately that there has been grave concern that this document could undo the Popes effort to reach an accommodation between science and religion if it is viewed as another Galileo case referring to the Vaticans persecution of the 17thcentury Italian astronomer Stark Vision of Danger A stark vision of the dangers posed by modern science seems to have overshadowed worries that the church might be rejecting advances that could be of great value just as it did when the Inquisition tried Galileo For the first time in an official statement the Vatican argued that it would be illusory to claim that scientific research and its applications are morally neutral It goes on to speak repeatedly of an active and growing threat from science that if uncontrolled will lead to mans ruin The broad warning is most often posed in terms of hypothetical developments rather than existing practices especially in the realm of genetic manipulation It raises for example the specter of researchers claiming to govern humanity in the name of biological discovery and thus the revival of eugenism the effort to improve the quality of offspring as was practiced by Nazis in search of the master race Battle of the Rear Guard The Vatican does not feel it is alone in expressing these concerns The battle for the autonomy of science is a battle of the rear guard Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger said at a news conference Tuesday Cardinal Ratzinger who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith the Vatican office that wrote the document added Science is not an absolute to which all things have to be subordinated and eventually sacrificed even the dignity of man He said the ecology movement and the growing opposition to nuclear energy showed that science now faced widespread demands that it subject itself to moral norms When it tried to supress Galileos astronomy the church found itself battling an unstoppable historical tide Now the Vatican sees itself going into a long and difficult fight for legislation to safeguard human procreation and it seems to feel that this time history is on its side
THE VATICAN'S DOCTRINE: WORLD REACTION; VIEWS OF THE VATICAN DOCUMENT VARY FROM APPROVAL TO VOWED RESISTANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/world/vatican-s-doctrine-world-reaction-views-vatican-document-vary-approval-vowed.html,The Vaticans new document on human reproduction prompted reactions around the world yesterday that ranged from approval from the hierarchy in Brazil the worlds largest Catholic country to at least one vow of resistance in Ireland and consternation in the Catholic hospital that performed Frances first artificial fertilization The Brazilian National Bishops Conference  the worlds largest such group outside Italy with 357 bishops praised the Vatican document which condemned testtube fertilization and called for laws prohibiting practices such as the use of surrogate mothers and experimentation on living embryos saying its release came at an opportune time because Brazil is about to prepare a new constitution It may serve as guideline to the constituent assembly said the conference spokesman the Rev Arnaldo Beltrani The church will send copies of the Vatican text to all assembly members he said Document Not FrontPage News Although the church in Brazil has a reputation for independence on political and social issues it is conservative on questions such as abortion and family planning In Ireland the head of an invitro fertilization clinic in county Kildare said the program would continue unless the Irish Government banned it The Government in that predominantly Roman Catholic country had no comment Dr Tony Walsh head of the program at Clane Hospital in Kildare said he did not think the doctrinal statement from the Vatican would affect the program Nor he said did he expect it to stop inquiries from couples seeking medical help to achieve reproduction At St James Hospital in Dublin which pioneered invitro and gamete intraFallopian programs in Ireland an administrator Liam Dunbar said some staff members might withdraw their services in the face of the Vatican ruling In Spain some theologians expressed dismay that the Vatican did not align its policies with what they said were the social and technological realities of the 20th century But many were not surprised by the Vatican position Spanish newspapers gave wide coverage to the document and the presentation in Madrid of a Spanish version by Msgr Antonio Palenzuela Two newspapers that usually oppose the Vatican on social issues El Pais and Diario 16 carried news stories but no editorials No Particular Consequences In Italy where portions of the Vatican document were leaked to newspapers before it was made public Prof Emanuele Lauricella president of CECOS Italia the Italian association that represents the majority of private centers that practice artificial insemination said I dont believe that the position of the church will have any practical consequences When a Christian couple wants a child at all costs he said they already know what must be done The president of the Italian Association for Demographic Education Prof Luigi Laratta said the document shocks not so much because it goes in an opposite direction to the development of science but because it lacks humanity The associations statistics indicate that about 70 percent of artificial inseminations involve Catholic women and that in more than 75 percent of all artificial inseminations the donor is not the spouse The Communist daily LUnitas writer on Vatican affairs Alceste Santini referring to the portion of the document that invites all men of good will to work toward changing legislation on the subject deplored the Vaticans interference in the autonomous responsibilities of nations In France medical and scientific leaders generally dissented sharply from parts of the Vatican document Public reaction was muted and many observers suggested that the effect of the document on individual behavior would be limited I think that in most cases the Vatican will have no influence because sterile women who want in vitro fertilization are usually highly motivated said Prof JeanBernard Dubuisson who is in charge of in vitro fertilization at the Port Royale Maternity Hospital in Paris Surprised by Vatican Document The Vatican ruling was reported to have caused consternation at the Catholic Medical Faculty attached to the StPhillibert Hospital at Lille which conducted the first invitro fertilization in France last September That procedure led to the birth of a girl The vice rector of the hospital Abbe Jerome Reginer said he was suprised by the Vaticans document He said that four other in vitro pregnancies are under way Of course there is no question of interfering with them he said The hospital imposed three rules for artifical pregnancies last year Only the husbands sperm and the wifes ovum may be used potential parents must also have a stable married relationship and no experiments involving destruction of embryos are to be performed Expressing satisfaction with the new document the Association of Catholic Doctors and Nurses called on the Lille Hospital to submit to the Popes authority and cease all new experiments with invitro fertilization New Debate Welcomed Frances National Ethics Committee which advises the Government on ethical

The Future of Test-Tube Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/opinion/the-future-of-test-tube-life.html,On the day in 1978 that a little girl named Louise Brown was conceived in a Petri dish in a British laboratory humankind took an enormous step into the future Nine years later there is still no body of law to govern our residence there  nor are we really sure where to look for one The Vatican however knows a source for such laws  in the teachings or Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church  and this week it expanded those teachings with a doctrinal statement It condemns virtually all forms of artificial fertilization and embryo transfer and approves medical interference in procreation only when it assists married couples who engaged in normal intercourse The Vatican also calls for laws prohibiting surrogate motherhood and experimentation on living embryos Some American Roman Catholic theologians have already dissented from parts of Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation Replies to Certain Questions of the Day So will many of the laity to judge by their response to earlier bans on abortion and birth control devices As for nonCatholics their response to the new doctrinal statement might be Whos the Vatican to tell me what to do with my life Yet thoughtful people their consciences engaged by issues like surrogate motherhood can nevertheless welcome Replies to Certain Questions Whether or not they agree with all or much of the doctrinal statement it offers a considered set of views warranting attention as secular society argues out its bioethical views And there are some parts of the statement with which it would be hard for anyone to disagree Thanks to the progress of the biological and medical sciences man has at his disposal ever more effective therapeutic resources but he can also acquire new powers with unforeseeable consequences over human life at its very beginning and in its first stages And the Vatican statement warns It would on the one hand be illusory to claim that scientific research and its applications are morally neutral on the other hand one cannot derive criteria for guidance from mere technical efficiency If one could countless Americans would still be hooked up to life support systems that were in effect simply ventilating dead bodies That they arent is because they their physicians and their families recognized the limits of technical efficiency and asked for legislation that placed lifesaving measures within a broader concept  No state however has yet developed legal criteria concerning surrogate motherhood which involves a very efficient and indeed simple technology As the case of Baby M shows all too clearly such criteria are sorely needed The judge who must decide whether the child will live with her father or with the woman he hired to bear their child will have to do so unaided by statute case law or even settled public policy As for the moral aspects of other issues like influencing chromosomic and genetic inheritance  modern society hasnt even touched them yet Even Americans who disagree with the Vaticans specific replies to such tormenting questions can welcome the stimulus to think through ethical responses of their own Medical technology is running ahead of morality a British doctor said when Louise Brown was born It still is
ON MY MIND; God and Ethic in Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/opinion/on-my-mind-god-and-ethic-in-midtown.html,It was one of those meetings that are very much part of New York  a halfdozen people collected to talk to a hundred others in the middle of the day about something very important but to which there were no real answers This time it was ethics and although nobody really expected clear solutions still a group of busy people had decided to spend a couple of hours talking about American ethical standards and what to do about them instead of going for a walk in the winter sun This time the discussion  they always are called panels  had a special point because it took place at the midtown offices of the American Jewish Committee after awards were handed out for books on Jewish themes Most Jews are aware that they neither invented nor are the sole guardians of ethical standards but still they experience a sense of depression when something goes ethically awry among a group of Jews or in Israel Sometimes it is fearrooted will this encourage antiSemitism but often the sadness comes from some lessening of collective selfimage Jews are not necessarily more ethical than any other group but they feel they are supposed to be So when some among them are so obviously not that tends to make for moroseness a little slipping of mooring The panel was not called to discuss simply Jewish ethics Irangate was in mind and so was acceptance of the homeless as part of the scenery But this group also did worry about so many Jews being involved in the Wall Street scandals and the state of Israel enmeshing an American Jew in espionage against the United States which they took as damaging to themselves Israel and their country That bouncy Socialist Michael Harrington spoke and of course he gave whatfor to the capitalist system He said that one of the ethical problems of this country was that the system was good at enriching paper entrepreneurs but not as good now at increasing the real wealth of the country through production He said that in lecturing to college students he found there was idealism but that they did not know where to put it He was proud that his own son Alexander had shown idealism by chalking up his very first arrest for demonstrating Somebody suggested aloud matchmaking between Alexander and Amy Carter At a table there was a mutter that then they should both go off to Russia and try a little demonstrating against Mr Gorbachev for a change Mr Harrington was enthusiastic about Hegels point that there is no value in individual ethic but that it should come from the community He did not say what kind of ethic that would produce in a Fascist or Communist society but clues may be contained within Hegels The Phenomenology of the Spirit which he recommended to all assembled Mr Harrington is a very peppy talker even about Marx and Hegel The Rev Richard John Neuhaus a Lutheran minister and writer said that what the country needed most was rational deliberation as among a free people on how we ought to order our lives He said that abortion was the most critical ethical issue but when it was raised people said who will decide whats right as if that were the end of the matter instead of the beginning There were a couple of other speakers but everybody was waiting for Elie Wiesel to sum up the discussion Mr Wiesel in addition to winning the Nobel Peace Prize and writing books that may win him another Nobel also teaches Like all good teachers he poses a question that bothers him and winds up bothering the audience In this case how does a human being best put to use for other humans the ideas the experiences the memories of a lifetime Everybody knew that despite his eminence he was not pretending not to know but really did not nobody did Mr Wiesel said that whatever ethic was it was not between God and man but between man and man God can take care of Himself It did not sound at all impious quite the reverse Later in the corridor a noted Rabbi Wolfe Kelman told the tale of the Hasidic mystic who went into a place where harried weary Jewish women were rushing about making matzohs for Passover realized they were overworked and underpaid and refused to give the owner certification that the matzohs were kosher There is blood on your matzohs said the Hasid Rabbi Kelmans point was that you can observe the letter of the religious law and still be a scoundrel Afterward people said that although there were no solutions they had received a lot to turn over in their minds which of course is the point of these meetings in the middle of the day and makes them even better than a brisk wintertime walk
THE VATICAN'S DOCTRINE: RELIGIOUS DEBATE; JEWS AND EVANGELICALS TAKE DIFFERING STANDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/us/vatican-s-doctrine-religious-debate-jews-evangelicals-take-differing-stands.html,No other major religious group in the United States including Protestant evangelicals and Orthodox Jews has adopted an absolute theological stand against intervention in human procreation as outlined in the new Roman Catholic document leading religious thinkers said yesterday Evangelicals and Orthodox Jews generally share the Catholic revulsion against abortion but they allow for a greater degree of flexibility in aiding a couple who are infertile The Vatican document in all cases rejected the use of either artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization in which the egg and sperm are brought together in a laboratory While disagreeing with some of its conclusions evangelicals welcomed the Vatican document for framing in dramatic terms the questions about when human life begins Science ought not necessarily do everything that is theoretically possible said the Rev Carl F H Henry a leading evangelical theologian It tends to run ahead of moral judgment and it does so at great risk An Evil or a Virtue However Dr Moses Tendler who holds the chair in Jewish medical ethics at Yeshiva University drew a distinction between the Jewish and Catholic approaches The word natural is a holy word to the Pope and unnatural means evil Dr Tendler said To us unnatural is a mitzvah meaning a virtuous deed Unnatural is not a sin he said but an opportunity to complete Gods work As a result Dr Tendler said Jewish law endorses artifical insemination of a woman using her husbands sperm as well as in vitro fertilization when the husbands sperm and wifes egg are involved In some cases he added Jewish law would also permit the use of thirdparty donor sperm You cannot commit adultery with a catheter or a hypodermic syringe Dr Tendler said Meanwhile members of the Catholic hierarchy continued to rally around the Vatican document while feminist theologians severely criticized its conclusions Msgr Peter G Finn chief spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York said the Archbishop John Cardinal OConnor fully supports the document and will do all that is in his power to implement and teach the guidelines Monsignor Finn said that the Vatican instruction had been prepared with the help of a committee of bishops from around the world and distributed to all the bishops who have accepted the teaching without opposition However Dr Margaret Farley a Roman Catholic nun who is a professor of Christian Ethics at Yale Divinity School faulted the process by which the document was drawn and its conclusions Dr Farley and other women said the documents drafters had failed to consult parents who are struggling with these issues or women in general The Vaticans blanket conclusions in which virtually any proceative process other than sexual intercourse between husband and wife is termed morally illicit were not justified in terms of the complexity of the questions involved Dr Farley said People making decisions will not take it seriously she said of the document It doesnt offer them the answers they need The church by acting in an authoritarian way loses the kind of moral power regarding these issues Protestant Attitudes Vary Among Protestants there is no single position on the issues raised in the Vatican document Attitudes range from evangelicals who believe that procreation is a sacred act to liberals who see it as a strictly biological matter The debate on these issues among Christians which has continued almost since the beginning of Christianity centers on when the soul enters the body at conception in gestation or at birth A 1986 policy statement on genetics adopted by the National Council of Churches which represents more than 30 Protestant and Orthodox Christian groups explored many of the same medical technologies but arrived at few conclusions about the morality of them The ethicist who drafted the report was Dr J Robert Nelson director of the Institute of Religion at the Texas Medical Center in Houston I think the Vatican has done a real service by forcing the rest of us to clarify our positions on these sensitive issues Dr Nelson said yesterday More Agreement Among Jews There is greater uniformity of view among the different Jewish groups than within Christianity Thinkers in the Orthodox Conservative and Reform branches would agree with Dr Seymour Siegel professor of ethics and theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America who said When nature plays a trick on us we have to outwit it The Jewish branches differ however on the issue of surrogate motherhood While many Conservative and Reform theologians allow its use in certain circumstances the Orthodox forbid the practice Dr Tendler of Yeshiva who is Orthodox said that the Orthodox position stems not from issues of adultery but from the prohibition aginst putting someones life in danger Since a woman giving birth is endangered he reasoned a woman cannot take that risk unless she will have the benefit of producing a child of her own The Protestants closest to the Vatican on reproductive issues are the Fundamentalist Christians The Rev Edward Dobson vice president of Liberty University in Lynchburg Va said We begin with the same moral principles and the same general concerns for the sanctity of life Fundamentalists he said would share the Catholic attitude on surrogate motherhood laboratory fertilization and on thirdparty donors They would disagree however on artificial insemination Most fundamentalist thinkers he said would see no problem in using the technique if husband and wife were involved One Catholic theologian Dr Rosemary Reuther a feminist writer and professor of theology at Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston Ill rejected the entire Vatican document as irrelevant The Pope has made such a blanket statement that it is just irrelevant she said He thinks that whatever is not based on the natural order is immoral How can you live in the 20th century and believe that How can you ride in a car or drive a plane Thats not natural now is it
KOHL IS RE-ELECTED TO A SECOND TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/world/kohl-is-re-elected-to-a-second-term.html,Helmut Kohl was formally reelected Chancellor of West Germany today as his centerright coalition concluded negotiations for a Cabinet and policies to guide the country for the next four years The Premier of Bavaria Franz Josef Strauss a rightwinger decided not to join the new Cabinet which has only two new faces The Christian Democrat reportedly declined the post of Deputy Chancellor and the Ministries of Defense Finance and Interior Mr Strauss 71 years old was widely blamed for contributing to the Christian Democrats poor showing in the election Jan 25 because of his fierce attacks on the liberal Free Democrats the coalitions junior partners Mr Strausss influence over national politics appears to be waning Chancellor Since 1982 Mr Kohl was elected Chancellor for a second fouryear term by a parliamentary vote of 253 to 225 Mr Kohl a 56yearold Christian Democrat became Chancellor in October 1982 when the Free Democratic Party ended its alliance with the leftofcenter Social Democrats toppling the Government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt The only shift of consequence in the new Cabinet was the assignment of a fourth ministry to the Free Democrats in recognition of their strong showing in the January election Jurgen Mollemann who had been a Minister of State in the Foreign Ministry became Education Minister A Bavarian Christian Democratic legislator Hans Klein took charge of the ministry for aid to developing countries and Dorothee Wilms who had been Education Minister was given responsibility for the sensitive ministry that watches over relations with East Germany Before the election Mr Strauss had made little secret of his ambition to supplant Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher the Free Democrats dominant figure who has held his job since 1974 Mr Strauss had served in previous Governments as Defense and Finance Minister Political Attacks Backfire But Mr Strausss electoral broadsides at the Free Democrats  and suggestions by his lieutenants that detente with the Soviet Union was anathema  appeared to have backfired with the voters In the second Kohl Government Mr Genschers influence over West German foreign policy has grown and his principal deputies are now all from his own party One of Mr Genschers most salient initiatives since the election has been to call for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to engage Mikhail S Gorbachev and to take him at his word regarding the democratization of Soviet politics The Foreign Minister has called for increased economic ties with the Soviet Union and moved quickly to stifle opposition within the coalition to Mr Gorbachevs move for an agreement with the United States for the abolition of mediumrange missiles in Europe The ascendancy of Mr Genschers conciliatory line toward the Russians has accompanied a warming in ties between Bonn and Moscow and officials here say they expect a visit later this year from the Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A Shevardnadze Mr Kohl according to German officials will make Soviet relations a central theme of a Government declaration next week At the same time there have been signs of a quickening of ties with East Germany The Christian Democratic Mayor of West Berlin Eberhard Diepgen has invited the East German leader Erich Honecker to visit the western side of Berlin next month when it marks the citys 750th anniversary The invitation was a kind of response to a similar invitation issued to Mr Diepgen by Mr Honecker who in 1961 was in charge of building the Berlin wall Chancellor Kohl has also indicated a readiness to hold discussions with East Germany about mediumrange missiles  a step initiated by Mr Honecker Mounting Economic Concerns The movement on foreign policy issues comes as various economic indicators suggest that West Germanys economic boom is over and that growth in 1987 will be well under the 25 percent forecast by the Government before the election Unemployment is at 248 million or 10 percent of the work force The gloomy economic news precedes elections scheduled for five West German states in the next six months Meanwhile policymaking on many questions appears hostage to electoral expediencies A program of tax cuts for example was agreed to last month without any decision on where expenditures would be cut to offset losses of revenue The tax cuts which will take effect in 1990 fell far short of the kind of bold steps that Washington has urged West Germany to take to stimulate its economy Other measures agreed to in the lengthy coalition negotiations include a mild liberalization of West Germanys stringent storeclosing hours procedures that will make it somewhat more complicated to obtain abortions and agreement on a law that will ease jail sentences for terrorists who cooperate with the state
THE VATICAN'S DOCTRINE: POLITICAL IMPACT; CONTRAST TO ABORTION ISSUE IS DISCERNED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/us/the-vatican-s-doctrine-political-impact-contrast-to-abortion-issue-is-discerned.html,The Vaticans major doctrinal statement condemning a number of reproductive procedures and technologies seems unlikely to provoke as broad a political reaction as its stand against the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion according to several political analysts and specialists The use of surrogate mothers and testtube fertilization two of several issues addressed by the Vatican Tuesday are matters of growing concern to fundamentalist and evangelical Christians But even on those issues some political specialists said they could not see the powerful consensus emerging on the right that grew around the issue of legalized abortion Complex Ethical Questions In promulgating its document the Vatican indicated that it was not expecting quick reactions in world capitals because the statement raised diverse and complex ethical questions requiring long study Of the Vatican document in general Kevin Phillips a Republican strategist said I just dont see how this lends itself to the neat clean dissection that the abortion issue did Richard Viguerie a conservative agreed Its early yet and this is a new wrinkle a new issue he said There are some elements that will feel strongly about it but I think most people are really trying to figure out their positions on this Many Different Parts to This And at least in the near future Mr Viguerie said he does not detect a united front among conservative Christians Its just not something thats had a heavy focus in the political community or the religious right community There are so many different parts to this But the potential is there said Paul Weyrich another conservative leader citing in particular the issues of surrogate mothers and in vitro fertilization There is a general receptivity to be very skeptical about this stuff said Mr Weyrich It really has to do with the sanctity of marriage and what sort of experiments youd allow with human beings Unlike the issue of contraception Mr Weyrich added I would say in due time you would find somewhat of a consensus view on these issues among evangelical and fundmentalist Christians Some analysts and specialists said the document would largely serve to heighten existing political debates I dont really see that it would do anything other than to sharpen the split between liberal and more orthodox Catholics said J P McFadden chairman of the National Committee of Catholic Laymen an orthodox group that publishes The Catholic Eye a newsletter The document one analyst said could also set the stage for further public debates between Roman Catholic candidates and the Church hierarchy as have occurred between Governor Cuomo of New York and John Cardinal OConnor the Archbishop of New York Impact on Catholic Candidates The 1984 election put into focus for Catholic candidates the question of his or her relationship with the Church observed Geoffrey D Garin president of Peter Hart Research Once the question begins to be posed it doesnt go away very quickly The new Vatican document Mr Garin added just adds another reason to ask the question Where do you stand And its a question that nonCatholic candidates dont have to answer at all Another Democratic poll taker Harrison Hickman played down its political impact Certainly voters understand that you can be a faithful person and not follow every request of the Pope Mr Hickman said In Albany Governor Cuomo reserved judgment on the Vatican statement saying that he wanted first to hear the recommendations of a commission that he had set up to study many of the same matters Panel Set Up Earlier by Cuomo I anticipated problems like these two years ago the Governor said in a radio interview and set up a commission to study them and report to us surrogate mothering artificial insemination fertilization in vitro  all of these things are matters properly to be considered by the commission Im sure theyll be taking a look at the Vatican instructions socalled along with all the other materials they have As soon as they have some thoughts on it theyll share them with me and Ill share them with you and the rest of the public The Governor a Catholic declined to talk about his personal opinion of the instructions Ever since taking office in 1983 Mr Cuomo has stressed that the Churchs teachings apply only to his personal life not to his execution of public policy and he vigorously reaffirmed that today Gap in Values and Technology In Washington Gary Bauer President Reagans adviser on domestic policy who was chairman of the Presidents Working Group on the Family said The one thing the Vatican statement does is remind us our technology sometimes moves much faster than our ability to consider the moral implications of it Public policy makers face a real challenge in that regard when it comes to reconciling values and technological advances Campbell Gardett spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department would have no comment on the Vatican statement Representative William E Dannemeyer Republican of California said he would press for hearings on the statement by the Energy and Commerce Committees Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of which he is a member I dont have any problem with a married couple using modern science to enhance the possibility of having a child he said But he added that the Vatican was properly concerned about creating life artificially outside the family structure He also said he was not sure about the morality of surrogate motherhood but that it may be appropriate to consider laws in that area Bruce Babbitt the former Governor of Arizona who announced his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination Tuesday said he viewed the Vatican document as a religious matter rather than a political issue The individual teachings of churches and religious denominations are a matter of personal conscience said Mr Babbitt a Catholic They are appropriate for legislative discussion only when there is general consensus and ethical agreement among Catholic Jew and Protestant Mr Babbitt who supports legalized abortion said he had not read the Vaticans document but his initial reaction was that most of its findings would not command the degree of ethical consensus to bring them into legislative debate Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona a Catholic Democrat who opposes abortion praised the Vatican document but said I dont think itll be as emotional or politically galvanizing an issue as the abortion issue I dont minimize it either Nevertheless many of the documents findings were being viewed as aspects of the abortion issue Douglas Johnson legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee hailed the Vaticans strong opposition to nontherapeutic embryonic experimentation On those points we welcome this document as a very clear affirmation of the intrinsic dignity and worth of the most defenseless members of the human family Mr Johnson said
THE VATICAN DOCTRINE; HOW LAITY WILL BE TAUGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/us/the-vatican-doctrine-how-laity-will-be-taught.html,The teachings of the Vatican document on human reproduction will be disseminated among the nations 52 million Roman Catholics through sermons seminars church bulletins and pastoral letters The United States Catholic Conference has sent copies of the 40page document to all 300 Catholic bishops in the United States The bishops have been encouraged to share the document with Catholics and others in their dioceses and to apply its principles in the nations 600 Catholic hospitals There is no plan at this time to devote a special Sunday for priests to speak about the issue conference officials said In the past special Sundays have been set aside to discuss other matters of broad importance On ProLife Sunday for example all priests are expected to preach against abortion Instead priests are expected to discuss the Vatican document when it seems relevant to the scriptural reading or when questions have been raised in the community Priests will also be instructed to use the document in giving guidance to infertile couples who are considering different medical technologies Catholics who knowingly flaut the guidelines would be guilty of sin To expiate that sin they would have to confess to a priest However couples who used artificial insemination without knowing that it was in violation of the Vatican teaching would not have committed a sin While a couple who willingly ignored the teaching would have sinned under no circumstances would any stigma be attached to a child conceived through such means
SUCCESS IN PREVENTING TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/14/style/success-in-preventing-teen-age-pregnancy.html,Every day more than 3000 teenage girls become pregnant and 1300 babies are born to adolescents Five hundred teenagers have abortions 26 girls age 13 and 14 have their first child and 13 others who are 16 have their second child Over the course of a year one of every 10 teenage girls becomes pregnant Although the numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics seem bleak in fact they represent a decline in the rates of both pregnancy and childbirth among women under 20 According to the center the number of infants  479000  born to teenagers in 1984 dipped below half a million for the first time since 1960 Progress in stemming the tide of teenage pregnancy accounted for the mood of optimism that prevailed at the Childrens Defense Funds threeday conference that concluded here Friday More than 1700 social workers guidance counselors health professionals clergymen educators business and foundation executives researchers and lawmakers met at the Washington Hilton to compare strategies Less Political Flak Speakers included Govs Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts and James R Thompson of Illinois Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Representative Augustus F Hawkins a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee Asked to assess efforts to reduce teenage childbearing Marian Wright Edelman founder and president of the Childrens Defense Fund said We are further along than I expected when we started working on this issue four years ago and there has been less political flak than I expected Adolescent pregnancy is decreasing she said in part because of activism by all kinds of organizations and in part because of increased awareness among public officials of the magnitude of the problem and its effects And she added Dr CEverett Koop the United States Surgeon General may have done more to open up discussion than anyone else AIDS may do for us what one million teenage preganancies couldnt do get us talking about sex she continued It is forcing parents to talk to children People who were tonguetied realize that they must addresss something that is lethal The more volatile questions that surround teenage sexuality  abortion distribution of contraceptives in school clinics and parental rights  were muted at most sessions but discussions about pragmatic approaches and debates about what works best abounded in public forums and informal conversations Governor Thompson a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association Task Force on TeenAge Pregnancy described a fouryearold Illinois program called Parents Too Soon that works both to prevent teenage pregnancies and to assist girls and their families when they do occur Gerard Kitzi director of the Adolescent Resource Corporation in Kansas City Mo described successful efforts to overcome opposition to the establishment of three schoolbased clinics Alvia Branch a research official with PublicPrivate Ventures in Philadelphia described that organizations summerjob and tutoring program for teenagers in five cities The key ingredient to success conference participants overwhelmingly agreed was the ability to weave the topic of adolescent sexuality into the broader context of teenage life not to separate it from education and job preparation or from the family school and church Though it has been evolving over the past few years the comprehensive approach is considered new In some programs dealing with teenagers the topic of pregnancy is an almost imperceptible thread in the larger tapestry of services and activities Certainly that is the case at El Puente a youth center in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn The center financed by government agencies and foundations offers a broad range of medical legal and social services classes athletics and arts We are in the secondpoorest Congressional District in the country and in the poorest Latino neighborhood in the city said the centers founder and chief executive Luis GardenAcosta Everything we know about teen pregnancy tells us that young people who have little selfesteem who cannot envision alternatives for themselves are at risk for irresponsible sexual behavior So it is not a question of knowing how to use a condom it is about knowing that you can do something about your life He cited the case of a young man 18 years old now a regular at the center When he arrived he had been suspended from school He refused to talk at all We gave him a camera and within months he was winning photography awards Now he plans to get his highschool equivalency degree and go on for visual arts He is no longer so interested in investing his machismo in sexual experimentation Of the 65 girls in our art program in the past three years not one has become pregnant he added What approaches do teenagers themselves advocate Some were panel particpants and several addressed the conference at large They were adamant that young people themselves should play a central role in efforts to reduce sexual activity and early childbirth It should be us who talk to other teenagers about contraception said Natividad Ortega 17 a peer counselor at El Puente We can best help each other Give us the information Let us do the talking Trading Impressions of Communities Abby Berman 17 a representative of the Levels program for teenagers in Great Neck LI traded impressions with Ms Ortega We think were so different in Great Neck but were not Ms Berman said If you have money and go to a good school you are expected to be happy and if you are unhappy you think there is something wrong with you There is a lot of pressure to be sexually active Sex begins in the eighth grade and teens turn sex into just another activity Ms Ortega agreed When you hang out with a crowd like that how long can it be before you become involved Asked how she communicated with the teenagers she counsels at El Puente she said I simply make myself available I always say Hello hows school  But subtlety is necessary along with friendliness to break down barriers You cant just tell people to use birth control she said though girls know what can happen if they dont Rather we get into issues of how they feel about themselves of what would happen if they did have a baby
PANEL BACKS FETAL TRANSPLANTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/14/us/panel-backs-fetal-transplants.html,A panel of medical ethical and legal experts has declared support for a procedure that involves transplanting brain tissue from aborted fetuses in an effort to aid people suffering from Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease and other nerve disorders The procedure would allow nerve tissue to be taken from fetal remains and transplanted into the brains of victims of certain neurological disorders Fetal tissue offers specific advantages because it is less likely to be rejected by the body and it tends to grow and differentiate better than other transplanted material said Mary Mahowald codirector of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve Universitys School of Medicine which convened the panel Associations With Abortion The procedure has been demonstrated in studies with rats mice and some primates and those at a December conference agreed that human research might begin soon Were fully aware the issue is going to be clouded by associations with abortion said Ms Mahowald But its important to stress that we are in no way making any comment or taking a stand on the morality or legality of abortion she said The fetal material in question would be taken from dead fetuses that have been legally aborted Ms Mahowald also acknowledged that some people would be put off by the idea of transplanting brain tissue This is comparable to the sentiment expressed years ago when the first heart transplants were performed she said Many people thought the idea of heart transplants was ghoulish but in time they recognized that the procedure could help many people without hurting anyone Some states prohibit the use of fetal tissue acquired from elective abortions but most allow it if the parents give consent she said
SEX AND POLITICS; TOUGH DECISIONS ALONG A NEW ETHICAL FRONTIER,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/weekinreview/sex-and-politics-tough-decisions-along-a-new-ethical-frontier.html,AMERICANS are notoriously skeptical of busybodies and of government telling them what to do The notion that you can do what you want as long as you dont hurt anyone else is etched deeply in the national character and the burden of proof usually falls on those who would meddle But at times in the nations history  and this is one of them  that assumption has broken down Suddenly sex is a very public political issue The country is pondering how the most intimate acts are inextricably social how millions of personal choices affect the common good Matters that many people would prefer to see kept private have thus become part of the public discourse how to use a condom how much to tell children about safe sex how to balance the demands of public health against the rights of individuals to avoid disclosing more than they want to about their sex lives And new issues such as surrogate motherhood dramatized by the Baby M trial have shown how changes in technology and social practice have outrun jurisprudence and legislation In an effort to influence laws on these issues before they are passed the Vatican last week issued a lengthy statement condemning virtually all forms of testtube fertilization the use of surrogate mothers and experimentation on human embryos The Vatican document is a call back to a simpler and in its view more natural ethic in which marriage sexuality and procreation are parts of an indivisible whole  the same ethic it invokes in opposing divorce and abortion For Rome the more frightening aspects of the new technologies  the specter of armies raised in testtubebaby factories  are the logical consequence of a dangerous hubris the sort of thing that happens when humans challenge an ethical order ordained by God The Vatican said Roman Catholicisms duty was defending man against the excesses of his own power So negative an assessment of mans dominion over himself is not commonly heard in America with its faith in unfettered individualism and in the liberating effects of technology Many Catholics as well as nonCatholics took issue with the document especially its ban on the use of new technologies by married couples who want children Many Catholic couples said they would deal with this aspect of the churchs teaching in the same way they dealt with its ban on birth control by ignoring it Yet the timeliness of the Vaticans cry of alarm almost certainly won the document a wider hearing than it would have received a decade ago The anguish of the Baby M trial has made many uneasy about the very idea of surrogate motherhood  and that is just part of the new anxiety over the sexual and medical revolutions The source of much of the strain can be summarized in one word AIDS For some believers AIDS is divine retribution against a society that had abandoned restraint But the spread of the disease has engendered a new caution even among the most sexually active Some demographers argue that the shift toward prudence began long before the threat of acquired immune deficiency syndrome Although it was encouraged by the birth control pill the sexual revolution was also the product of the sheer number of single people under 30 who happened to be alive in the 1960s Now with baby boomers marrying and having children the old morality seems at the least more practical to more people than it once did AIDS has introduced the sanction of death But AIDS raises questions for society not just individuals Officials worry that AIDS could strain the nations medical system at enormous cost Some politicians worried about an epidemic call on government to provide more sexual information to adolescents others call for mandatory testing for the disease For many conservatives the lesson of the disease is that permissive sexual behavior must be curbed But for the Surgeon General Dr C Everett Koop the urgent concern is how to keep the disease from spreading So this ardent foe of abortion finds himself championing sex education and advertisements for condoms Many of Dr Koops former allies see the ads as an affront to public modesty and to their sense of values Paul Maslin a liberal poll taker said the implicit message of condom advertising was clear Its a continuation of more sex  Other contradictions emerge as liberals and conservatives waver between the demands of the community and the rights of the individual Conservatives are the boldest defenders of laissezfaire in the marketplace But conservatives themselves like to point out that the market promotes innovation and revolution which often run roughshod over traditional moral values Moreover the new birth technologies are largely in the hands of entrepreneurs Social conservatives who want to restrict these technologies will meet headon with the champions of a private sector that wants to experiment and to sell Liberals are more inclined to support economic regulation and to speak of social consequences Yet Daniel Callaghan director of the Hastings Center which studies ethical issues in medicine noted that individual liberty in sexual matters has been one of the great liberal causes over the last few decades Liberals are fearful in the words of Mr Maslin that AIDS is the public health version of McCarthyism an excuse to roll back victories won by movements for womens rights homosexual rights and legal abortion On these issues many liberals will invoke the language of individualism many conservatives the idea of the common good Prof Kristin Luker a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley said the current period had its parallel in the Progressive era at the turn of the century when the nation also felt that existing social insitutions were inadequate to respond to venereal disease medical discovery and evidence of family breakdown One result she noted was mandatory blood testing before marriage Daniel P Moynihan New Yorks Democratic Senator believes that now as in the Progressive era worries over the state of the family are so widespread that liberals and conservatives show signs of joining in a new center to stem the forces of disintegration Still many Americans are edgy about the government doing too much about the family  and about sex As it has in the past the nation will probably be inclined to fall back on the sentiments expressed by Congressman John Canfield Spencer who explained American religious freedom to Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s If there were but two religions we should cut each others throats the Congressman said But no sect having the majority all have need of tolerance His words could apply to what these days are called sexual preferences and life styles Still Congressman Spencer did not have to deal with AIDS or testtube babies In their current mood more Americans than usual are asking the question that always haunts free societies Is tolerance enough
CATHOLIC TEACHINGS AR CHALLENGED IN DUTCH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/world/catholic-teachings-ar-challenged-in-dutch-court.html,The teachings of the Dutch Roman Catholic hierarchy on homosexuality and the status of women were put to court tests here recently that raised issues of discrimination and of freedom of religion Two civil rights groups sued the leader of the Dutch Catholic Church last month accusing it of encouraging discrimination against homosexuals and women The lawsuits sought to bar Adrianus Cardinal Simonis Archbishop of Utrecht and Primate of the Netherlands from preaching that homosexuality is unnatural and that women are inferior to men Verdicts were announced last week after two days of hearings in February A court in Utrecht threw out the feminist case on technical grounds and ruled in favor of Cardinal Simonis in the suit involving homosexuality Liberty to Preach The court suits highlighted the apparently wide gap between contemporary ways of life and the Popes emphasis on traditional social values The dispute raises the question of whether a religious leader should be allowed to preach a doctrine that deeply offends and even harms many people A Cardinal of the Catholic Church must have the liberty to preach without any restrictions on questions concerning Church doctrine said a statement issued this week by a group of European bishops This is a major part of the freedom of religion The statement prompted by the Dutch trials was highly unusual and appeared to underscore a strong degree of concern in church circles The bishops said they were deeply disturbed by the suits The two groups that filed the suits argued that freedom of religion does not allow church leaders Catholic or nonCatholic to encourage discrimination or to speak out in a way that may cause psychological harm to a large category of people Radio Interview Disputed We want to stop him from saying that it is understandable that people discriminate against homosexuals that the homosexual culture is bad for society said Willemien Ruygrok a spokeswoman for the Association for the Integration of Homosexuality which filed one of the suits The group which has been at odds with Cardinal Simonis for several years filed suit after the prelate said in a radio interview last month that he would understand if a Catholic property owner refused to rent an apartment to a homosexual I have to leave him the right to decide that way he said The Utrecht court ruled March 5 in favor of Cardinal Simonis saying that he is entitled to voice the Churchs opposition to homosexuality But the ruling left the door open to another suit if Parliament enacts a law forbidding discrimination against homosexuals Feminists Suit Rejected Meanwhile the suit lodged by a group of womens rights advocates including some feminist theologians was turned down on technical grounds The Utrecht court ruled that the advocates were not legally recognized when they filed the suit earlier this year so the complaint was declared invalid They had taken Cardinal Simonis to court over an article of his that said feminist theology threatens the priority of man in the order of creation Writing in a theological journal he pointed to the conception process as biological proof of the passive roles that he believes females play In his typically blunt style the 55year old Cardinal wrote in the 20page essay that a womens egg waits for the mans sperm which he described as the dynamic active masculine vector of new life Cardinal Simonis who was at the Vatican for consultations during the trial may have won something of a Pyrrhic victory in court The trials focused an exceptional amount of attention in this liberal country on the churchs conservative social beliefs In addition to Cardinal Simoniss views on homosexuality and the status of women church teachings on abortion birth control and mandatory celibacy for priests contrasted sharply with widespread attitudes in this country
POLL FINDS SOUTHERNERS VARY LITTLE FROM OTHER VOTERS IN EARLY '88 CHOICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/us/poll-finds-southerners-vary-little-from-other-voters-in-early-88-choices.html,Defying political stereotypes Southerners are following national trends and giving strong early support to Gary Hart and Vice President Bush for the 1988 Presidential nominations while rating such issues as school busing and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels as much less important than helping the homeless according to a poll for The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Although people in other parts of the country sometimes seem to think of the Southern voter as fundamentally different from themselves the results of the 12state survey by the Roper Organization cast doubt on this view of the South As expected Southerners generally rated social and moral issues as of much greater concern to them than most economic or foreign policy issues But beyond that Southerners said they were more concerned about drunken driving drug abuse and AIDS than they were about abortion school prayer the death penalty and busing issues often thought to be of particular importance in the South The poll is being published a year before the South will become the scene of a series of primaries and caucuses next March 8  so many on the same day that politicians have dubbed it Super Tuesday  and the survey found little evidence that Southern voters differ greatly in their early thoughts about the next Presidential nominees Religion Not a Big Influence While being a bornagain Christian is still a political plus in the South for instance the Rev Pat Robertsons bid for the Republican nomination is finding scant support even among those people who like the idea of a bornagain candidate the telephone survey of 5523 adults in 12 states found Among 1952 people who said they would probably vote in a Republican primary Mr Bush has a commanding lead over his closest competitor Senator Bob Dole and the Vice President appeared to be the primary beneficiary of former Senator Howard H Baker Jrs withdrawal to accept the position of White House chief of staff Fiftythree percent backed Mr Bush 17 percent were for Mr Dole 10 percent for Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and 9 percent for Mr Robertson On the Democratic side while Southern party leaders intended that an early regional primary would help produce a more conservative nominee the Rev Jesse Jackson is running a powerful second to Mr Hart with the two candidates running essentially even in Alabama and Louisiana and Mr Jackson ahead in Mississippi At the same time Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia the favorite of many Democratic leaders in the region was rated a distant third with most of his support confined to Georgia The Well Known Do Well With the campaign still in its early stages  Mr Nunn for example has removed himself from consideration for at least the next six months  general name recognition rather than a deep degree of support is undoubtedly a major factor in the poll results being published in the Atlanta paper But at this stage of the campaign at least the poll found that Mr Hart was backed by 35 percent of the 2253 who said they would vote in the Democratic primary Mr Jackson by 21 percent Mr Nunn by 11 percent Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas by 6 percent and Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri by 4 percent The poll to be published Sunday had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points for each party In 1984 Mr Hart won the Florida primary but finished behind Walter F Mondale in Georgia and Alabama Previous surveys by The New York TimesCBS News Poll and other major organizations have not found Southern opinion on many issues to be dramatically different when results have been broken down by region But this poll because of its size scope and the unusual role the Southern regional primary is expected to play in the coming Presidential campaign is of particular interest in providing a detailed look at the voters thinking For example when asked to rate their concern on 21 issues 50 percent said they were very concerned about abortion 58 percent about school prayer 45 percent about the death penalty and 36 percent about school busing By contrast 84 percent said they were very concerned about drunken driving 83 percent about drug abuse and 79 percent about AIDS Helping the homeless also ranked high with 65 percent saying they were very concerned as did education 79 percent very concerned and crime 79 percent very concerned Less Concern on Foreign Policy Foreign policy issues generally ranked lower as areas of concern On aid to the Nicaraguan rebels for example 38 percent said they were very concerned In fact just 35 percent of the Southern Republicans rated the issue that high On the Star Wars missile defense plan 32 percent of the voters said they were very concerned while 45 percent said they were very concerned about relations with the Soviet Union Economic issues tended to rank significantly higher among Southern Democrats than Southern Republicans For example 75 percent of the Democrats said they were very concerned about Social Security as against 56 percent of the Republicans 70 percent of the Democrats said they were very concerned about taxes as against 59 percent of the Republicans and 50 percent of the Democrats said they were very concerned about inflation as against 31 percent of the Republicans Race Is Played Down When Southerners were given a hypothetical choice and told to make a decision based on just one set of facts about a candidate they asserted that race and regional origin were of comparatively small importance If all they knew was that one candidate was white and the other was black for example 8 percent said they would back the black candidate 21 percent the white candidate and 71 percent said they did not know or could not say Given a choice between a candidate who supported affirmative action and one who regarded it as reverse discrimination 45 percent said they would support the former 21 percent the latter and 35 percent declined to answer Supporting a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in the schools turned out to be a strength for a candidate while support for President Reagans antimissile plan called Star Wars in the poll question was a plus for Republicans and a minus for Democrats On the other questions there was little difference between the responses of Repoublicans and Democrats Similarly if all they knew about two candidates was that one was a Southerner and the other was not 28 percent said they would back the Southerner 10 percent the nonSoutherner and 62 percent declined to make the choice But given a choice between a bornagain candidate and one who was not 49 percent said they would back the bornagain candidate 14 percent the candidate who was not bornagain and 37 percent declined to answer Little Help for Robertson That preference for bornagain politicians was of only modest use to the television evangelist Pat Robertson who has been expected to draw considerable support in the Bible Belt Among those Republicans who said they would prefer a bornagain candidate only 16 percent were for Mr Robertson as against 51 percent who said they were for Mr Bush 15 percent for Mr Dole and 9 percent for Mr Kemp Those polled felt more negative toward Mr Robertson than toward any other Republican listed with 69 percent of the Republicans  including 57 percent of the Republicans who favored bornagain candidates  saying they would not consider voting for him perhaps reflecting the traditional Baptist disposition toward a strict separation of church and state Mr Jackson had the highest negative associations on the Democratic side with 47 percent of the Democrats saying they would not consider voting for him Mr Jackson had the support of 52 percent of the blacks and 7 percent of the whites The poll made no real effort to identify who would vote in the Southern primaries and caucuses But among those Republican respondents who said they voted in most or all elections 48 percent were for Mr Bush 21 percent for Mr Dole 11 percent for Mr Kemp 8 percent for Mr Robertson and 1 percent for Pierre S duPont 4th Among Democrats in that category 36 percent were for Mr Hart 19 percent for Mr Jackson 12 percent for Mr Nunn 8 percent for Mr Bumpers and 4 percent for Mr Gephardt The survey was conducted in 12 Southern states with nominating contests expected on or around March 8 often known as Super Tuesday Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Texas and Virginia As many as six more states may hold primaries or caucuses at the time Some potential Presidential contenders were not included in the survey questionnaire but findings in those same states in a recent New York TimesCBS News Poll showed that none of those omitted had the support of more than 2 percent of their partys primary voters ELECTION ISSUES IN THE SOUTH Percentage of those who said they were very concerned about an issue in poll by Roper for The Atlanta Journal

'L.A. LAW' - IS IT LAW OR IS IT JUST L.A.?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/arts/la-law-is-it-law-or-is-it-just-la.html,TO TELEVISION PROducers the courthouse looks like it ought to be good theater This fascination with the courtroom and its professionals is understandable at least to a judge and former practitioner Most viewers live in a world far removed from courts lawyers and judges  and distance breeds mystery The news media spotlight dramatic cases thus whetting the publics appetite for more exposure Television is still kept out of most courtrooms frustrating live coverage of real cases Television dramas therefore compensate by inventing cases The genre of courthouse television is varied and venerable Some syndicated series like Divorce Court and Peoples Court try to replicate an actual case with only a few deviations While these shows have loyal followings their formats dont allow for much character or plot development Other TV productions like the Perry Mason specials are generally disdained by judges and lawyers because the courtroom is distorted for dramatic purposes Woe betide a citizen who tries to apply any Perry Mason learning to reallife jury service NBCs LA Law on the other hand tries to bridge the gap and it succeeds sometimes The lawyers in this weekly series act like lawyers  sometimes The tensions and conflicts of the story lines can be quite real  sometimes The series for all of its emphasis on the supercharged sex lives of its younger characters may fall short of providing its viewers with realistic and insightful glimpses into the everyday problems of law firms and their clients yet it comes a lot closer than its predecessors probably as close as the onehour format permits The strength of LA Law is its willingness to take on at least a few tough legal subjects and try to depict them in a realistic manner For instance one recent episode dealt with the capitalpunishment trial of a lifer The prisoner while serving a life sentence in the penitentiary was accused of killing one of his prison guards That kind of situation encapsulates the most controversial aspect of the whole capitalpunishment debate When as a member of the Illinois State Legislature I sponsored bills to abolish capital punishment I had a cop killer exception in every bill I introduced  to keep capital punishment available for criminals who killed policemen or prison guards It was the only way I could gather enough support for such bills to get them off the ground When that exception is made however many more exceptions seem logical and fair The principle evaporates LA Law handled this conundrum with skill The episode used a bifurcated trial for the prisoner where the jury first deliberated only the question of guilt or innocence After the jury found him guilty the jurors were asked to deliberate whether or not he should get a death sentence This is the way most capital cases now are tried since the U S Supreme Court indicated that such a process was more likely to pass constitutional muster Susan Deys character Grace Van Owen as the prosecutor made a convincing case for the propostion that a twotime killer already under a life sentence would be likely to kill again there was she argued no way to prevent this repetition except to execute the defendant The defense counsel made a short but moving appeal to the jury to consider the irrationality of first deciding that it was a most heinous crime for the prisoner to have taken a life and then to turn around and punish this killer by killing him Some opponents of capital punishment call it legalized murder The tension was well built and when the jury foreman announced the vote for the death penalty it was high drama indeed Unfortunately even here the tight time format forced a tradeoff with reality The prisoner a black sociopath looked absolutely ruthless and totally devoid of human feeling Most killers dont make it quite that easy on their jurors or judges The murderer usually has a mother shows remorse denies his guilt or somehow puts the question of executing him into a more difficult balance On LA Law everything from the race of the killer on down was in black and white Gray is apparently not an easy color to develop in a show carrying three or more plot lines and a lot of chitchat Steven Bochco the coproducer of the series has a wonderful capacity to use small talk and dialogue unrelated to the plot to develop his characters He did it in the longrunning series Hill Street Blues and he does it equally well in LA Law Lawyers like police officers we learn from Mr Bochco have families financial problems a need to use the bathroom and to file tax returns Their chats are often revealing but there is a down side The series is all decked out with small talk and high drama Little preparation time seems necessary before going to court or meeting with a client The series courtroom lawyers  the main ones are Michael Kuzak played by Harry Hamlin Grace Van Owen and Victor Sifuentes Jimmy Smits  appear to work with smoke and mirrors to win tough cases The other format carryover from Hill Street Blues is the simultaneous development of three or four story lines on each show Like the chitchat it adds the face of reality Big law firms do handle more than one case at a time and their lawyers conduct several courtroom dramas at once However with about 45 minutes of story time this splitscreen method further constricts real subject or character development The net result of these writing devices is that the people look threedimensional but not very real When an installment is finished the viewer has to fill in a lot of pieces in the character outline The characters on LA Law may have more facets than those that populate Perry Mason but they fail to emerge as anyone I have known The cases with a few exceptions do not sound like the bill of fare of any real law firm even a Los Angeles firm To its credit the series does make it clear that a law firm is a business On occasion the writers focus on this for an engaging story as when Michael Kuzak struggled with the representation of a large pharmaceutical company whose product had caused serious injury to some customers Other times the writers seem to reach into outer space as when they depicted a mass competition between between five law firms each making simultaneous presentations to a potential client This sequence lacked credibility and class There is also a lot of pap on LA Law The young lawyers are all oversexed While I am sure that the legal profession has its share of redhot lovers hours spent on hankypanky are not billable  at least not ethically billable I do not see how a law firm can stay afloat with such a large portion of time devoted to nonlegal affairs LA Law spends considerable time on the characteristics of the law partners and the relationship between them In this respect it does a good job  sometimes Leland McKenzie looks like every senior partner I have ever known I read that Richard Dysart the actor who plays McKenzie says he would like to see a few steamy love scenes added for his character also On the other hand the partner Douglas Brachman Jr played by Alan Rachins is a starkly drawn moneygrubber His dialogue and character can be believable only to the true lawyerhater The judges in LA Law rarely rise above the stereotype This is not unusual on television The high bench and the black robe seem to discourage television writers from looking for human qualities in judges Consequently the judge is usually a minor character whose dialogue is limited to saying overruled to the lawyers objections The one judge I saw portrayed at length in LA Law was under indictment Without the robe and the elevated chair he came across like any other caught crook Whatever its deficiencies as a model for real life in a bigcity law firm LA Law seems to be as close as television viewers want to get to real lawyers and real lawsuits Given the low standing of the legal profession in the eyes of most viewers LA Law probably treats lawyers better than they have any right to expect TVS PRECEDENTS Television lawyers have never been as popular as cowboys or cops but they have been the subjects of series every few years starting as early as 1951 with the adaptation from radio of Mr District Attorney The bestknown series of course and the longestrunning was Perry Mason starring Raymond Burr as a criminal defense lawyer with an uncanny knack for eliciting 11thhour courtroom confessions from culprits The series ran from 1957 to 1966 and still comes back periodically in the form of madeforTV movies The other legal series of particular note was The Defenders with E G Marshall and Robert Reed as a fatherson law firm that took on cases involving some of the more controversial issues of the day Abortion civil rights blacklisting The series which ran from 1961 to 1965 was created by Reginald Rose As a legal drama The Defenders was distinctive for among other things the quality of its writing Before and after The Defenders television law tended to be more comfortable and less complicated Fairly typical of the genre was The Law and Mr Jones a series about an idealistic lawyer Abraham Lincoln Jones played by James Whitmore from 1960 to 1962 From 1969 to 1972 there was The Lawyers part of a series called The Bold Ones that alternated in the same weekly time slot with doctors lawenforcement authorities and a senator And from 1971 to 1974 came Owen Marshall in which Arthur Hill played a fatherly defense attorney who became involved in the lives of his clients  Sandra Salmans

VATICAN RULING GREETED CALMLY BY VERMONTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/16/us/vatican-ruling-greeted-calmly-by-vermonters.html,On this sunny almostspring morning in this small central Vermont town the worshipers at St Cecilias Roman Catholic Church had a variety of spiritual concerns and worldly distractions on their minds But it appeared unlikely that the Vaticans Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origins and on the Dignity of Procreation issued last week was weighing heavily on any of the 200 people in this parish which is a mixture of white and bluecollar workers with a handful of dairy farmers Msgr Edward Fitzsimons did not raise the subject at mass and those parishioners who were interviewed before and after services said they had heard about the directive which details the churchs stance on such issues as genetic engineering and testtube fertilization only in passing Until Father Fitzsimons preaches about it on the altar we dont think about it a lot said William Robie Awaiting More Information But this does not mean that the teachings of Rome are ignored by the faithful who gather in the renovated farmhouse that serves as a church Parishioners here said they would wait to read more about the directive in local newspapers national newsmagazines and in the Catholic Tribune published by the Diocese of Burlington Most agreed with Mr Robie that the directive seems to make sense But Mr Robie who is 44 years old said he has found himself questioning other Vatican rulings such as the ban on artificial methods of birth control The father of three children  he also has four stepchildren  said Catholics must decide such issues individually Its not that I dont care about the churchs teachings he said but sometimes it seems that religion and reality are two different things Adhering to Tradition Monsignor Fitzsimons 75 years old and pastor here for 11 years said that most of his parishioners would be inclined to believe in the directives of the Vatican as long as they see truth in the teachings He said he has no plans to preach a sermon on the directive but said it would probably serve as the basis of future homilies Michel and Jeanne Bedard consider themselves traditional Catholics products of parochial schools who have always adhered to church teachings Mr Bedard 66 a retired dairy farmer said he will wait to read about the directive in the diocesan paper because he does not feel the secular press adequately interprets church teachings Speaking with the accent of his French Canadian heritage he said that what he has learned of the directive seems consistent with church doctrine Compassion for the Childless Mrs Bedard 67 who bore eight children and raised seven  one died in infancy  softened when she spoke of women unable to bear children I know they want the babies awful bad she said but I think God just doesnt want them to have children I know its hard but thats the way life is sometimes Donna and Ronald Putney were childless for the first seven years of their marriage Their first baby was stillborn They adopted two girls and then Mrs Putney gave birth to a son and daughter We went a long time without being able to have children said Mrs Putney 39 who is a medical assistant in a health center I can understand how people can get to the point of trying almost anything Nevertheless she said she has problems with the notion of surrogate mothers Deciding for Themselves Mr Putney a truck driver said he had skipped over the article about the Vatican directive in the newspaper Mrs Putney was unaware of the ruling until questioned about it Both said they will use the teachings as a guideline but will make up their own minds Tim Gauthier may have paid more attention than most to the ruling Mr Gauthier 30 is a convert to Catholicism who spent four years studying to become a priest His wife Vicki 28 is expecting their second child next month When several months ago Mrs Gauthier took a blood test which can detect the possibility of mental retardation in the fetus the couple discussed the possibility of abortion We decided we couldnt do it said Mrs Gauthier Mr Gauthier who works with disabled adults said he is especially aware that people with disabilities can have full and joyful lives The test was negative People must examine their consciences in such matters said Mr Gauthier Such examination he said involves praying for guidance
LEGAL ISSUES SEEN IN VATICAN CALL FOR LAWS TO BAR BIRTH TECHNOLOGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/16/us/legal-issues-seen-in-vatican-call-for-laws-to-bar-birth-technology.html,The Vaticans recent proposals urging governments to ban medical intervention in human reproduction raise serious constitutional issues that could soon emerge in state legislatures and the courts legal scholars say The experts say that if laws supporting the Vaticans position are adopted challenges to them would center on two legal doctrines the right to privacy in decisions controlling a humans body and church and state separation under the First Amendment to the Constitution In condemning virtually all artificial methods of reproduction the Vatican urged governments to enact laws that would bar genetic counseling surrogate motherhood embryo and sperm banks various forms of artificial insemination testtube fertilization and experimentation on embryos Problems Date to 1978 According to legal scholars the Vaticans doctrinal statement comes as states are grappling with proposals on how best to regulate a technology that has led to legal problems since 1978 when the first testtube baby was conceived The problems touch laws relating to the family contracts tort liability and inheritance among others Some states have passed laws regulating research on embryos produced through testtube fertilization And as more and more children are born every year through new medical techniques state legislatures appear to be close to proposing laws to control or constrict the availability of new reproductive technology Some proposals however would possibly expand use of these techniques On a Federal level the odds are very low that Congress would ban many of the techniques cited in the Vatican statement said Senator Albert Gore a Tennessee Democrat who is vice chairman of Congresss Biomedical Ethics Board Mr Gore interviewed today on the NBC News program Meet the Press said however that Congress might consider legislation dealing with surrogate motherhood Such legislation he said might require a grace period for a woman who has agreed to bear the child of a man who is not her husband to change her mind and keep the child Challenge Based on Privacy There is a need for legislation but I dont think we should be forced to choose between a completely laissezfaire approach on the one hand or an outright and total ban on the other extreme Mr Gore said An authority on constitutional law John Hart Ely the dean of the Stanford University Law School said These are issues that are very difficult that people are in conflict about even without the church wading in Dean Ely said in an interview that if states adopted laws restricting artificial means of reproduction the laws could be challenged as unconstitutional on privacy grounds established by Supreme Court rulings involving the use of contraceptives and abortion Much of the language in the decisions on contraceptives and abortion are broad enough to cover these issues Dean Ely said but he added that in recent years the United States Supreme Court had tended to view privacy issues not on previously established principles but on a casebycase basis For example he noted the Court chose not to strike down state laws on sodomy last year Religion is Part of Life Dean Ely and other legal scholars said a challenge to Vaticaninspired legislation on the First Amendment doctrine of separation of church and state also could be raised But he said it might be more difficult to prove because religious pressure or input in the legislative debate is not necessarily unconstitutional Ronald Garet a professor of religion and constitutional law at the University of Southern California Law School put it this way It seems to me that religion is part of life To strike down laws because they are partially religiously motivated would be to strike down most laws I dont think the Catholic Church is stepping outside the rights or obligations in a democratic society The issue should be fought on the substance Even so civil liberties advocates recognize the power of religious positions on social issues Faye Wattleton the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in an interview The Catholic Church is not reluctant to press its cause through our laws We have a country that does not have a state religion nor should it The notion that the hierarchy would suggest that lawmakers take the Catholic doctrine and make it law is quite disturbing Efforts to Outlaw Abortion She added that Planned Parenthood would mount a legal challenge should legislation be adopted by state legislatures barring the use of new reproductive techniques Since 1973 when the Supreme Court held that abortions under certain circumstances were legal groups opposing abortion have used a variety of strategies including lobbying efforts at the state and national level to overturn the decision One method is to try to declare a fetus a person Abortion opponents have fought for laws in 16 states that have granted fetuses implicit rights as persons These laws permit the prosecution for homicide when a fetus is killed in a criminal attack on the mother Douglas Johnson the legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee in Washington DC hailed the Vaticans strong opposition to genetic counseling a technique he described as a search and destroy mission that enabled a woman to have an abortion if through screening tests she learned her baby would suffer birth defects Regulations in California Last year California became the first state in the nation to adopt regulations requiring physicians to inform pregnant women of the availability of a blood test that may show the presence of a deformed newborn Another test can determine whether an infant has spina bifida a condition that leaves an opening in the spinal column Sometimes spina bifida is accompanied by hydrocephalus excessive cranial fluid and microcephaly a partially formed brain In Sacramento Brian Johnston the western coordinator for the National Right to Life Committee said the Vaticans declaration would give his group impetus to seek litigation to overturn the California health regulations which he said have helped lead women to have abortions Experiments on Embryos The Vatican also condemned experimentation on embryos as well as the use of embryo and sperm banks Eighteen states have adopted laws prohibiting embryo research when done in connection with an abortion And some states have adopted or are proposing statutes to prevent the abuse or discarding of embryos created through in vitro fertilization In that process where fertilization occurs outside the womans womb excess embryos are often created and used in research Last year for example a law was enacted in Louisiana that makes the embryo a juridical person The law gives an in vitro embryo all the rights of a person and requires the appointment of a guardian to protect the in vitro fertilized human ovums rights Lori B Andrews a research fellow at the American Bar Association and an expert in the legal aspects of new reproductive techniques said in a recent article that the new Louisiana law may deter physicians from offering even basic in vitro fertilization because the law imposes a high standard of care on physicians who deal with the embryos That standard includes the cumbersome procedure of requiring registration of each embryo and presumably requiring death certificates as well she said
AUSTRALIANS COOL TO VATICAN PAPER,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/19/world/australians-cool-to-vatican-paper.html,As a pioneer in fertility research and home to more than 1000 socalled test tube babies Australia has reacted sharply to the Vaticans condemnation last week of artificial means of procreation Even Australias large Catholic minority which is 26 percent of Australias 16 million people has responded with some perplexity at times laced with hostility to the Vatican pronouncement Im a practicing Catholic and I dont regard myself as sinful said James Leong a Sydney doctor who runs an artificial insemination clinic Ive helped about 600 couples have children My conscience is clear The Vatican instruction one week ago denounced such practices as artificial insemination testtube fertilization and the freezing of embryos Wont Pay Attention In the final analysis people wont pay much attention to it said Margaret Brooks a Melbourne Catholic whose twoyearold son John was the first boy ever born from a frozen embryo These days Mrs Brooks is trying to have another child by the same means because she and her husband cannot have a child normally She learned Monday that a recent implantation of another embryo also fertilized in a test tube was unsuccessful However she says she will try again as soon as possible I didnt get any flack at mass on Sunday she said All were asking for is to allow a man and wife to have a family Australia is significant in its reaction to the Vatican statement for two reasons Leaders in a Science First it is one of the leaders in the rapidly developing science of enhancing fertility Hospitals all over the country offer fertilization in a test tube the mixing in a laboratory of a couples egg and sperm cells and their reimplantation in the mothers womb Scientists are now moving into new areas such as freezing a womans egg cells for later use and methods of extracting sperm from men who cannot ejaculate Second Australia has a large Catholic population and one that is very involved in various fertility programs Several program directors said that 30 percent or more of their patients were Catholics a figure that is higher than their incidence in the population The doctors attributed this to what they described as an emphasis in Catholicism on rearing children Australian Catholics like their American counterparts often appear to take the teachings of the Vatican loosely While viewing Rome with great respect they rely on their own judgments as well as church doctrines in making decisions about such questions as contraception sexual relations and abortion Two years ago the Australian state of Victoria became the first jurisdiction in the world to pass comprehensive legislation governing fertilization in test tubes and other artificial means of procreation On Federal Guidelines Other Australian states are also considering legislation and a senior Government official said the Australian Cabinet was preparing a report to Parliament that could lead to Federal guidelines The official said the Cabinet discussions had been only preliminary and it was too soon to say whether Federal legislation will result We will see a high degree of politicization of this research later this year in Australia and possibly the United Kingdom said Russell Scott a Sydney lawyer who writes and lectures widely on medical ethics It seems unlikely however that Australian Catholics will exert strong pressure for new legislative restrictions for even the Catholic clergy here have mixed feelings about the Vatican statement The Rev Bill Daniel a prominent Jesuit moral theologian in Melbourne said he sympathized with the Churchs attempt to tackle difficult issues but that he thought the Vatican had gone too far Headline in Perth It does happen that embryos are put aside for a rainy day but it doesnt always happen and you cant build a universal condemnation based on what sometimes happens Father Daniel said Not everyone has been so sympathetic The Sunday Times a local newspaper this week carried a large headline Perth takes offense at Popes IVF decision An editorial in the same issue criticized the archaic view of the Vatican statement John F Porter executive officer of the Infertility Medical Center at Monash University in Melbourne said It seems to me that theres an elderly male and celibate hierarchy imposing its own anachronistic view on its laity In the face of such criticism Catholic clergy stressed that most of the reaction to the statement was based only on press reports of its contents and that they had not had a chance yet to read it The Rev Raymond Campbell a theologian in Sydney who agrees with the Vatican statement stressed that the Vaticans positions on emerging issues like fertilization in a test tube flowed from its wellknown teaching that procreation must take place in the context of marriage and that human life is sacred from conception

RUNNING GUNS TO ARCADIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/books/running-guns-to-arcadia.html,THE AMERICAN CONNECTION US Guns Money and Influence in Northern Ireland By Jack Holland Illustrated 272 pp New York Viking 1995 IN Chicago in the 1880s Patrick Pagan OLeary urged Irish immigrants to help free their native land from British rule by joining the Fenian movement for Irish nationalism OLeary also called upon IrishAmericans to abandon their Roman Catholic religion which he said with keen Irish malice had made them good for nothing but thumping their craws and telling their beads Claiming that the Apostle of Ireland had demoralized the Irish by teaching them to forgive their enemies OLeary had abandoned his baptismal name of Patrick and urged his listeners to do the same In answer to OLearys call the Irish stayed away from him in droves When it came to nationalism particularly with a strong antiBritish accent IrishAmericans were boisterously proIrish but not if it conflicted with other values This pattern persisted a century later in United States Presidential politics as recounted in The American Connection by Jack Holland Democratic vicepresidential candidate Geraldine Ferraros strong record of interest in Northern Ireland proved to be of secondary importance even to those Irish Americans active on the issue many of them showed that they were more concerned with attacking her for her prochoice position on abortion than they were with supporting her because of her commitment to human rights in Northern Ireland Contradictions abound How can conservative IrishAmericans support the Irish Republican Army with its Marxist philosophy and connections to Libya and other terrorist regimes How can so many IrishAmericans admire President Reagan ignoring his close ties to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher a woman Mr Holland says they habitually denounce as an ogress He suggests that Irish Americas view of Ireland tends to be arcadian  a reverie of the past in which the world was innocent free from contradictions rural and simple Northern Irelands sectarian strife random violence and code of compulsory revenge form a familiar pattern World War III is not likely to start in Derry or Belfast but Ulster does resemble the Middle East save for the fact that it is geopolitically insignificant and has few natural resources Intractable politics means that people live and die in an atmosphere of hatred despair and more than occasional danger Like the Middle East Northern Ireland hears few voices of objective calm but Mr Holland has penetrated the factional din He analyzes the contradictions the political hypocrisies the drenchedintreacle murderous sentiment that attends the Irish question in the United States and Britain Having reported from Dublin Belfast London and New York for The Daily News The Irish Echo and other publications he knows that no one has an instant program of easy solutions He skillfully discusses gunrunning operations on behalf of the IRA as well as the countervailing initiative waged by Irish diplomats in the United States Congress This lobbying effort has helped defuse proIRA sentiment here And the antiviolence stand of the socalled Big Four  Senators Edward M Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan Thomas P ONeill the former Speaker of the House and Hugh Carey the former Governor of New York  helped form the basis for the marginally helpful AngloIrish Agreement signed in November 1985 MR HOLLAND is critical of the court system in the United States and harsher yet on the American press which is he charges a conduit of either British or IRA propaganda The consensus view  of religious fanatics held back by a kindly British referee  suffocated any intelligent discussion of Northern Ireland in the US throughout the 1970s he writes And he also condemns reporting through the eyes of a sentimental tough guy persona derived it would seem from popular American detective fiction    The object is blurred by melodrama The Northern Ireland issue becomes a backdrop to the drama of the journalists feelings about it Important civilliberties issues attract little liberal comment in the press he writes because silence is unfortunately in keeping with the infatuation of American liberal intellectuals with England which has led them to ignore Northern Ireland  perhaps because it provides too many startling contradictions to their own rather sentimental notions about English civilization If Mr Holland has a bias it is against the British Government less for its policies toward Northern Ireland than for its lack of them Apathy marks the British political attitude toward Ulster despite the cost in lives and treasure When a debate on the subject begins in the House of Commons members begin to drift away as rapidly as the Irish in Chicago abandoned the lectures of Pagan OLeary The Irish themselves regard Ulster as less important than their own economic problems or even their fascination with British royalty Walking in Dublin during a royal wedding I found the streets empty at noon everyone inside glued to the telly It was as though a neutron bomb of proBritish sentiment had struck the Irish capital Mr Holland hopes for more intelligent and less romantic American involvement with Ireland and he provides a guide for those who wish to decide for themselves just who the villains and heroes are For an overdraft of greenbeer sentiment The American Connection is a lively chaser bubbling with cold reality Jack Holland has a unique vantage point from which to view the strife in Northern Ireland and its political religious and legal complexities He was born in the Falls Road Roman Catholic ghetto in Belfast of a family that was mixed Catholic and Protestant He was educated in Belfast Dublin and England As a journalist he worked in Ireland both North and South and in New York and lived in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn until last July when he moved to a small village near Rome with his wife Mary a New Yorker and his daughter Jenny But he still visits Belfast and New York on a regular basis His mixed background gave him access to IrishAmerican groups here and the warring factions in Belfast Quite a few of my friends were involved in the troubles on both sides But the 39yearold Irishman has not been drawn into the quagmire I always regarded myself as a journalist an outsider otherwise I couldnt be objective he said in a telephone interview from Italy where he is writing a historical novel He sees parallels between the strife in Northern Ireland and the American South in the 1950s He spoke of a powerful almost racist hostility toward Catholics from the Unionists particularly the workingclass Unionists But Mr Holland has avoided the pitfalls of advising IrishAmericans on what role if any they should play in Northern Ireland Im not an advocate that they should do anything except get to know as much as they can about the subject

THE COMIC BAD MEN OF ENGLISH LETTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/books/the-comic-bad-men-of-english-letters.html,THE British have rarely produced the philosophical novel the serious political novel or the novel of esthetic exactitude What they have produced is the writer of many mediations the writer who is party to commonplace and ordinary stuff of life the realist the observer the humorist Political and social attitudes even strong ideas may play a part but it is best if these are presented as prejudices instincts or eccentricities rather than theories or ideologies Indeed one of the things that has mediated social political and intellectual life in Britain is its capacity for manifest humor And this may be why one of the great triumphs and major pleasures of the British fictional tradition is the comic novel we have a great comic line in the novel and it still goes on But even in this matter the British taste has been generally for the untheoretical Indeed the ideologically or philosophically obsessed have usually seemed in British comic fiction the enemies of reality and the true comic instinct  Thwackum and Square in Tom Jones the dreaming Transcendentalists in Martin Chuzzlewit and so on to Professor Welch and his Bloomsbury artistic coterie in Kingsley Amiss Lucky Jim a novel that undoubtedly owed as much of its success to maintaining the 18thcentury fictional tradition as it did to providing a radical view of its own time the 1950s This is not the only place where Amis does homage to Fielding and in British fiction he has been far from alone Tom Jones said Edward Gibbon may be considered the history of human nature and the comic novel of human nature has long been found the true British way of doing fictional things Evelyn Waugh is one of the genres great modern practitioners  a writer of the very highest distinction and originality whose irascible disguises served to hide him from readers strangers and much of the argument of the world who was able to sustain at the highest level of arrogance a virtually unattainable intellectual and social position and in general to claim as the very center of writing the proprietorial seigneurial rights of the English eccentric As it happens and as it often happens Waugh possessed remarkable intellectual qualities  a strong sense of history which he had maneuvered into a theory of a decline and fall that had started with the end of Roman Catholic dominance in Britain and was now quite irredeemable Edmund Wilson the great American critic who had a good deal of Waughs temper and admired him greatly until he met him and found himself treated  as an American  with contempt aptly identified his fictional and social manner with that of Benjamin Jowetts advice to the gentleman Never apologize never explain Waugh did not explain or not in public the diaries explain and explain him a good deal He invented remarkable new techniques for fiction but professed enormous dislike for the modernist avantgarde  indeed as time went on for everything that had happened in his own lifetime When World War II ended Waughs style shaken by the experiences of wartime and the coming of the welfare state that followed seemed halfspent The new generation of writers gradually emerged their air apparently puritanical and socially of the lower middle class their tweedy sports jackets hanging badly off their shoulders their mildly leftofcenter social principles asserted everywhere It was not it seemed to Waugh a climate for his kind of writing and he raged against it As for the most comically assured of the new writers Kingsley Amis whose impact on the 1950s came to rival that of Waugh on the 1920s he seemed in almost every respect Waughs antithesis Waugh had portrayed British society in a state of irremediable historical decadence Amis mocked the past and spoke straight from the plain and ordinary present Waugh found an older history from which he could gain some sustenance Amis attacked all that was nostalgic and medievalizing in the British character every notion of a Merrie England and found his sustenance in the commonplace the provincial the bottle of beer and the blonde Waugh had a religious rage with the contemporary historical world Amis seemed full of secular delight in its stuff and its ways If the two looked like literary opposites the distinction applied equally in political matters Waugh was not simply a writer of conservative instincts he offered himself as the one true conservative Amis on the other hand appeared part of the New Left that was emerging in postwar Britain in an era when there was a new appeal for literary commitment At St Johns College Oxford in 1941 he had indeed been an undergraduate Communist the only party I have ever joined of course at a time when Britain and the Soviet Union were allies During the 1950s he was teaching at a British redbrick Swansea and announcing himself a probable lifetime Labor voter Later forsaking the redbrick world about which he had written he went to a fellowship at Peterhouse Cambridge with every prospect of a career uniting the academic and the literary the critical and creative functions But Cambridge did not suit whether because of its often backbiting attitude toward those with literary ambitions or because criticism itself was being pushed heavily toward more theoretical preoccupations is not quite clear It was now that Amis entered on the life of the fulltime writer with great success Even so matters were changing Lucky Jim and the books that immediately followed were enormously successful and caught the temper of the times coupling brilliant comic effects with a sharp sense of social process and even social protest The poetry was admirable in the new rationalcritical antimodernist way and displayed comic vision good feeling and common sense In an era of purity of diction Amiss essays were forceful and accessible pieces of literary criticism and he was clearly a central figure of the new antimodernist Movement mood But the manner was shifting along with his political sympathies Amis might well protest it was the world that was changing and he remaining the same but the fiction seems to record a different story At any rate his politics moved toward the right and today he defines himself as a Tory with a few liberal bits on hanging homosexuality abortion But the liberal bits are only occasionally noticeable The writer who began to write in the spirit of humanist common sense in a postwar time took on rage and spleen sometimes invested against the human condition itself as in the very good Ending Up 1974 one of his deepest novels and sometimes in a latterday social ire arrayed against the entire modernity of the modern world The writer who wrote compassionately in Take a Girl Like You 1960 of the change in sexual and emotional manners became in later books like Jakes Thing 1978 a notable misogynist in the age of feminism The critic who admired the radical impact of American fiction in the 50s began to rage against the worthlessness of American writing INDEED in many ways Kingsley Amis seemed slowly to have inherited the role of the Comic Bad Man of English Letters which Waugh had so powerfully sustained a generation earlier Now the similarities begin to look very evident Both of them had begun as spectacular Young Turks  writing the novels of their new age in which the topic of the younger generation was very much discussed  and turned into Angry Old Men Both had captured in subject and style the manners moral upsets cultural dislocations and social instabilities generated by a recent war Both were strictly antiromantic writers who carried to their work a secret but gradually more explicit nostalgia Both revolted against the extremities of experimentalism and the modern movement Both darkened deeply with the years taking on a pervasive awareness of the absurdity of the social world as well as the hideous weight of mortality into which human life is born so that their comedy is touched with pain Both turned youthful attitudes that seemed fresh and exciting into something crusted with an air of powerful prejudice and protected those prejudices with an engaging but troubling comic conviction Both as they grew into public figures turned their comic masks into public faces into a manner that was both clubbable and crusty amusing and bitter rotund and misanthropic a disguise that did not quite seem to disguise everything And both this can certainly be said of Waugh and I think we will say it of Amis  turned with their virtues and their faults into major writers of extraordinary dimensions and decided influence It has been said that few contemporary comic writers can get free of the intonations of Kingsley Amis and the tradition of modern comic fiction in Britain has an inescapable source in Evelyn Waugh who will I think be seen as one of the great black humorists of the century Both suggest that the comic is a rare stylistic capacity and also a form of human pain and both indicate what I think is a very British way of dealing with it which may have striking limitations and peculiar strengths And both are difficult to write about as a result provoking annoyance and respect a sense of a talent often imperfect yet of an extraordinary force
"L.I. BISHOP, ONCE QUIET, NOW EMBROILED IN BATTLES",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/nyregion/li-bishop-once-quiet-now-embroiled-in-battles.html,During most of the decade that he has led the sizable number of Roman Catholics on Long Island Bishop John R McGann has been regarded as a quiet man whose name when it appeared in the press at all was likely to be connected with fundraising for a charity or performing a nuptial mass But lately the 62yearold Bishop has been far more visible  and controversial In December 1985 he led nearly 4000 protesters in a march on the Hempstead abortion clinic operated for 20 years by Bill Baird the advcoate of birth control and abortion rights Last January he issued a pastoral letter strongly advocating lowercost housing on the Island  putting him at odds with homeowners who fear for the value of their property and the stability of their neighborhoods Bishop McGann has also been speaking out with new vehemence on a range of other issues as well from supporting the rights of Salvadoran refugees to opposing the use of condoms as a way to prevent the spread of AIDS In a recent interview however Bishop McGann said I dont think that Ive really changed Its the situation that has changed thats called for different forms of action Raised in Brooklyn He acknowledged too that he had been influenced by the example of John Cardinal OConnor in Manhattan a religious authority who he said favored a more activist approach Bishop McGann is very much a New York native He was raised in Brooklyn one of seven children His father a banker died in 1937 Bishop McGann said that from an early age he headed toward the priesthood and after ordination his entire career has been spent in Nassau and Suffolk Counties When the Diocese of Rockville Centre was established in 1957 it served 500000 Catholics That number has grown to 13 million  fully half the Islands population ranking it among the largest in the country Catholics are also a major political force The two county political leaders Thomas J Gulotta and Michael A LoGrande are Catholics as were their predecessors Francis T Purcell and Peter F Cohalan Leader of Protesters Within this framework Bishop McGann has by no means been a maverick He said he could think of no question about which he disagreed with either the church in general or Cardinal OConnor The fight against abortion is not a new priority for him either But he surprised many people when he led protesters  many of them carrying signs inscribed with such slogans as Babies Put to Death Here  to the Hempstead clinic The march was held Dec 28 on the Feast of the Holy Innocents the holiday commemorating the New Testament account of King Herods slaughter of male babies after the birth of Jesus Mr Baird who describes himself as a practicing Unitarian called the comparison intentionally inflamatory It encourages retribution he said To say that those of us who believe in abortion rights are equivalent to King Herod slaughtering babies has got to incite people and it puts me my family my staff and our patients in danger Target of Criticism The Baird clinic he noted was firebombed several years earlier and I didnt hear the Bishop condemning that Bishop McGann countered that he has consistently condemned the use of violence in the fight against abortion However another critic Rabbi Balfour Brickner senior rabbi of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Manhattan and an abortionrights advocate argued that along with other church leaders Bishop McGann has not really stressed to the public that bombing clinics is wrong Last month Rabbi Brickner said a man accused of bombing an abortion clinic Dennis J Malvasi turned himself in to the New York City police after an appeal from Cardinal OConnor But would a man so obedient to the church have carried out bombings in the first place if it had been communicated to him clearly that such activity is wrong the Rabbi asked Stand on Housing Bishop McGann responded by saying it would be obvious to anyone who was listening and rational that causing someone to bomb a clinic is the last thing we want to do While the Bishops stand on abortion  one that he has continued to press strenuously  draws fire from liberals his campaign for more housing for the elderly the handicapped the poor and the young angers some conservatives The need for such housing is acknowledged by almost all political leaders in Nassau and Suffolk Yet virtually every time a project is proposed there is a wave of local opposition ostensibly for such reasons as the plan would change the character of the community or diminish the value of neighboring properties Bishop McGann contends that neither of those outcomes is necessary and that a serious moral problem arises when people close their doors to those who are different or less fortunate He has called for new zoning regulations that would permit existing houses to be used by two families Reaction by Business Group This would help just about everyone he said It could be a source of income for older people who own the houses It would provide less expensive shelter for younger people who now have nowhere they can live on Long Island And it would mean greater interaction between the young and old a benefit in itself The Bishops statements on housing according to James L Larocca president of the Long Island Association a business group have helped immeasurably in focusing on a critical problem and how it effects everybody in Nassau and Suffolk Bishop McGann is also encouraging his parishes to offer assistance to the many thousands of Salvadorans living on Long Island as illegal aliens The Government argues that they are not really political exiles he said But the fact is their lives are in danger if they go home We Should Talk About Chastity Yet another issue about which he has been vocal are proposals to distribute condoms in schools as a way to thwart the spread of AIDS Im very much opposed to that he said It sends the wrong message to kids The right approach is education We should talk about chastity Rabbi Brickner commented that you might as well whistle in the wind The United States Surgeon General he noted has just about commanded people to use condoms and this has nothing to do with birth control I dont see how any religionist can say no to this Rabbi Brickner said Its a matter of protecting peoples lives people who have been born Bishop McGann said he was well aware that the forceful expression of his views was bound to cause friction Some people would like priests to stay in church and say their prayers and do nothing else he said But its just as much our job to speak out for what we believe is right Are we going to win I dont know I do hope well have some effect

AIDS TEST FOR WOMEN URGED BEFORE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/25/us/aids-test-for-women-urged-before-pregnancy.html,Any woman who wants to have a baby should voluntarily be tested for AIDS infection before becoming pregnant Surgeon General C Everett Koop said today Dr Koops advice which represented his personal opinion rather than Federal policy came in a questionandanswer period at the National Press Club in which he was asked about proposals for mandatory AIDS virus testing for people applying for marriage licenses I cant understand why it is so controversial he said adding that I would think anybody who is getting married today would want to be tested and would want to know whether the intended spouse was infected with the AIDS virus One of the greatest concerns he said was the potential threat to the babies of infected mothers The virus can pass from mother to infant in the womb I think no woman should contemplate a pregnancy without voluntarily wanting to be tested for the AIDS virus Dr Koop said Asked About Abortion Option Dr Koop a strong opponent of abortion answered cautiously when asked whether abortion was an option for a woman who discovered she had the AIDS virus after becoming pregnant If you wanted to give her all the possibilities that were available to her you would have to mention abortion he said Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction in which the bodys immune system becomes unable to resist disease There is no known cure and some 18000 Americans most of them homosexual men or intravenous drug users have died of it The virus spreads through sexual intercourse with an infected partner and in the exchange of blood as on shared hypodermic needles At a recent Federal conference of 800 AIDS experts in Atlanta participants rejected mandatory screening for AIDS infection of marriage license applicants arguing that this would detect few virus carriers and be an unwarranted infringement on civil liberties Voluntary Testing Urged Many experts called instead for encouragement of voluntary testing among women who plan to have children and are at special risk of AIDS virus infection These include in particular women who have used illegal intravenous drugs or have had sex partners who used intravenous drugs or women who have had sexual intercourse with a bisexual male Except among groups where drug use is common AIDS virus infection of women is extremely rare available evidence indicates In an effort to obtain more data about the spread of the AIDS virus Dr Koop said that he favored broader use of anonymous testing to encourage wider use of the test What we need is to be able to see a crosssection of all people in this country he said perhaps by more systematically testing anonymous blood samples from hospital patients The Federal Centers for Disease Control are now doing this with samples from a handful of hospitals around the country Asked his reaction to critics who have said President Reagan should be speaking out about AIDS Dr Koop said I think he thinks Im doing it and I am The President is kept informed constantly of everything the Public Health Service does Homosexuality in Soviet Union MOSCOW March 24 AP  A Communist newspaper for young people says homosexuality is on the increase in the Soviet Union and asserts it should continue to be treated as a crime to prevent the spread of AIDS Moskovsky Komsomolets the official paper of the Communist Partys Komsomol youth league gave no estimate of the number of homosexuals The report on homosexuality was a rare disclosure for the Soviet media and an apparent example of the policy of the Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev on openness concerning social problems But the report held fast to established Soviet policy maintaining homosexuality can be eradicated with education and upbringing
"IN CLASSROOM'S NEW ALPHABET LESSON, 'A' IS FOR AIDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/26/nyregion/in-classroom-s-new-alphabet-lesson-a-is-for-aids.html,Between lessons in mathematics and reading the sixth graders at the Chancellor Avenue School here turned their attention to the blackboard and the words drugs needles and homosexuals Were going to learn about some very big words today said the teacher Janet Christman Acquired immune deficiency syndrome Ms Christman then asked her pupils to describe everything they had heard about the disease I heard you can get it from toilet seats one boy said Then other children added that they had heard that AIDS could be contracted from being overweight by being bitten by an animal and through social contact with carriers of the virus Using Direct Language Were going to separate fact from fiction Ms Christman said And in direct language the class went on to discuss the definitions of heterosexual homosexual bisexual and intravenous drug user and the risks for each category Throughout the New York region many schools are beginning to teach about AIDS its transmission and methods of prevention By this fall every school district in New York New Jersey and Connecticut will have state guidelines on teaching about AIDS Were dealing with a serious epidemic and students need to know the facts to protect themselves said Jane De Maio New Jerseys school healtheducation specialist About 113 of the 30000 reported cases of AIDS in the United States have occurred among teenagers according to Federal health records Any education about AIDS is necessarily sex education and such instruction almost inevitably addresses condoms as a means of preventing transmission of the disease So far there has been little resistance to such classroom discussion educators and health experts said In New Jersey for example where parents can require that their children be exempted from sexeducation classes less than 1 percent have done so What might have seemed controversial instruction a year or two ago educators say has become much more accepted as the disease has become more widespread and as health leaders including the Surgeon General have strongly urged that children learn the facts about the disease Moroever virtually every AIDS education program stresses that abstinence is the surest way to avoid the disease In Irvington a school district considered by health experts to be a leader in sex education instruction about AIDS as well as other sexually transmitted diseases begins in the fourth grade Illustrations of condoms with an explanation of their use and purpose appear in a fourthgrade workbook In the fourth grade 90 percent of the kids arent yet interested in sex said Claire Sholz the district psychologist Then why bring up the subject so early some people ask Because of the other 10 percent she replies With so much talk about AIDS by news organizations and at home health experts said many children have become so worried that there has developed an AIDS hysteria syndrome Educators say anxieties about AIDS among children compel the schools to warn children about the real risks and also reassure them with the truth In the Scarsdale NY school district instruction about sexually transmitted disease starts in the sixth grade Like many other school districts every Scarsdale teacher has been required to attend a workshop on AIDS given by doctors and other health experts Further instruction about AIDS is not confined to health classes In science courses students learn about the virus that causes AIDS and social studies classes often focus on the issues in the public debate over the housing and job rights of sufferers of the disease Advised to Say No Education about the disease can begin in kindergarten even without using the word AIDS said Arlene H Sheffield director of school health demonstrations for New York State You gradually build up until youre talking about transmission and prevention For the older students she said teachers promote the theme Say no to drugs say no to alcohol say no to sexual intercourse In New York New Jersey and Connecticut AIDS instructional guidelines are being drafted by task forces that include educators health experts psychologists parents and clergy The guidelines will suggest books and videotapes as well as sample test questions A draft of the Connecticut guideline for example asks Should people with AIDS be quarantined and If you found out that an acquaintance of yours had AIDS would your feelings about himher change Delay in Sexual Activity Although it is too early to tell many educators believe that the schools increased focus on AIDS and other diseases has prompted many students to delay becoming sexually active Many adults who were myriadly promiscuous are now changing their ways because of what were finding out said Ms Sholz of the Irvington schools Why should the kids be any different Except for children in the very early grades educators said it is the rare youngster who has not heard about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases And students are rarely bashful they said about coeducational classroom discussions that cover topics from masturbation to abortion They can hear these things on the Saturday morning television Ms Sholz said The days have long passed when you could tell a child that a baby comes from a stork
4 G.O.P. HOPEFULS QUESTIONED GENTLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/28/us/4-gop-hopefuls-questioned-gently.html,Four prospective Republican Presidential candidates offered their visions of the future yesterday and answered gentle questions from a partisan audience about 125 Republican members of the House of Representatives their families and staff members The four hopefuls  Vice President Bush Representative Jack F Kemp former Gov Pierre S du Pont 4th and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  appeared not in Iowa or New Hampshire but at the Marriot Hotel in Times Square the headquarters of a threeday Republican Congressional excursion whose stated purpose is to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution Except for Mr Bush the candidates devoted little attention to President Reagan and only Mr Rumsfeld mentioned the Irancontra affair that has plagued the Administration for months Criticism of Gorbachev Mr Rumsfeld now an Illinois business executive said that there had been five national security advisers to the President in the last six years and added That probably is the single biggest reason why the country will spend the next 12 months traumatizing itself on this Irancontra affair Mr Bush in response to one of 16 congressmen who rushed to floor microphones to question him said that the loosening of restrictions on emigration by the Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev was a pittance and show biz Mr Bush said there had been some decentralization of the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union but that in other respects nothing has changed He also said that his loyalty to the President while producing hits from critics also gave him entree to the Oval Office I even got Don Regan to open the door for me he said drawing one of the few laughs at the threehour session Mr Regan resigned under pressure as White House chief of staff last month Abortion Issue Asked what criteria he might use in the selection of a vice president Mr Bush also drew a laugh when he said I havent chosen her yet Mr Kemp made an impassioned appeal against abortion which was greeted by silence from his audience He compared the issue to slavery and said it goes to the heart of the JudeoChristian reverence for life He called for the appointment of judges who respect human life and the passage of legislation to explicitly include the unborn in the definition of human life Although the session was held on Mr Kemps home turf Mr Bush drew the most enthusiastic reception and was even introduced by one of Mr Kemps New York colleagues Representatiuve Guy Molinari of Staten Island Mr Molinari is among nine of the states 13 Republican congressmen who have endorsed Mr Bush Questions Longer Than Answers Mr du Pont vied with Mr Kemp on the right end of the politial spectrum as he called for more private schools to provide competitioin for public schools the ending of farm subsidies the development of private retirement programs to head off a Social Security crisis early in the next century and mandatory work for ablebodied men on welfare Except for Mr du Ponts suggestions and Mr Kemps outspoken antiabortion position differences among the candidates were largely matters of shadings Each spoke for about 15 minutes then fielded questions from the House members for another 25 minutes The questions were often longer than the answers Bob Dole the Senate minority leader was also scheduled to speak but cancelled at the last minute because of pressing business on Capitol Hill Representgative E Clay Shaw Jr of Florida explained the Senators absence and said he could read a speech that Mr Dole had prepared But commenting on his ability to read a speech Mr Shaw said Ill spare you great pain Alexander Haig the former White House chief of staff who declared his Presidential candidacy earlier this week is scheduled to speak today He and Mr du Pont are the only declared candidates for the Republican nomination
Photo of John W. Matthews (NYT)POLITICS; NASSAU DEMOCRATS SET GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/nyregion/photo-of-john-w-matthews-nyt-politics-nassau-democrats-set-goals.html,NASSAU COUNTY regularly produces the largest vote of any county in the state but while its Republican Party is considered very strong its Democratic Party is viewed by politicians as one of the weakest in the state The weakness has been a chronic condition since the 1960s era of John F English then the Democratic County leader and now a prominent Mineola lawyer and Eugene H Nickerson then the first and only Democratic County Executive and now a Federal judge whose wife Marie Louise is one of the few Democrats on the Nassau County bench She is a District Court judge Capture of the county executive office with its vast patronage and access to contributions would solve many of the Democratic problems but in the meantime the new Democratic county leader John W Matthews is attempting to put the party on its feet financially Mr Matthews believes that money is the key to enlisting attractive candidates and winning elections and as a result he is spending considerable time at a task most polticians dislike  raising funds He is starting from ground zero The Nassau Democratic Party is 33000 in debt Mr Matthews said Its last paid worker left 10 days ago and has not been replaced The rent for the county headquarters at 22 Jericho Turnpike in Mineola has doubled and as a result Mr Matthews is looking for new cheaper quarters The headquarters tells much about the party fortunes in recent years In the English era the Democrats owned their own spacious building in Mineola But the party mortgaged it in 1970 to finance the county executive campaign of Andrew Di Paola now a State Supreme Court justice Eventually the party could no longer afford the mortgage payments sold the building and moved into rented headquarters which it now cannot afford The 49yearold Mr Matthews who owns the Island Insulation Company in Hempstead with about 20 employees spends almost every afternoon at party headquarters Last week he was on the telephone almost nonstop raising funds He is being helped on a volunteer basis by Carol Berman the former State Senator who has a record of major fund raising in the Five Towns area Mr Matthews said he had appealed to Governor Cuomo and other Democratic officials including United States Representative Robert J Mrazek whose district includes part of Suffolk County and northern Nassau County to give him access to their contributors who reside in Nassau County one of the most affluent counties in the nation There are a lot of Democrats taking money from this county he said Im not just using the phone book he said referring to his fundraising efforts with other politicians lists The party has scheduled its annual fundraising dinner at 160 a plate for June 10 Mr Matthews believes that the fund raising is the first step toward attracting strong candidates this year in three critical special elections for Nassau County executive Hempstead Town presiding supervisor and Oyster Bay town supervisor Nassau County Executive Thomas S Gulotta and Hempstead Town Presiding Supervisor Joseph N Mondello who is also the Nassau Republican chairman are interim shortterm incumbents rather than the wellentrenched Republican incumbents Nassau Democrats usually face Oyster Bay Supervisor Joseph Colby has decided not to seek reelection as county and Federal investigators scrutinize his administration Thus there will be no Republican incumbent in Oyster Bay either Mr Matthews said that Mr Gulotta and Mr Mondello were untested in their present positions and that Democrats hope to capitalize on what he called the arrogance of Mr Mondello in recommending himself for the presiding supervisor post The Democratic leader who must face an election himself for a full twoyear term after the September primary said he hoped to attract such candidates as Richard M Kessel executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board and Assemblyman Lewis J Yevoli for the upcoming elections While concentrating on money and candidates Mr Matthews a liberal Democrat has put aside the ideological differences that have weakened the Nassau Democratic Party and in the view of some Democrats made it unpalatable to generally moderate to conservative Nassau voters The ideological differences have nearly driven out of the party its most successful vote getter Nassau District Attorney Denis E Dillon who has been considering a switch to the Republican Party because of criticism by fellow Democrats of his antiabortion position Mr Matthews said that one of his moves was to meet with Mr Dillon in an effort to obtain his views on ths party He said that at his request the District Attorney had recommended four former assistant district attorneys as potential candidates for various offices He said he hoped Mr Dillon would remain a Democrat Like many Long Islanders Mr Matthews was born and raised in Queens and he graduated from St Johns Preparatory School and College He comes from a family of police officers Im the first male member of the family who is not a police officer he said He was introduced to politics by a Long Beach neighbor the late Allard K Lowenstein who believed there was no reason to be on earth if you werent interested in politics Mr Matthews said Mr Matthews still lives in Long Beach with his wife Cathy and two grown children Mrs Matthews who manages a medical laboratory has also started a travel agency Mr Matthews knows all about losing and even about kamikaze candidacies He first ran for county clerk in 1970 when the Nassau Democratic Party was starting downhill He ran for Congress in 1978 and county executive in 1981 and 1985 He lost them all But the infectuously enthusiastic Mr Matthews was not discouraged I never thought of it as losing I always thought I got something accomplished he said He cited as one example his advocacy of public power for Long Island in 1978 That was my issue he said and now we have a Long Island Power Authority However it is still by no means certain that the authority will survive to take over the Long Island Lighting Company as its proponents advocate Mr Matthews has ruled himself out as a candidate this year Its my job now he said to prepare the way for other candidates
NO COUNTRY FOR RADICALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/books/no-country-for-radicals.html,VISIONS AND NIGHTMARES America After Reagan By Robert Lekachman 316 pp New York Macmillan Publishing Company 1995 ROBERT LEKACHMAN is an angry man His Jaccuse The freemarket ideology of the Reagan Administration is a cover for the trashing of what this country has achieved however imperfect in the way of social justice Conservatives of various stripes and their minstrel President have converted medical care decent housing and adequate education into so many    commodities available in quantities and qualities determined by income and wealth They have in effect liquidated a public interest in minimum levels of the essentials of existence for all Looking back and paraphrasing Malthus Mr Lekachman a professor of economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York writes at Great Society feasts places were set for almost everybody There were of course gaps and glitches typified by the deal [ Lyndon Johnson ] cut with health providers to permit them to rip off the Treasury in return for graciously refraining from sabotage of Medicare and Medicaid So two cheers for LBJ Under Ronald Reagan the author writes no god but that of the marketplace is worshiped yielding privatization militarization persistent unemployment deunionization middleclass shrinkage and the triumph of plutocracy Mr Lekachmans cases in point when backed by fact and figure make for an intelligently passionate brief against the Reagan Administration But he has two other purposes here polemic and prophecy and in pursuit of them he sometimes sounds like a man who has hired a hall PostReagan America will be a playground for the wealthy a mean society for the poor and vulnerable he writes The gap between poor and rich will continue to widen as it has since 1981    The gamut of respectable politics will range from moderately conservative to wildly reactionary Prayer will come back to public schools As it was before the Supreme Courts landmark decision safe abortion will become again a prerogative of prosperous women Policemen and soldiers will surge in general esteem Foreign policy will edge closer and closer to the Soviet model Perhaps But recent events not accounted for in this book include the likelihood that somewhere between Teheran Geneva and Managua somebody baked a cake with a pendulum in it and that pendulum appears already to have begun to swing However clairvoyant Mr Lekachmans visions and nightmares turn out to be there is much to be said for his acid critique of the here and now He is at his best on modern medicine In the new order customers choose health care products much as they shop for cars refrigerators and microwave ovens    Operating on conventional business principle profitmaking hospitals grab for larger market shares in competition with nonprofits by segmenting their customers For those who can afford them VIP suites and gourmet cuisine are available Elsewhere all available corners will be cut Mr Lekachman is not without hope for some form of revival of a coalition of forces dedicated to social justice as existed in varying degrees in the Roosevelt Truman and Johnson years though he hopes for little in the way of trumpet calls from the neoliberals currently ascendant in the Democratic Party That rational affectless breed he writes lacking any oldfashioned passion for social justice conjures with this and that version of industrial policy a definitionally promiscuous concept which in turn serves as a convenient metaphor for the general disarray of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party Similarly he takes on his own profession economics for being too prone to believe in the existence of technical solutions to intricate social and economic problems Other frequent targets here are neoconservative intellectuals yuppies corporate managers the prophets of privatizing social services from health care to law enforcement  all part of an America the author sees bewitched by the magic of selfenrichment blind to the commonweal But unlike other acerbic voices from the left for example John Kenneth Galbraith and Gore Vidal Mr Lekachman lacks the gifts of idiosyncratic irony and original wit though he attempts the forms from time to time that render their harpooning of their quarries not only an entertaining intellectual exercise but a moment of literary truth  whether or not we wind up buying their entire case Toward the end of the book Mr Lekachman himself asks Have I been excessively lugubrious Too many of his pages are devoted to scorching what he sees as a political wasteland while offering little in the way of fresh seed but rhetorical asides and laments Thus If only Franklin Roosevelt comparatively blessed be his memory had had the guts in 1935 to take on organized medicine and fight for the comprehensive healthcare provisions that his Committee on Economic Security sought to include in the Social Security Act Along the way Mr Lekachman does spin out an entertaining scenario for neoliberalism in action less a nightmare than a recipe for uneasy sleep in the form of a Gary Hart administration complete with Cabinet appointments Felix Rohatyn to Treasury Representative Stephen J Solarz Democrat of New York to State and concludes the book with an overtakenbyevents pitch for Governor Cuomo an astute political moralist who could steal the rhetoric of family church and country from the Republican Party But is his heart in such exercises I suspect not rather they take second place to his sorrow that as the liberal political theorist Louis Hartz and others have written America  lacking a revolutionary tradition on the European plan that includes the overthrow of feudalism  has no place for truly radical action for Socialism A somber realism is the strength of Visions and Nightmares and it is on that note that Robert Lekachman concludes Finally leftwing populists confront as their most severe political obstacle the sense among their natural constituents that politics change nothing important An angry man a provocative thoughtful but uneven book REAGAN NEVER SURRENDERED Can [ the ] left rise again It might be more accurate to phrase the question simply Can the left rise for the first time as a political winner at the national level    Consider that former loser Ronald Reagan He launched his presidential campaign in 1964 when he delivered a famous speech in flaming support of Barry Goldwater whose premature Reaganism was as soundly thrashed by Lyndon Johnson as George McGovern and Walter Mondale were beaten by Richard Nixon and the finally triumphant Ronald Reagan For sixteen years Reagan held firm to a set of principles that in the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s were derided as those of the kooky far right Kooky or not to an astonishing degree the public has come to accept these very articles of Reagan faith as conventional political wisdom Democrats who dream of regaining the White House by imitating Republicans delude themselves From Visions and Nightmares
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/magazine/no-headline-326687.html,ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE THE final week of the Baby M trial in New Jersey I went to visit Noel Keane the lawyer who had arranged the contested contract in that case He was doing business as usual which meant that his comfortable twostory offices in Dearborn Mich were full of prospective surrogate mothers often with husbands and babies in tow and infertile couples who had come to check out the candidates for surrogacy The wellgroomed couples who had come from as far away as New York and Texas were each assigned a private office through which the surrogates were rotated to proffer their fertility and show off the living gurgling proof thereof I watched them come and go the surrogates young women dressed to please They would return from the interviews either hopeful or dejected depending on what had happened their husbands or boyfriends mimicking their moods or giving them pep talks Just look at her would you look at her said one young man smiling at his pretty young girlfriend and their outofwedlock eightmonthold Her stomach was that flat the day she left the hospital and she doesnt have a stretch mark on her Ill take care of her when shes pregnant again but the baby means absolutely nothing Its like watching someones car for nine months Were in it for the money its a business Thats the way we look at it On the heels of the surrogates Noel Keane or his female assistant would slip quietly in to confer with the couples to see if any matches were in the offing This was they told me an uncharacteristically slow morning One wouldbe surrogate was perhaps a bit too jazzy another a bit backwoodsy as one of the couples described her while a third  divorced with two children and a job at Dunkin Donuts seemed a little withdrawn and a little too apparently lonesome There was that morning however one promising candidate Everyone sensed it when she came in Pretty and poised 24yearold Lisa Spoor is the daughter of a lawyer the divorced mother of two and a waitress who earns 8000 a year She wants the 10000 surrogate fee so she can send her two small children to private school Noel Keane tracked her progress through the rooms Whatd you think of her he would ask subtly pressuring the couples not to dally in deciding or she would be snapped up She quickly was by a couple from New York Gregory and Kathleen Zaccaria young professionals in their 30s with a joint annual income of 100000 They will pay 10000 for Lisa Spoors services  the money to be held in escrow until she turns over the baby They will pay 10000 for Noel Keanes services and another 5000 for Lisa Spoors insurance medical bills and maternity clothes The contract holds the father liable if the baby is born with genetic defects The Zaccarias and Lisa Spoor agreed that she will have an abortion if her life is in danger or if the fetus is abnormal As they filled out the preliminary papers after a 45minute interview their faces flushed it was hard not to feel their excitement also hard not to note that the differential between their family incomes is 92000 a year The subject that hung over Noel Keanes offices was of course Mary Beth Whitehead the 29yearold surrogate with second thoughts who was now not only trying to get her baby back but also suing Noel Keane for not counseling her adequately Her name her face  that prettytough young face aged by an overdarkened heavy hairdo and no doubt by pain  haunted Noel Keanes place causing each of the prospective surrogates to announce proudly and emphatically that she would never do that never try to keep her baby that she was of better more honorable stuff I wont have a problem Lisa Spoor told me Im doing it for the money number one but also to help somebody I just wont be with the baby right after the birth because thats when you bond and I dont want to do that That woman disgusts me another of the aspiring surrogates said of Mary Beth Whitehead She shouldnt have came through here in the first place Nobody much would disagree with that certainly not Mary Beth Whitehead herself or William and Elizabeth Stern the father and wouldbe adoptive mother of Baby M or Noel Keane who admits he does minimal presignup screening of the surrogates  some he never even meets before these Saturday morning matchups Noel Keane whose surrogate practice grossed 600000 last year also admits that the surrogatecouple contract he wrote probably wont be enforceable in the Baby M trial in which the family court judges main responsibiltiy is to determine what is in the best interest of the child Judge Harvey R Sorkow who is expected to rule in the case tomorrow can throw out the contract and still give custody to the Sterns who have had the baby for the past eight months He can also uphold the contract yet give Baby M back to Mary Beth Whitehead who had her for the first four months of her life Its all up for grabs which means that Gregory and Kathleen Zaccaria and their surrogate Lisa Spoor are now entering the same legal limbo land in which the Sterns and Whiteheads have been writhing in that courtroom in New Jersey So just who is Noel Keane Is he a purveyor of joy or a purveyor of pain Is he as he would have you believe a goodhearted man intent on filling the cradles of the infertile or a deceptively softspoken highpaid agent with wombs for rent WHEN I FIRST HEARD about surrogate mothering in the late 1970s I thought it was just fine noble even an act of sisterhood probably the ultimate act By that time a lot of women of my generation were having trouble having babies also having trouble finding babies they wished to adopt Prodded by loneliness and husbands who wished to father they were susceptible to the idea of borrowing another woman to do what they could not Surrogacy didnt seem weird or ugly or mean or any of that in fact it had an aura of sweetness of sharing Did my sympathies presage my own infertility Perhaps thats a bit of fatalistic mumbo jumbo the same kind of fatalism that made me shake my head knowingly when in 1984 at the age of 34 I awoke from a simple diagnostic surgical procedure to be told I might never have the children Id finally decided I badly wanted The diagnosis seemed more like a judgment an apt if wounding retribution for having flouted time for having devalued motherhood by waiting too long to try it for putting other things  namely work  first I had known all along that the incidence of infertility went up with age Did I with the arrogance of a cigarette smoker just assume I would be the one to beat the statistics to live  or in my case give life  in defiance of the increasingly lousy odds No doubt I did Blessed with love with work I loved and a husband who had waited patiently for me to want children I now stared at the years ahead with a lonely shudder Still it never occurred to me to try to find a surrogate mother not out of moral objections at that point more out of ego the sense that I didnt want to raise a child who would be forever biologically linked to my husband and another woman by an act that felt a little too much like conceptual adultery But when I first read about William and Elizabeth Stern I did not begrudge them their decision knowing that infertility has its own often desperate momentum even knowing as I did that Elizabeth Stern  now 41  was not de facto infertile but has multiple sclerosis which childbearing might exacerbate She had waited too long too right through her medical education and residency in pediatrics only to end up with an infirmity that made her tremulous about pregnancy Admittedly I would have been happier it would have been cleaner from a conscience point of view had Elizabeth Stern been flatout infertile But I still found it easier to forgive her her timidity than to countenance the frenzied flipflop of her surrogate It was Mary Beth Whitehead who was now wreaking havoc with the lives of decent people  not only the Sterns but her own family too her husband Richard and their children Ryan and Tuesday not to mention Baby M herself How dare Mary Beth Whitehead do this How dare she now renege causing all this fuss all this emotional mess Five hundred surrogates in this country had already signed on and yielded up their babies as promised Why couldnt Mary Beth Whitehead simply do the same Why did she have to open the whole thing up All the women I know and love or talk to or overhear have been vitriolic defensive ugly and empassioned about Baby Ms fate as if she were their own I misspeak Thats not really what theyre concerned about not Baby M herself but what that M stands for Motherhood pure and simple or pure and complicated Our fascination with Baby M is in fact our fascination with ourselves with our own notions of being a mother a parent what it means how important it is how to do it who should do it who should not and whether its OK to have a baby for someone else or whether doing that violates something fundamental Underneath it always for women are the questions Could I do that could I have a baby and give it away Or vice versa could I pay someone to have a baby for me and then raise him or her as my own Could I myself do that These questions have torn at people in a way few issues have in years Why Maybe in a sense its the personal analog the microcosmic analog of the nuclear question Impersonal procreation and impersonal destruction  do they go hand in hand The passion generated by the Baby M case is so intense that it must connect to some deep life threat we all feel some sense that were approaching a dangerous border or have already crossed it and cannot turn back some sense that in our hubris we have tempted fate or the gods and will somehow pay IN THE WEEKS BEFORE I actually attended the Baby M trial I listened to the women around me trying to reckon with it as I was From some of them I heard rage at Mary Beth Whitehead for not acting like a grownup for acting like a flighty female for reneging on a contract and for insisting on the primacy of the biological mother over the adoptive mother Just as quickly and just as assertively came the probirthmother backlash liberal liberated women decrying the treatment of Mary Beth Whitehead as class snobbery some of them extolling the wonder and importance of the bond between mother  make that natural mother  and child I also heard rage hurled at Elizabeth Stern heard her characterized as a pampered pediatrician who didnt want a baby badly enough to have one but badly enough to try to buy one Her defenders on the other hand were saying she had acted honorably in deference to medical risks in deference to her husbands wishes to father and in deference to the contract they then entered into Mary Beth Whitehead and Elizabeth Stern are a conscience call for other women theyre like two sides of a folding mirror in which we see reflected ourselves our choices our histories our prejudices our privileges the spine of the mirror being the irrefutable gulf that both joins and separates them like Baby M herself The Roman Catholic Church also added its voice to the surrogacy debate recently by condemning all artificial forms of conception and in a major doctrinal statement calling for them to be outlawed I must admit I got jostled by all of this debate or awakened maybe so that the questions about surrogate mothering I had simply repressed came bubbling up Leaving aside the surrogate herself what about her husband who watches his wife grow large with another mans child And what about the surrogates own children who will see their halfsibling given away at birth And what about the babies themselves destined to know at some point that they were brought into the world to be given away    for money I was further jogged by an encounter with another surrogate with second thoughts a pretty California blonde named Nancy Barrass who is contemplating filing a lawsuit similar to Mary Beth Whiteheads As we sat in a San Francisco aiport lounge heavy with smoke and impatience she quietly thumbed through a birth album of the son shed borne and surrendered shortly after birth six months earlier and for whom she palpably longed And yet in her tears there was something so unmaternal  so youthfully abashed was she at the pain she had caused herself She had meant to be unfazed meant to make her parents and friends proud of her generosity meant to make the couple she had had the baby for like her so much that afterwards she would be part of their extended family and could watch her son grow up But none of it not one piece of that had come out the right way Her parents were not particularly proud The couple did not want her around And she was not unattached from her son and clearly never would be She made me reconsider certainly but something more she shamed me made me think that what Id taken as the ultimate liberated act of generosity  having a baby for another woman was more like an act of biological betrayal that women had been encouraged to commit against themselves encouraged not just by the Noel Keanes of the world not just by the men who wanted children of their own sperm but by women like Elizabeth Stern and myself whose bodies would not do our bidding when we finally called upon them to do it We were implicated in this too I was so that when I finally saw Mary Beth Whitehead for the first time in court my heart to my own surprise had already started to lean in her direction even though she would turn out to be as difficult a heroine as ambiguous an object of affection or admiration as Elizabeth Stern SOMETIMES THEY look almost eerily alike Its not only the hair falling the same way and the bangs but the shapes of their faces and their high cheekbones made more prominent by their weight losses of the past year Both have good transforming smiles Mary Beth Whiteheads smile untightens her jaw and makes her look girlish again lighthearted while Elizabeth Sterns smile alleviates her primness Friends women with a common goal  they seemed to be that when Baby M was only an idea they shared and later during most of the pregnancy when they talked fairly regularly and the Sterns were nice to the Whitehead children Tuesday now 10 years old spent the night with the Sterns and went with them to the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade William Stern took Ryan now 12 and his dad to a Mets game William Stern and Mary Beth Whitehead drove together to New York from their homes in New Jersey several times a month for the inseminations though after she became pregnant he felt she withdrew from him and was much more comfortable with his wife In the popular retelling everything went along just fine until Mary Beth Whitehead gave birth and felt she couldnt give up the baby But even before the birth the surrogate mother had begun to resent Elizabeth Stern had begun to find their relationship cloying as Dr Stern seemed to appropriate the pregnancy doing things like calling Mrs Whiteheads doctor even recommending to him a certain drug the surrogate should take Mary Beth Whitehead her mother says was already pulling back at that point already wishing shed never gotten into this mess because she knew it was going to end badly She asked near the end of the pregnancy if she could visit the baby The Sterns now say they agreed as long as she did it anonymously in the guise of a friend or acquaintance Perhaps its hindsight but its hard to see how Mary Beth Whitehead and Elizabeth Stern could have ended up compatibly The problem between the women is not the worlds that separate them but some of the personality traits they have in common These are both strongminded women characterized in courtroom testimony and in the written custody evaluations as the forceful figures in their marriages women married to acquiescent men women with a firm conviction in their own judgment Elizabeth Sterns multiple sclerosis though later corroborated was originally selfdiagnosed and she never consulted a specialist about whether having a baby would worsen it Adoption was then ruled out without much exploration the assumption was that it would take too long and that there would be a problem because she and her husband were too old and of different religions Then there is Mary Beth Whitehead who decided at the age of 18 that she didnt want any more children She was all set to have a tubal ligation but hearing the surgical details opted out Her husband Richard had a vasectomy instead Nine years later she entered the surrogacy program having overcome his initial reservations  he thought it was a weird idea  then hugged to her breast the baby he was physically incapable of giving her And then he did everything in his power to help her hold onto the baby at one point even uprooting the family leaving his job and fleeing with Mary Beth and the baby to Florida where they hid out from the Sterns and the law for 87 days What sort of woman flees like that without seeking counsel with her whole family in tow  a woman so besotted by motherlove motherneed that she would put one child over the rest Because that is what she did And yet that flight above all the things Mary Beth Whitehead did is somehow viscerally comprehensible  not rational not wise and definitely not legal but comprehensible In his closing argument before the court Mary Beth Whiteheads own attorney said of his client The bottom line is that Mary Beth Whitehead is a mother and without that she has nothing in this life So is this the new feminist heroine I dont know its all getting turned around as am I increasingly queasy about surrogate mothering but also somewhat queasy I confess about the promotherhood backlash among women and the antimale quotient in that backlash At last we come to the father In all the endless talk about the Baby M case William Stern is the forgotten figure as if the battle for the baby were but a custody catfight between two women as if he were nothing more than a sperm donor Mary Beth Whitehead in fact continues to dismiss him as such calling him Mr Sperm It is her ultimate slur She even had the baby baptized at one point and listed Richard Whitehead as the father What shall we do with William Stern How shall we account for a fathers rights his responsibilities his love There is I think scarcely a woman on earth who does not believe that a mother has more organic understanding of right to and love for the child she carries for nine months Is this accurate or is it enduring gender snobbery or is it an effort to reclaim some home turf yielded to even thrust at  men in the heyday of the womens movement There is retrenchment here New inequities surfaced on top of the old the male world didnt quite respond as hoped it might be noted that of the 11 mental health experts to testify in the custody phase of the Baby M trial only two were women and some men are turning up after divorce not only with most of the money but with the children as well But this is not a divorce This is a new hybrid relationship thats come unglued one part of which is a man who deeply wanted to be a father to father his own child and raise that child a man who has no other blood relatives left on earth Leaving the surrogacy issue aside for a moment is something wrong with that impulse Ive heard William Stern accused of genetic narcissism of procreative machismo But there is nothing macho about William Stern in fact quite the contrary He seems to be the tenderest of the protagonists in this story a man who can cry quite easily at the idea of losing his daughter She is apparently equally attached to him her face lighting up when he comes in the room What do we do with that information The one thing that would be clearly tough is for Baby M to be shared It doesnt seem fair somehow to ask her to stretch her small body across the gulf of acrimony that separates these two families families who cant even agree on what to call her Either she will be Sara the name Mary Beth Whitehead baptized her with or she will be Melissa the name the Sterns gave her both families in a rather rueful coincidence having given her the middle name of Elizabeth BABY M HAD HER first birthday this past Friday March 27 and for all the contentious hubbub thats gone on around her she is described as a cheerful resilient baby The three evaluators appointed by Baby Ms legal guardian  as opposed to the ones hired by each side  unanimously urged that she remain where she is with the Sterns Two further urged that Mary Beth Whitehead not be given visitation rights for at least five years But the judge may terminate Mary Beth Whiteheads rights altogether which would mean she would have no legal standing as Baby Ms mother  including no right to bring future legal action  and no access to her It might also mean a couple of the experts warned that Baby M would later resent the parents whod cut her off from her birth mother a mother who fought to keep her and whom at some point given all the publicity in this case she will inevitably wish to know As someone who has not had a baby I can only use my empathic instincts such as they are to imagine the loss Mary Beth Whitehead faces I understand full well that there are plenty of women now the huge majority of surrogates who have to hear them tell it not suffered such a loss That I cannot imagine Nor can I imagine the women in my position who feel comfortable availing themselves of another womans fertility For women who have problems with childbearing having a baby is not just a mechanical decision anymore but a moral one and surrogacy for me I have finally concluded would not be a moral choice But I know there are a lot of infertile women out there who perhaps feel more keenly than I the wound of being childless in a childfilled world Would I stop them outlaw surrogacy per se I cant go that far The best that can probably come out of the Baby M case would be legislation and tougher regulations so the surrogate brokers would be liable for the Mary Beth Whiteheads they sign up and conversely the Mary Beth Whiteheads would be accountable to the contracts they sign That way everyone is on final notice as final as such notice can be At the end of the Baby M trial a doctor who had worked in the adoption field for many years testified in Mary Beth Whitheads behalf He testified that there was no way a woman could give her informed consent to part with her baby until after it was born Sometimes he said when they see their babies for the first time mothers just get caught and cant let go The convenient way to solve this problem is to anesthetize the natural mother and take the baby away before she ever sees it Is that more humane Would that have taken care of Mary Beth Whiteheads problem her longing Had she not been awake during Baby Ms birth had she not held her afterward or breastfed her maybe she would have been all right maybe she would have surrendered her to the Sterns as promised and there never would have been a Baby M trial at all There is no way to know that the one thing  maybe the only thing  that is clear is that surrogacy is no business for women who are going to go around falling in love with their own babies no business at all

ROBERTSON SHIFTS POLITICAL TACK IN BID TO STEER CLEAR OF EVANGELISTS' BATTLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/us/robertson-shifts-political-tack-in-bid-to-steer-clear-of-evangelists-battle.html,Pressing his crusade for the Presidency in New Hampshire the Rev Pat Robertson worked hard this week to keep a distance from the battle enveloping his fellow television evangelists At first Mr Robertson who despite minuscule poll ratings led the Republican field in early party tests in Michigan and South Carolina said the animosity among television evangelists was a prelude to an accelerating revival Then after a latenight huddle with aides Wednesday he began dismissing as an aberration the matter that provoked the divisiveness the sex scandal and shakeup at the Rev Jim Bakkers PTL television ministry When queried about the turmoil Mr Robertson would ask if the case of the journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for an article later found to be a fabrication meant all journalists were liars or if Ivan Boeskys transgressions meant all stock traders were shady Suited to Seculiar Audience His initial approach seemed to play well in the churches but the new one appeared to do better with secular audiences Changes in tack to match shifts in political winds are nothing new in the testing stages of political campaigns but in Mr Robertsons case there seemed a difference perhaps basic One approach came from the preacher the other from the politician for he is both He is a graduate of an Ivy League law school with a specialty in tax law His father A Willis Robertson a staunch Democrat served 14 years in the House of Representatives and 20 more in the Senate rising to chairman of the Banking Committee The candidate claims as ancestors two Presidents and a signer of the Declaration of Independence But he has never held elective office nor practiced law instead Mr Robertson who is also a seminary graduate and ordained minister has a television ministry that reaches 28 million Americans He is a Southern Baptist and a charismatic who says abortion has murdered 25 million babies that only the religious have the dedication to bring up children that those who argue that children are wards of the state are guilty of Naziism and that while parents are totally responsible for their children the children belong to God Campaign and Revival Like other candidates he passes out cards to potential supporters asking them to check blanks to contribute Time and effort Money or to Host a Home Party But Mr Robertsons cards have another blank Prayer In speeches sermons and interviews he reels off a barrage of statistics  on crime rates drug use AIDS unemployment divorce rates the national debt the projected Social Security shortfall  with the ease of a polished campaigner Sometimes as when he took the pulpit at the little Community Chapel of the Church of the Nazarene here in Nashua Thursday night he seems to be conducting both a political campaign and a religious revival The choir and congregation sang How Great Thou Art and God of Our Fathers which appeared in the hymnals and America the Beautiful and God Bless America which did not Parable of Free Enterprise Mr Robertson an easy softly handsome man of 57 with a ready smile and brown hair shot with gray was the subject of an exhaustive introduction A graduate of Washington and Lee University Yale University Law School and Biblical Seminary Holder of an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Oral Roberts University Founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network a 70 million enterprise Owner of three other stations bringing in an additional 30 million a year and a station in Lebanon on the Israeli border broadcasting in English and Arabic Founder and chancellor of CBN University with 944 students in five graduate programs and a law school And a great candidate for President of the United States The congregation applauded Television cameras flanked the pulpit their lights bathing the choir Mr Robertson said he often prayed for wisdom worldly and spiritual He said that if we believe that Jesus is God then every time He spoke it was a principle as valid as the law of gravity or the law of thermodynamics He then translated the parable of the talents into a tale of free enterprise in which the biblical entrepreneur rented a caravan of camels perhaps from the Hertz of the day and took to the path of commerce doubling his money and returning to his master the equivalent of 5 million Prospering vs the National Debt It was by applying the biblical principle of using ones talents Mr Robertson said that he himself turned a 70 investment in a dilapidated television station in 1959 into a Christian cable network that is now hooked into 34 million homes I had to buy a television station and I didnt even own a television set he said But while he was prospering by using his talents Mr Robertson went on America was on the wrong side of the exponential curve  instead of multiplying its wealth it fell 23 trillion in debt It will be 3 trillion by the year 1990 he said his voice rising and by the year 2000 if nothing is done it will be 13 trillion and interest alone will be in excess of our entire present Federal budget one trillion dollars But there is something else he said shifting easily from America in the year 2000 to Jamestown Va on April 29 1607 when he said the settlers landed on the shores of this ocuntry and their first official act was to plant a cross in the ground to kneel around that cross and say We dedicate this land to the glory of Almighty God  Religion in US History He quoted the opening line of the Mayflower Compact In the Name of God Amen and sprinkled in a number of other religious allusions and landmarks in American history concluding with the Declaration of Independence observing that an ancestor Benjamin Harrison signed it We hold certain truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal he said leaning heavily on the word created That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights Thats the foundation of the greatest nation on the face of the earth he said a belief in a Creator who gives us liberty Ladies and gentlemen the liberty that you have and I have in this wonderful land did not come from any government Government did not give it to us Government cant take it away from us Our rights as citizens come directly from the Creator Not from Washington Not from Concord not from any other city where people meet in legislative assembly It comes from Almighty God When people ask me if I believe in teaching creationism in schools he went on I ask them Do you believe in teaching the Constitution  Support Among Evangelicals Asked in an interview if he was suggesting a return to a theocracy that the Constitution specifically denies Mr Robertson replied A theocracy implies that the priests are running things which I dont believe is in any way appropriate but I do believe that we have clearly a theistic country whose institutions  and I quote Justice Douglas  whose institutions presuppose a supreme being I think our Declaration the Northwest Ordinance the Constitution itself the foundational documents of our country are tied in with religion and morality That view coupled with strong antiCommunism  he maintains that the primary goal of American foreign policy should be not containing Communism but eradicating it  have drawn fervent support among evangelical Christians His followers turned out in large enough numbers to seize the Republican Party machinery in Michigan and appear to be in a position to do so in South Carolina But such caucuses hinge far more on the fervor of a few than on mass appeal and it remains to be seen whether he can broaden his support or whether it is as some political analysts say a mile deep and a foot wide In a New York TimesCBS News Poll conducted by telephone Jan 1821 among 459 people likely to vote in Republican primaries Mr Robertson was favored by 5 percent The margin of samping error was plus or minus two percentage points Prospect of Caricature Seen And while Mr Robertson maintains that the fallout from the infighting among television evangelists over the PTL turmoil in no way affects him political analysts see damage to his campaign Absolutely  theres no way around it said Kevin Phillips the political analyst whose book The Coming Republican Majority foreshadowed the emergence of the religious right The fundamentalist evangelicals have had their heyday not so much in 1980 as in 1972 as well Nixon carried that vote 4 to 1 even before it had emerged as a focal point Mr Phillips compares the present situation to the 1920s when Sinclair Lewis produced the fictional prototype in Elmer Gantry and the revivalist Aimee Semple McPherson created a scandal of her own in Los Angeles The whole evangelicalfundamentalist movement becomes a caricature he said But Mr Phillips added that while he felt that Mr Robertson was bound to be put on the defensive by the PTL turmoil the connection was not necessarily fair And he said that before the PTL shakeup there was evidence of growing grassroots support for his campaign

CARDINAL EASES THREAT TO CURB FOSTER SERVICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/30/nyregion/cardinal-eases-threat-to-curb-foster-services.html,John Cardinal OConnor yesterday set aside his threat to withdraw Roman Catholic fostercare services this summer from 2500 New York City youngsters He had said late last year that he would discontinue group foster care provided by church agencies because of a Federal court requirement that birth control and abortion services be provided to teenagers Instead of halting foster care after contracts with the city expire on June 30 the Cardinal said he will test the disputed requirement in Federal court While awaiting the courts decision he added he will not countenance the use of family planning services Our Catholic principles still stand he said The announcement by the Cardinal who is the head of the Archdiocese of New York lifts a cloud over the citys already overburdened fostercare system System Is Now Overburdened The system has experienced a surge in the number of youngsters who need care  there are now some 17500 Stories abound of children who were removed from their homes because of neglect or abuse being shuttled from building to building in search of a bed for the night The Cardinals talk of withdrawal had threatened to make the situation worse Im delighted hes appealing Mayor Koch said when told of the Cardinals decision What is important to me is that they stay in the system If they can get relief in the court hosanna to the Highest Cardinal OConnor however still held out the possibility of withdrawal from the system if the archdiocese loses the appeal If the day comes that the requirement is that to receive a contract we must violate our Catholic principles then we will not accept any city contracts he said The Cardinal who returned Friday from a visit to Rome made the announcement in a brief news conference after mass at St Patricks Cathedral He was in Rome as part of a delegation of American Roman Catholic leaders who met with Pope John Paul II to discuss the pontiffs planned trip in September to the United States More than any other major city New York is almost wholly dependent on nongovernmental agencies for foster care Fiftyseven agencies including those of the archdiocese provide the services under contracts that cost the public more than 100 million a year The relationship between the agencies and the city has come under sharp attack as a result of a lawsuit filed in 1973 by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a 13yearold black Protestant child in foster care Shirley Wilder The suit charged that because of her race and religion the services she received were not equal to those available to some other children in the system In a settlement of the suit made final last month in Federal District Court the city agreed to set up new standards that would apply across the board to all group fostercare homes and institutions These are places in which a small number of youngsters usually teenagers live together under adult supervision Not Every Child Affected The settlement worked out under Judge Robert J Ward did not affect the more traditional fostercare setting in which children live separately with families who receive a stipend for expenses Among the provisions of the settlement is one requiring that all children be given meaningful access to family planning services including contraception and abortion In the last six months as the settlement was being worked out Cardinal OConnor warned that he would withdraw from the system when the city contracts expired rather than comply Decision Followed Consultations In response to a question yesterday the Cardinal said he had changed his mind and decided to appeal after consulting with the heads of the Catholic agencies and with lawyers for the archdiocese They felt he said that it would be foolish for us not to test it in the courts before making the definitive step to withdraw In trying to overturn the settlement the archdiocese is joining the agencies of the United Jewish AppealFederation of Jewish Philanthropies which earlier this month announced its decision to appeal The Jewish agencies object to another part of the settlement one that would take away their discretion in admitting only those cases they choose and believe they can help
BURST OF DISCOVERIES REVEALS GENETIC BASIS FOR MANY DISEASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/31/science/burst-of-discoveries-reveals-genetic-basis-for-many-diseases.html,GENETIC defects that contribute to important human diseases are being discovered at a remarkable and accelerating pace Within the past year scientists found the abnormal genes responsible for Duchennes muscular dystrophy a wasting muscle disease retinoblastoma a cancer of the eyes and chronic granulomatous disease a disorder that leads to multiple serious infections and used to be uniformly fatal Just in the past few months important clues have been found to different genetic defects in some patients who suffer from common mental disorders Alzheimers disease and manicdepressive illness Similar genetic clues called markers have also been found recently for several other less familiar diseases The roster of genetic discoveries expands greatly if the accomplishments of the past several years are included Scientists have found the approximate locations of the genetic defects of cystic fibrosis Huntingtons disease polycystic kidney disease and many others and are closing in on the actual identities of the genes themselves In some cases the discoveries have made it possible to identify healthy carriers of the disease trait who could pass it on to their children or to make prenatal diagnoses of the condition particularly if someone in the family already has the disease More such predictive tests are expected from the current research but the scientific achievements are so new that many of the potential applications have not yet been achieved These are triumphs of science but they do not imply quick conquests of the diseases Just the ability to do presymptomatic diagnostic testing for this whole range of inherited diseases will be very useful said Dr Helen DonisKeller an expert in this kind of study It will give choices that were never possible before Sheheads human genetics studies at Collaborative Research Inc a biotechnology company in Massachusetts Doctors who treat patients who have genetic disorders speak commonly these days of parents who had given up the hope of having more children after seeing a child die after a few years of tortured life Now in many cases if the couple does not have moral objections to abortion they can try again bearing the fetus if tests show it does not carry the defect but confident that the defect can be detected early if it is present However as that example illustrates the growing ability to identify and analyze genes will also raise new dilemmas and controversies of which the abortion debate is an important one There is also the problem of what to do with a test that predicts that a person will develop a fatal genetic disease when no treatment exists for the disorder and the reliability of the test is less than perfect In the future some scientists believe aboveaverage susceptibility to major disorders such as heart disease and forms of mental illness will become identifiable through genetic tests Although this has the potential of being of great value to the individual such predictive ability could also invite serious invasions of privacy by government agencies insurers and employers The recent discoveries spanning a wide range of disease types are highlighting the importance of genetic predisposition or susceptibility to many kinds of illness The fact that disease often results from an unfavorable conjunction of both hereditary and nonhereditary factors has long been known But environmental effects such as infection improper diet or imprudent life style have usually been emphasized because these factors were easier to understand and remedy Today some emphasis is shifting back to heredity new research is clarifying its role and promises to do so even more in the future The ultimate goal is total understanding of the diseases and their prevention or cure But although the revolution in biology is advancing almost explosively it is still in its early stages Few experts expect conquest to follow closely after discovery even though the pace of scientific advance is far faster today than it has ever been before In recent years most of the research on genetic diseases has centered on disorders already known to be wholly hereditary and usually based on one or another single defective gene The discoveries concerning Alzheimers disease and manicdepressive illness take the studies into a far broader realm that of diseases probably caused by several different factors acting in concert Two studies of manicdepressive illness found genetic markers for the disease on two different chromosomes That adds support to the belief held by many scientists that the disease characterized by alternative periods of deep depression and frantic overactivity is really not a single entity but a family of related disorders Furthermore the findings cast strong doubt on the old idea that such illness could be explained entirely by the stresses of life and similar psychological assaults In a group of Old Order Amish living in Pennsylvania scientists found a genetic marker for the disease on chromosome 11 The other study of Jews living in Jerusalem found a correlation between the illness and a still unidentified defect on the X chromosome Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes all identified by number except the sex chromosomes two X chromosomes in the female and one X and one Y in the male The studies are not necessarily in conflict nor do they suggest that the two population groups are particularly prone to manicdepressive illness but they do support the view that the diseases are heterogeneous Dr David L Pauls of Yale University a member of the research team that studied the Amish group also noted that the chromosome ll location might offer new insights into the biochemistry of the illness The research team has not yet discovered the actual gene that is defective in the patients who seem to be particularly susceptible to this devastating illness Instead through a combination of family studies and the latest techniques of molecular biology they have found markers chance variations in the chemistry of the genes so close to the putative defective gene that they are almost always inherited together The genes of all living things are segments of DNA deoxyribonucleic acid A marker can be a deletion of a piece of the genetic material an insertion of an added piece or some other subtle variation These variations which need not be damaging to the individual can be detected by modern biological techniques Dr Paul said the location on chromosome 11 identified by his group also happens to be close to a known gene for an important substance tyrosine hydroxylase This is an enzyme that participates in the complex chemistry of the brain Indeed he said it is part of the pathway of biochemical events that seems to be deranged in manic depressive patients The studies did not begin with any concentration at all on that chemical or its gene but the discovery may further illuminate the chemistry of the disorder New Strategy in Research The discovery of clues to the gene on chromosome ll was made through a strategy that some scientists call reverse genetics As defined by Dr Stuart H Orkin of Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School reverse genetics is the search for a gene before its specific function or the chemistry of its product is known In the past the search for malfunctioning genes has usually proceeded from a knowledge of the chemistry involved in a given disease such as the lack of a vital enzyme The scientists have proceeded from that to discovery of the gene that is the blueprint for the bodys manufacture of that enzyme Dr Orkin whose research is done also at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Boston was a leader in the recent discovery of the gene defect characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease This discovery too was a triumph of reverse genetics The identification of the gene within the past year is considered one of the most important recent achievements in the field It was done in collaboration with scientists led by Dr Louis M Kunkel of Childrens Hospital and the DanaFarber Institute who discovered another important genetic defect the gene involved in Duchennes muscular dystrophy Although the two diseases are believed to be unrelated they are both in the Xchromosome Clues from the Duchennes studies helped solve the riddle of the gene that is the key to the other disease The gene involved in Duchennes muscular dystrophy is important because it offers hope of better understanding this tragic disease The gene is also notable for its huge size far greater than that of most other known genes So far only a portion of it has been found and analyzed That such discoveries are beginning to come more and more frequently is no coincidence They all derive from technical advances made within the past several years in molecular biology the explosively developing branch of science that studies life on its most fundamental level the individual cells and molecules of living things Most of the recent discoveries have involved diseases in which an abnormality of one or another single gene is the probable cause of the illness Duchennes muscular dystrophy Huntingtons disease sometimes called Huntingtons chorea and probably cystic fibrosis are all thought to be diseases of this kind Recent discoveries have shown that this link to a single gene is also true of retinoblastoma but with an unusual twist Every normal person has two copies of a gene that seems to protect against wild undisciplined cancerous growth of cells in the eye The normal function of the gene appears to be that of serving as a restraining influence on growth of cells in the bodys complex skein of chemical checks and balances Only when heredity or some accident in fetal development or both conspire to inactivate both of those genes does the eye cancer retinoblastoma develop Dr Cassandra Smith of Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons says two major advances made several years ago have contributed greatly to the proliferation of new genetic discoveries One was the concept that the search for human genes could be greatly accelerated by using enzymes of a family called restriction enzymes to cut pieces of DNA into welldefined fragments so that they could be sorted out and identified Alphabet of Heredity DNA the vital chemical of heredity is the active substance of the genes in all living things Its long twisted strands are strings of four fundamental subunits that serve as the alphabet of heredity In scientists shorthand the subunits are identified as G C A and T A group of three spells out the code for making one or another of the 20 different amino acids that are the building blocks of all proteins For example the sequence GAT is the code that tells a cell to add the amino acid leucine to a protein that is under construction Other combinations of three are the codes for making all of the other amino acids that go into the myriad proteins that are the main ingredients in living cells There are more than 100 known restriction enzymes They act as the scalpels of molecular biology Each different enzyme makes its cut whenever it encounters a particular sequence of subunits in the DNA strand Each of the enzymes has a different target sequence As a group they are powerful aids in cutting the genetic material in predictable ways and thus detecting normal variations Such variations are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLPs They are widely agreed to be one of the key ingredients in the current successes of the search for genes The concept of using RFLPs in the search for genes is usually credited to Dr David Botstein of Harvard Another key concept considered by many to be crucial to the search for genetic markers was a technique called pulsed gel electrophoresis a method that uses pulses of electricity to sort out huge pieces of DNA according to size This is an important step in identifying important segments of the genetic material Dr Charles Cantor of Columbia University devised the pulsed field concept about 1983 Important refinements were made later by Dr Maynard V Olson of Washington University St Louis and by Dr Ronald Davis of Stanford University In another promising line of research Dr Olson is developing a new technique that will make it possible to grow huge segments of DNA for study The DNA segments are grown in yeast cells The research has also been aided by recent advances in computer technology Dr Pauls said because this aids greatly in analysis of the voluminous and complex data In a recent review of reverse genetics research in the scientific journal Cell Dr Orkin said A new phase in the application of molecular genetics to the dissection of human inherited disease has begun
RULING IN BABY M CASE IS DUE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/31/nyregion/ruling-in-baby-m-case-is-due-today.html,When the decision in the Baby M custody case is announced today by a judge in Hackensack NJ legal scholars across the country will be watching for answers to fundamental questions raised by the dispute over a baby girl born one year ago Most lawyers agreed that nothing in current law prevented a woman from agreeing to bear a child for pay as the mother of Baby M Mary Beth Whitehead did in a surrogatemotherhood agreement with the father William Stern according to interviews with family law attorneys and a review of the growing volume of legal literature on the subject But several legal obstacles exist to the states forcing a woman to go through with an agreement and surrender the child if as with Mrs Whitehead she changes her mind Mr Stern and his wife Elizabeth have asked Judge Harvey R Sorkow of Superior Court to enforce the contract in which they agreed to pay Mrs Whitehead 10000 to bear a child conceived with Mr Sterns sperm Mrs Whitehead in fighting to keep the girl has argued the contract was against public policy and invalid Divisions Among Lawyers When Judge Sorkow reads his decision in the Bergen County Courthouse he will rule on two issues  the validity of the contract and the custody Most lawyers appear to agree that to win on the contract the Sterns must have persuaded Judge Sorkow that the 10000 fee did not constitute a price for the baby because selling babies is illegal and that Mrs Whitehead has no legal room to change her mind On the sale issue lawyers are divided On the changeofheart question many side with Mrs Whitehead arguing that under law a woman giving a baby up for adoption  in this case for adoption by Dr Stern a pediatrician has the right to change her mind Even if the Sterns lose on the two issues the judge could award custody of Baby M to the Sterns on the ground it would be in the childs best interests Argument on Fee Most lawyers agree that in the absence of any state laws to the contrary a womans legal right to enter a surrogate agreement is protected under privacy and righttoprocreation doctrine developed in the course of decisions limiting compulsory sterilization and assuring the right to contraception and abortion Where lawyers begin to differ is the fee To some the payment constitutes selling a baby which is illegal under all statutes in all states In 1981 in one of the earliest surrogatemotherhood cases a Michigan appeals court invalidated a surrogate agreement on that ground last year courts in New York and Kentucky took an opposite view Laws against selling babies are part of adoption codes intended to prevent baby brokers or the parents of an unmarried pregnant girl from pressuring a woman to give up an unplanned baby with offers of money Because in the Baby M case and others the agreement to exchange money had been reached before the baby was conceived defenders of the surrogacy procedure argue the danger contemplated in the law is not present Survey by Law Journal Lay people have this intuitive feeling that it looks like baby selling and baby selling is just wrong said Lori Andrews a research lawyer with the American Bar Foundation and author of a book on surrogate motherhood But legal scholars try to look at the issues that the law is trying to prevent The New Jersey Law Journal asked 10 legal scholars to judge the case Most agreed with the New York and Kentucky court decisions that the fee was not a price for the baby Only one held that the contract could require Mrs Whitehead to give up all maternal claim to her child Other prominent lawyers in child and family law would not give up on the babyselling issue however The fundamental issue  and you can talk to various and sundry legal scholars all day and you wont come to cloture on this issue  is whether or not it is baby selling said Angela R Holder a clinical professor of pediatrics and law and counsel for medicolegal affairs at the Yale Medical SchoolYale New Haven Hospital 13th Amendment Rights They make the point that the contract is signed before the baby is conceived instead of after she said But money still changes hands and the baby still changes families because of it Ms Holder said she based her opposition to surrogate motherhood on the 13th Amendment which outlaws slavery Once a baby is born she said it acquires the rights of a citizen including the right not to be sold Whether you call it a fee for services or whatever its still baby selling she said Because theres no doubt in anybodys mind that if you didnt pay the woman the money she wouldnt do it A judge might award custody to the father experts said But under adoption law here and in most other states the mother retains a right to change her mind While a party can agree to surrender parental rights such a surrender can be revoked and can only occur after the birth of the child W Marshall Prettyman assistant professor of law at Seton Hall University wrote in The New Jersey Law Journal
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; HUSTLER-FALWELL CASE WILL BE HEARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/31/us/supreme-court-roundup-hustler-falwell-case-will-be-heard.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to hear Hustler magazines appeal of a 200000 award to the Rev Jerry Falwell for his emotional distress over publication of a parody depicting the evangelist as an incestuous drunk The jury had found the parody was not libelous because it did not purport to be true and would not be believed Nevertheless the jury assessed the sexually explicit magazine and its publisher Larry Flynt 200000 on the novel legal theory that publications may be held liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress Mr Flynt also appealed the verdict Press groups have expressed concern that the jury award and a Federal appellate courts decision upholding it could set a dangerous precedent threatening cartoonists writers and comedians who engage in sharp criticism or mockery of public figures A threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the award by the Federal jury in Roanoke Va holding the defendants liable for an outrageous and intentional effort to harm Mr Falwell a nationally prominent television evangelist and advocate of conservative political causes A Dissent Despite Repugnance The full Fourth Circuit voted 65 not to rehear the case In dissenting Judge J Harvie Wilkinson said he shared the courts profound repugnance for Hustlers offensive personal attack on Mr Falwell But he warned that the decision could be a powerful inhibitor of humorous and satiric commentary and ultimately affect the health and vigor of all political debate The possibility that controversial public figures could run to court and recover for emotional distress when a jury has found no false statemnt of fact no libel and no reputational damage undermines the First Amendment and its core purpose of protecting political debate he said In their appeal Hustler and Mr Flynt argued that courts and juries should not be able to circumvent the First Amendment restrictions the Supreme Court has imposed on libel suits Those restrictions would be circumvented by allowing public figure plaintiffs to recover damages for hurt feelings from published material that is not false they argued The Supreme Court has ruled in libel suits that public officials and public figures may recover damages only for intentionally or recklessly false defamation and that the First Amendment protects vehement caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks Some Journalists Back Appeal Hustler and Mr Flynt argued that the same First Amendment rules should also limit emotional distress suits The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and two Virginia newspapers made similar arguments in briefs supporting the appeal But Mr Falwells attorney Norman Roy Grutman said in urging the Court not to hear the appeal that the case involved only the aberrant behavior of Larry Flynt There is nothing in the First Amendment that requires protection for the calculated premeditated and deliberate infliction of harm targeted at a specific individual Mr Grutman argued Mr Falwells suit was provoked by Hustlers publication in 1983 and 1984 of a parody of advertisements of Campari an aperitif in which celebrities described with sexual overtones their first time drinking Campari Disclaimer Was Not Soothing The parody included a photograph of Mr Falwell and a mock interview in which he was depicted describing a drunken incestuous encounter with his mother in an outhouse and remarking I always get sloshed before I go out to the pulpit In small print at the bottom were the words Ad parody  not to be taken seriously The Supreme Court appeal is Hustler v Falwell No 861278 Mr Flynts last known visit to the Supreme Court was for an oral argument in a case involving Hustler in 1983 He was arrested after he began screaming obscenities at the Court The Supreme Court also dealt with these matters today Sanctuary Appeal It refused without comment to hear an appeal by two members of the Sanctuary movement who said their convictions on charges of conspiring to transport five illegal aliens from Central America within the United States violated their rights to free exercise of religion The Courts action ended the last appeal of John B Elder and Stacy Lynn Merkt who had argued that their Christian beliefs required them to give sanctuary to refugees from El Salvador fleeing from the threat of torture and death Mr Elder who was also convicted of conspiring to smuggle illegal aliens into the country was director of a churchsupported refugee sanctuary in San Benito Tex and Ms Merkt worked as a volunteer there The appeal was Merkt v United States No 861089 Religious Garb The Court upheld without comment over three dissenting votes the suspension of an Oregon teacher for wearing Sikh religious garb a turban and allwhite clothing to her sixth and eighthgrade classes after she joined that religion in 1983 It made final a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court upholding the suspension under a state law that bars teachers from wearing any religious dress on the job The Oregon court ruled that the burden the law placed on the teachers free exercise of religion was necessitated by the need to insure the religious neutrality of the school and protect the religious freedom of impressionable children The Oregon court suggested however that teachers could not constitutionally be barred from wearing common decorations that a person might draw from a religious heritage such as a necklace with a small cross or Star of David Today the Supreme Court dismissed the teachers appeal for want of a substantial Federal question with Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day OConnor dissenting on the ground that the Court should have heard full arguments Such a ruling sets a nationally binding precedent although one the lower courts are free to interpret narrowly The case was Cooper v Eugene School District No 86701 Abortion Argument Canceled Without explanation the Court deferred until an unspecified later date an oral argument that had been set for this Wednesday in the only abortion case currently on its decision docket The unusual action probably means that the case will not be heard before October if ever The case Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 is an appeal by Illinois of a lower Federal court decision striking down a requirement that girls under 18 years old who seek abortions wait 24 hours after notifying their parents as an alternative to petitioning a judge to waive the notification requirement One lawyer involved in the case Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Unions Reproductive Freedom Project speculated that in studying the briefs the Justices may have though the case was not ready for review because there was no final judgment on all issues in the case in the lower court Air Bag Rules The Court refused to hear an appeal by New York State aimed at forcing the Reagan Administration to require installation of air bags as safety devices in all new cars Without comment it let stand in New York v Dole No 86999 a Federal appeals court decision upholding some rules on passive restraints that the Department of Transportation issued in 1984 and has since modified
SEVEN-WEEK TRIAL TOUCHED MANY BASIC EMOTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/nyregion/seven-week-trial-touched-many-basic-emotions.html,Beyond the walls of Judge Harvey R Sorkows courtroom here experts in philosophy law and psychiatry wrestle with social cultural and ethical questions about surrogate parents that go far beyond the Baby M custody case In the weeks before the trial involving Baby Ms mother Mary Beth Whitehead and father William Stern there were many calls for swift legislative action to prevent similar fights over children born of artificial insemination for a fee The intent appeared to be to regulate the practice But after the sevenweek trial of raw emotion and anguish the mood appears to be one calling for caution and careful study stricter guidelines and thoughtful reflection I havent heard any outpouring of people who think this might be a good thing a professor of legal issues in pediatrics at the Yale Medical School Angela R Holder said I think more people are against it than before Second Thoughts on Neutrality Only in the last month has the full impact of surrogacy been understood William Pierce president of the National Committee for Adoption and a foe of surrogacy said Many people who saw surrogacy as ethically neutral and socially neutral and legally neutral are having second thoughts Last year Mr Pierce said eight bills on surrogacy were introduced in eight state legislatures with one of them against surrogacy This year the committee has found 22 bills in 11 states and the District of Columbia nine of which seek to outlaw surrogacy The New York Legislature has four bills before it three in favor and one opposed according to Mr Pierce Quick action this session seems uncertain Three weeks ago Governor Cuomo expressed doubts about passage this term saying the issue was too profound and needed more study Recently Mr Cuomo instructed his twoyearold Task Force on Life and the Law to include the ethical and social implications of surrogacy on its agenda The panel is studying legal definitions of death organ transplants discontinuing life supports for the severely ill artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization WideRanging Examination The New Jersey Legislature is considering three bills two opposed to surrogacy and one on creating a study panel None seems headed for quick floor debate The General Assembly in Connecticut is considering a bill that would permit a surrogate mother to keep a child born of artificial insemination In the aftermath of the trial and Judge Sorkows ruling it appears that surrogacy is poised for the wideranging examination that the judge specifically barred in his exploration of whether the Sterns or the Whiteheads were the more suitable parents to meet the best interests of Baby M The primary focus of the trial was a harsh concentrated attack on Mrs Whiteheads personality and emotional state and the stability of her home and marriage Shaking the Certainty But surrogacy and its ramifications  including the very concept of motherhood  are more profound according to experts Does an acceptance of surrogacy mean that American society is ready for two types of mother  the biological mother who provides half the babys genes and surrenders the infant at birth for a fee and the psychological or caregiving mother the wife of the biological father This case shakes the certainty of defining the term mother  Dr Arthur Caplan a philosopher at the Hastings Center a research institute on biomedical ethics in Briarcliff Manor NY said Its socially and culturally disturbing It takes away a reference point This case chips away at our certainty of understanding our concept of mother Is it the environmental and social shaper or the person who provides the hereditary blueprint Dr Caplan sees other disturbing problems He asked how impoverished overpopulated thirdworld countries would view one segment of American societys ignoring thousands of children available for adoption and indulging in costly reproductive technology while another segment undergoes 15 million abortions a year Problems With Children He also raised questions about couples who could not afford the 30000 in surrogate costs for a child and whether surrogacy should remain private excluding the poor Or he added should health insurers underwrite its cost Mr Pierce brought up the possibility of an artificially inseminated child being born severely retarded or handicapped Will the biological father or the surrogate mother eventually dump these kids on society and have the states pay 18000 to 20000 a year for their institutional care he asked Another issue is whether surrogacy creates an exploited breeder class of women  the poor and educationally disadvantaged carrying and bearing children for the prosperous We dont want breeders for people in a different financial strata Dr Doris Jonas Freed cochairman of the surrogateparenting committee of the New York State Bar Association said The money has to be played down Focus on Commercialism State Senator John R Dunne Republican of Nassau County and cosponsor of a bill in favor of surrogacy said he sensed growing opposition to the fees associated with surrogacy Hearings on the measure are scheduled for April 10 in White Plains and May 7 in Albany I think the greatest attention will focus on commercial aspects Mr Dunne said We will have to weigh whether to outlaw the payment of fees Dr Freed said legalizing surrogacy was inevitable But she added laws must mandate careful counseling for all sides and very very rigid psychological genetic and physical screening We want to end the pain wherever its possible for everyone she said Another question is who is entitled to use a surrogate Some advocates insist new laws must restrict it solely to married heterosexual couples who are medically certified as infertile Effects on Other Children But if as some lawyers argue the Constitution insures the right to reproduce how can homosexual men and women be legally barred from using a surrogate or other forms of reproductive technology to obtain a child And how asked Myra T Peterson chairwomanelect of the family law section of the New Jersey Bar Association can courts prevent careeroriented women from hiring a surrogate out of simple convenience Another thing the trials brought out is the effect of surrogacy on the babys half siblings Ms Peterson said What does it do to those children when they see a child being given away or sold During the Baby M trial Judge Sorkow routinely ruled out testimony on emotional ties Mrs Whiteheads two children had for the baby He said the feelings had no bearing on the babys best interests Most important experts said no one knows what psychological scars will be inflicted on Baby M  or other children of surrogacy  when they learn their origins and in Baby Ms case of the bitter fight throughout her first year of life The whole case is just a tragedy for the child Professor Holder said because of both the publicity and the litigation If they go to the Supreme Court of the United States this child will be in first grade before she knows her ultimate destination For the rest of her life shell be the famous Baby M a clinical professor of child psychiatry at Columbia University Richard A Gardner said If the court had acted decisively and with finality in the first month of this there wouldnt be the psychological traumas there will be now
A NEW SHOWCASE FOR ART BY WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/arts/a-new-showcase-for-art-by-women.html,Born with a silver spoon in its mouth and bred to be noncontroversial the National Museum of Women in the Arts will open to the public April 7 after a ceremonial ribboncutting by Barbara Bush the wife of the Vice President The first museum devoted solely to female artists in a historical context it occupies a handsomely renovated landmark building  formerly a Masonic Temple  at New York Avenue and 13th Street two blocks from the White House Our potential is very exciting said Wilhelmina Billie Holladay the museums 64yearold founder Theres a subconscious view on the part of the masses that all good works were done by men But the museum will show to a wide public the many women artists who made great contributions beyond the wellknown names of Georgia OKeeffe and Mary Cassatt Besides its permanent collection  more than 500 examples of art by women from the Renaissance to the 20th century  donated by Mrs Holladay the museum will have a library and research center housing what it calls the most extensive collection of information on women artists A Note of Dissent But the museum cannot help being controversial It has already drawn fire from some feminist artists and scholars who worry about whether its existence will serve to segregate womens work rather than promote it and whether it will foster mediocre art They also deplore Mrs Holladays views that there is no place in the museum for abrasive issues such as politics homosexuality or abortion Already to greet the museums conservative opening show American Women Artists 18301930 organized by Eleanor Tufts an art historian a counterprogram has been mounted by the Washington Project for the Arts The show features works by women heavily involved in feminist issues We wanted to provide access to more provocative works by highly professional artists who deal with whats happening in the world today and who should be in the museums collection said the curator of visual arts programs at the Washington Project Mel Watkins An artist who has contributed work to one of the programs exhibitions Ida Applebroog added Were being intentionally provocative showing just the kind of work Mrs Holladay doesnt want in her museum Its a confrontation in terms of social political and sexual issues On the other hand Judy Chicago a feminist artist whose vast and controversial work The Dinner Party deals with the impact of women on Western culture said she supported the museum and would make a longterm loan of her painting Through the Flower Its important to protect and preserve womens art she said My preference is for that art to be preserved by existing institutions but they dont have a very good track record Mrs Holladays museum doesnt have to conform to my standards The real issue is taking care of the work Other museum officials meanwhile are giving mixed reviews to the new institution At the Metropolitan in New York the deputy curator for 20thcentury art Lowery Sims said One wants to believe that there is already enough integration of women and minorities into the art establishment But she added On the other hand there remains a lot to be done As a specialized institution like the Studio Museum and the Museo del Barrio here the womens museum could find talent that might be overlooked So I think its an exciting and interesting venture In Washington the associate director and chief curator of the Corcoran Gallery Jane Livingston said I think it could succeed insofar as its mission and its value is as a resource center a place to find lost history If it develops the seriousness and credibility of a university community all the rest will fall into place At the National Gallery of Art the deputy director John Wilmerding pointed out that the gallery itself was mounting two shows by women Berthe Morisot and Georgia OKeeffe  in the fall and said I think we cant help but support a new museum devoted to a specialized area of human creativity Yet in the long run there are lots of arguments whether a museum should be devoted to race or sex We like to consider art in terms of its merits rather than its makers A Promising Start The wife of Wallace Holladay a wealthy Washington architectengineer and businessman Mrs Holladay is wellknown among Republican and corporate leaders a circumstance that has helped her raise more than 17 million of her goal of 30 million for building for operating and for endowing the museum  Among corporate donors for example Martin Marietta the aerospace and military contracting corporation has given 15 million to refurbish the museums great hall Seeking any income we can get Mrs Holladay has also agreed to let Ridgewells a Washington caterer use the great hall  where no art hangs she pointed out  for what she considers appropriate events How Collection Began The Holladays began to collect art  works by Braque and Milton Avery  as a fun thing Mrs Holladay said Then traveling in Europe 20 years ago they bought a still life by the 17thcentury Flemish artist Clara Peeters Butthere was no information about her or other female artists in most standard textbooks of art history Their interest piqued they decided to confine their acquisitions to works by women and also began to build an important library of material about them Today the collection  admittedly uneven  ranges from the very regal Portrait of a Noblewoman by a 17thcentury Italian painter Lavinia Fontana to a poignant painting by Alice Neel a study of a tuberculosis patient in a Harlem hospital There are a number of works by 20thcentury and contemporary artists among them Sonia Delaunay Georgia OKeeffe Lee Krasner Alma Thomas Agnes Martin Helen Frankenthaler Dorothea Rockburne May Stevens and Dotty Attie all painters Berenice Abbott and Louise DahlWolfe both photographers and Dorothy Dehner Eva Hesse Alice Aycock and Nancy Graves sculptors Encouraged to make the collection public Mrs Holladay decided on the idea of a womens museum in 1981 Today although she has been accused of running a onewoman show while pressing into service a plethora of volunteers she points to a staff of 20 professionals at the museum headed by AnneImelda Radice adminstrative director who was formerly curator for the Architect of the Capitol But critics complain that there is no curator for 19th and 20thcentury art and that the acquisitions committee of four has no such expertise The committee includes Mrs Holladay Dr Radice Clarisse Smith a Washington artist and Ann Sutherland Harris who with Linda Nochlin put together the landmark historical show Women Artists 15501950 in 1977 Dr Harris who says she is consulted only sporadically on acquisitions notes that the question of a curator is a crucial one Im afraid the museum will have a credibility problem unless it hires someone with real training in 19th and 20thcentury art she said Its a little like running a Holocaust museum and refusing to hire Jews Adds Miriam Schapiro a wellknown artist who in the early 1970s set up with Ms Chicago a feminist art program at the California Institute of the Arts Frankly Im ambivalent I support such a museum because we need one to repair the historical omission of womens place in cultural history But in this there doesnt seem to be a concise acquisition position and exhibition program Also it needs a staff of the highest quality and an active rotating board of professional advisers It seems to me the code word here is Junior League But Mrs Holladay says that she is totally committed to the highest standards and that the museum hopes to follow guidelines laid down by the American Association of Museums Its a changing and growing thing she says We are working hard to put it all together Im a little angry that people have to come down on a side while the jurys still out
TO SERVE 'THE BEST INTERESTS OF A CHILD',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/nyregion/to-serve-the-best-interests-of-a-child.html,Following are excerpts from the decision by Judge Harvey R Sorkow in the surrogatemother dispute between Mary Beth Whitehead the mother of Baby M and William Stern the father The Issue The primary issue to be determined by this litigation is what are the best interests of a child until now called Baby M All other concerns raised by counsel constitute commentary    Jurisdiction There can be no solution satisfactory to all in this kind of case Justice our desired objective to the child and the mother to the child and the father cannot be obtained for both parents The court will seek to achieve justice for the child This courts fact finding and application of relevant law must mitigate against the heartfelt desires of one or the other of the natural parents Where courts are forced to choose between a parents rights and a childs welfare the choice is and must be the childs welfare and best interest by virtue of the courts responsibility as parens patriae Findings      It took years of legislative debate and judicial inquiry to define and develop todays laws of abortion and artificial insemination The issues and dimensions of surrogacy are still evolving but it is necessary that laws be adopted to give our society a sense of definition and direction if the concept is to be allowed to further develop With an increasing number of surrogate births legislation can avoid harm to society the family and the child    Many questions must be answered answers must come from legislation If there is no law then society will suffer the negative aspects of this alternative reproduction vehicle that appears to hold out so much hope to the childless who make up a substantial segment of our society      The four experts called by the parties both hypothetical and clinical all conclude that Mrs Stern has multiple sclerosis  albeit in a mild form and the possibility of progression is limited to unknown      With regard to Mrs Sterns disease all the experts called on this issue conclude that her decision not to become pregnant in light of her knowledge of her disease her experienced symptomology the accepted medical understanding of the medical profession at the time that risk of exacerbation was attendant to pregnancy was a medically reasonable and understandable decision    It is argued that the child will not be protected So long as there is no legislation and some court action in surrogacy arrangements is required the child born of surrogacy will be protected in New Jersey If there is compliance with the contract terms adoption will be necessary hence court inquiry about best interests must take place If there is noncompliance with the contract as in this case best interest is still litigated with protection to the child    The second argument against surrogacy is that the surrogate mother will be exploited To the contrary It is the private adoption that has that great potential if not fact for the exploitation of the mother In the private adoption the woman is already pregnant The biological father may be unknown or at best uninterested in his obligation The woman may want to keep the child but cannot do so for financial reasons There is the risk of illegal consideration being paid to the mother In surrogacy none of these downside elements appear The arrangement is made when the desire and intention to have a family exist on the couples part The surrogate has an opportunity to consult take advice and consider her act and is not forced into the relationship She is not yet pregnant The third argument is that to produce or deal with a child for money denigrates human dignity To that premise this court urgently agrees The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution is still valid law The law of adoption in New Jersey does prohibit the exchange of any consideration for obtaining a child The fact is however that the money to be paid to the surrogate is not being paid for the surrender of the child to the father    The biological father pays the surrogate for her willingness to be impregnated and carry his child to term At birth the father does not purchase the child It is his own biological genetically related child He cannot purchase what is already his The fourth argument against surrogacy is that it is a concept running contrary to the laws of adoption in New Jersey It is in this courts view that the laws of adoption in this state do not apply to surrogacy contracts      The fifth argument against surrogacy is that it will undermine traditional notions of family How can that be when the childless husband and wife so very much want a child    The final and sixth argument suggests an elite upper economic group of people will use the lower economic group of woman to make their babies This argument in insensitive and offensive to the intense drive to procreate naturally and when that is impossible to use what lawful means as possible to gain a child      It must be reasoned that if one has a right to procreate coitally then one has the right to reproduce noncoitally If it is the reproduction that is protected then the means of reproduction are also to be protected The value and interests underlying the creation of family are the same by whatever means obtained This court holds that the protected means extends to the use of surrogates    While a state could regulate indeed should and must regulate the circumstances under which parties enter into reproductive contracts it could not ban or refuse to enforce such transactions altogether without compelling reason It might even be argued that refusal to enforce these contracts and prohibition of money payments would constitute an unconstitutional interference with procreative liberty since it would prevent childless couples from obtaining the means with which to have families    For the foregoing reasons this court concludes and holds that the surrogate parenting agreement is a valid and enforceable contract pursuant to the laws of New Jersey The rights of the parties to contract are constitutionally protected under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution This court is satisfied by clear and convincing proof that Mr and Mrs Stern wanted and planned for this child They intended to be parents of the child They have a strong and mutually supportive relationship wherein each respects the other and there is a balancing of obligations There is proof of a successful cooperative parenting effort The Sterns have a private quiet and unremarkable life which augurs well for a stable household environment Mr and Mrs Stern show sensitivity to the childs physical and emotional needs They would be supportive of education and have shown at least in their own lives a motivation for learning      Finally they have shown no difficulty in coping with crisis It may be anticipated that because the child is unique and at risk crisis for the next several years will be part of their lives Mr and Mrs Stern have shown an ability to deal with such

ART: WORKS BY GOURFAIN AT BROOKLYN MUSEUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/03/arts/art-works-by-gourfain-at-brooklyn-museum.html,THERE is much that is admirable about Peter Gourfains exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum It is called Roundabout and Other Works and it consists of 56 paintings works on paper ceramic pots and reliefs The ambition is epic Mr Gourfain wants to include everything inspire justice and transformation and compose a narrative on nothing less than the human condition The centerpiece of the show through May 11 is Roundabout a large wooden sculpture on which Mr Gourfain worked from 1976 to 1984 when the wood dust made him ill and forced him to stop carving It consists of 10 arched upright ribs arranged in a circle like 10 ribbons around a maypole The ribs converge around and support a ring or oculus that is nine feet off the ground Many ribs are lined with reliefs revealing the artists sympathy for James Joyce and Vincent van Gogh and moving in as many directions as scenes on Romanesque and Gothic capitals The sculpture suggests a new kind of astrological tool or the ribs of a new ark Mr Gourfain is 52 years old He was born in Chicago he is of Celtic Scottish and Russian ancestry he has taught all over the United States and in Canada and he has lived in Brooklyn since 1974 He is recreation director for the Division of Senior Centers of the City of New York and has chosen to remain largely outside the commercial art system In the catalogue Charlotta Kotik the curator of the exhibition refers to his classical and baroque periods In the 1960s he was a Minimalist using wood beams to build allusive and ephemeral constructions This show is primarily concerned with the artist since he became a maximalist Mr Gourfains strengths lie in his craftsmanship his energy and his decorative skill In his eight terracotta panels from his Doors on Ecology the sense of rhythm and lushness of shape and texture give the images sculptural weight Each of Mr Gourfains large ceramic urns is a kind of stage rolling with signs studded with expressive faces and gestures each with a role in a different morality play Mr Gourfain has clearly been inspired by the Middle Ages when architecture sculpture and painting worked together toward an encyclopedic goal But the work has serious weaknesses Despite the artists attempts to create a dynamic tension between the obvious and the esoteric the statements about injustice remain obvious and banal There is too much going on in these works and not enough of an imperative to formulate thoughts and feelings we do not already know The problem is almost endemic to art with this kind of ambition It would be instructive to organize a show on the many artists who have reacted against the fragmentation of the age by trying to make art that is an allinclusive whole The key weakness lies in the relationship between the reductive and the excessive sides of the work In his use of similar and sometimes identical shapes in his urns ribs and reliefs Mr Gourfain has maintained the modular serial approach of Minimalism But what he has done in effect is to take this Minimalist base and graft onto it a visionary veneer With a Richard Serra or a Donald Judd systematic thinking can unleash something powerfully unsystematic and irrational With Mr Gourfain the systematic and the irrational remain separate This is why the work despite all that it has going for it is limited Also of interest this week Tom Otterness Brooke Alexander Gallery 59 Wooster Street Tom Otternesss global approach has been leading him toward an epic statement and in The Tables he has tried to make one The sculpture consists of three rectangular steel tables together 38 feet long that form the stage for an elaborate allegory They are like work or dining tables As we sit on the steel benches around them there is a sense of being as much the director or prime mover as the artist The sculpture is meant to appeal to children and adults It is playful and apocalyptic It has many problems but it cannot be dismissed Everything on the tables is in bronze At one end of the work is a huge tarantulalike creature with a hammer and sickle wedged into its body At the other end a bulbous form shaped like a bomb seems either in the process of being dropped or in the process of being raised into position for blasting the spider Above the middle table is a cracked globe on top of which sits the reaper of death looking at his watch The tables are cluttered with signs of amusement food communication and war Running amok over everything is an army of tiny figures immersed in a variety of creative and destructive activities There is a lot of fun in Mr Otternesss world but there are no heroes  not the superpowers not the people As inventive as the work is  and it has inspired moments  it is also labored Part of the problem is that it has been created at a time when there is both a need for coherent tightly controlled narratives and a belief that such narratives are somehow undemocratic the artist seemed unable to decide whether to take us firmly by the hand or give us full interpretative mobility Because the work seems to lack a unifying purpose or tone the small figures can seem cloying and the sculpture too busy But this is the work of someone who thinks big and it is not an end but a beginning Through April 11 Paul Marcus PPOW Gallery 337 East Eighth Street Paul Marcus is an artist of impressive talent who uses an Expressionist language to call attention to events and situations that he wants visitors to respond to with immediacy Half of his show is given to A Life a series of woodcuts inspired by his volunteer work in Covenant House a center for runaway children The heroine is a 14yearold girl forced to leave a violent and troubled home and make her way in an exploitative world The woodcuts make their point but they are unable to plunge us inside the girls world and make us stay there The other half of the show consists of paintings They are done on wood which Mr Marcus may carve and use as printing blocks before painting on them The subjects are topical In Remember When we are shown how grim an illegal abortion can be In The Auction we are presented with a farm scene that brings to mind Grant Wood but it documents a moment of crisis in farming and there is no romance in it The artists links with German Expressionism and perhaps with Hans Haacke are not surprising But there is also a touch of William Hogarth in the four New York cityscapes that are the quietest and most deeply felt works in the show Through Sunday Phillip Pavia Edward Thorp Gallery 103 Prince Street Phillip Pavia is an Abstract Expressionist sculptor who has been working with stone throughout his career He uses marble from all over the world China Spain Africa Italy Greece and Belgium  and with his exceptional feeling for texture and light makes them compatible and builds his private United Nations He works the stone but never in a way that fundamentally alters its identity He tends to lay stones side by side in clusters or huddled masses that arouse conflicting architectural and figurative associations The 1977 Moon Watcher seems to have the solidity of post and lintel architecture and the precariousness of a house of cards The upright blocks suggest both the claustrophobic stone crowds of Louise Bourgeois and the alienated walking figures in Giacomettis City Square Moon Watcher is installed on the kind of circular revolving wood platform used in traditional studios It is the only kind of base on which the sculptures in this show are comfortable Through tomorrow Bruce Gagnier Leslie Cecil Gallery 16 East 72d Street In his new paintings Bruce Gagnier has entered the translucent webs of his previous works found in them strands of narrative drama and pulled the webs apart so the stories could be revealed They are about water and fire drowning and resuscitation isolation and togetherness They are filled with naked human beings huddled together with little power to resolve their crisis the only creatures that make a difference are dogs Mr Gagniers textures are still watery his color is now closer to watercolor His sources are in Renaissance Italy 19thcentury France and Abstract Expressionism One key tension in these paintings is between the heaviness of the content and the thinness of the paint Another is between the figures who remain still and hesitant and the sometimes wild movement of the hills and skies While the sky seems to have exploded in In the Swamp two dogs chasing a stag seem to be in the process of becoming frozen like Daphne in Berninis Apollo and Daphne One recurrent problem involves maintaining the impression of spontaneity while struggling to give every part of the painting comparable purpose The direction Mr Gagnier is following feels right He is not trying to make a big statement but he may end up making one Through April 18 Sandra Mackintosh  Unstrung Sculpture Cordier and Ekstrom Gallery 417 East 75th Street One sculpture in Sandra Mackintoshs new show faces the gallery like a conductor raising his baton All around it we see the orchestra  17 other wood sculptures shaped like stringed instruments similar to but distinct from all the harps mandolins lyres sitars and violins we have seen Almost every instrument is upright fixed to a metal rod that determines how far the sculpture should be off the ground Like Ms Mackintoshs previous sculptures these hieratic constructions finely crafted from furniture and other wood objects are reminiscent of tribal art But they also suggest works by Picasso and Klee as well as The Hand by Giacometti another artist whose work has its share of musical associations Ms Mackintosh has played on her lighter side here and it is an impressive performance Through April 18

TV DEALS WITH SEX MORE CANDIDLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/arts/tv-deals-with-sex-more-candidly.html,Sex long a prime target for televisions censors has been gaining primetime exposure this season Television producers and network officials acknowledge that sexual topics are being discussed more freely and openly than they ever have been before in television history and they say the trend will probably continue While less sexual promiscuity may be portrayed on television next season given the concerns about AIDS there will be greater explicitness when sexual subjects are addressed The producers and officials say several things are behind the increased frankness about sexual topics not least of which is economic cutbacks at the networks especially in broadcaststandards departments  the official name for the censors The reality is that the networks have had to cut back a lot of their staff positions said Robert Greenwald the director of The Burning Bed which was about a battered wife and the executive producer of Daddy an ABC movie that is to be broadcast at 9 PM Sunday and is one of the programs that reflect the new sexual standards And so theyre giving a freer creative hand to producers whom they trust Examples of the Change In Daddy a teenage boy hands another boy a condom In one scene in a recent NBCTV movie Unnatural Causes the main character played by Alfre Woodard removed her artificial breast and referred to it with a mildly vulgar term Some of the most popular series  The Golden Girls St Elsewhere Moonlighting and the new LA Law  featured dialogue this season that was loaded with doubleentendres We have fewer restrictions confirmed Ted Harbert vice president in charge of movies for television at ABC Alan Wurtzel ABCs vice president in charge of broadcast standards and practices elaborated In the 1960s it was the movies that dealt with controversial social issues Now television films and series are the primary vehicles for exploring those issues and when the issues are dealt with responsibly people seem willing to give television greater latitude Another reason that is cited for more explicit sexuality on television is the competition from cable television and video cassettes which have traditionally been more explicit than the networks and have chipped away at network audiences Terry Grossman coproducer of The Golden Girls said recently I do think that the competition from cable and VCRs has prompted more liberal attitudes at the networks toward adult themes and dialogue Viewers have more choices than ever before Showing the Consequences Some critics have expressed concerns about televisions new frankness Sex is a natural part of life and were not against sexual content presented in the media said Marcy Kelly the publicity director for the Center for Population Options But we would like television to show the consequences of sexual activity Gordon Berry a professor of educational psychology and communications studies at the University of California at Los Angeles voiced a similar concern Television routinely shows the consequences of crime he said It would also be healthy to show the consequences of sexual behavior particularly in stories about teenagers who are sexually active We have to help young people be wise consumers and television is a great teacher By the consequences of sexual activity they mean more frankness about birth control and sexually transmitted diseases acquired immune deficiency syndrome in particular I would hope that in the current climate there will be fewer onenight stands and less bedhopping shown on television Ms Kelly said New Policy at CBS At CBS which has lost about half the employees in its broadcaststandards department longstanding practices have been changed According to George Dessart the networks vice president of program practices CBS started a policy last summer of giving programming executives the responsibility for keeping the show in line with network standards after the 10th episode of a series Many movies made for television are also supervised by the programming division rather than the networks censors We had a training program for our executives last summer Mr Dessart said and we have written guidelines for them They still consult with us if there is a particularly complex or sensitive episode But we no longer look over their shoulder on a daily basis Our department still monitors childrens programs game shows theatrical films shown on television and all dramas based on fact At NBC and ABC the broadcaststandards departments continue to monitor every show but with a smaller staff Mr Wurtzel said there had been a significant reduction in his department at ABC Broadcaststandards executives at the three networks said changes in standards had not been radical Ralph Daniels vice president of broadcast standards at NBC described the changes as glacial and added Were still lightyears away from what can be shown in theatrical films Few Objections Reported Nevertheless the executives said changes had taken place Mr Dessart described Designing Women a racy show about the sexual adventures of four women working together as certainly different from anything we have done before But he said there had been almost no viewer protests about the sexual content of the series Similarly Mr Daniels said that viewers had accepted the sophisticated dialogue on such shows as St Elsewhere and LA Law A project that clearly illustrates the new network standards is Daddy a story about unintended teenage pregnancy told from the young fathers point of view According to John Herzfeld the writerdirector of the film the project is a response to statistics about the rise in the number of teenage pregnancies ABC wanted to do a story that would stretch the boundaries of television Mr Herzfeld said I wanted to have the kids talk with as much candor as possible They talk about abortion about condoms and diaphrams about orgasm and ejaculation We had endless discussions with the broadcaststandards department about the film but so far I have not lost any battles Some of the information may make some viewers uncomfortable Mr Harbert said But the question we asked ourselves was whether the magnitude of the problem warranted going a little further than other shows For us the answer was yes

PROSTITUTES' ROLE IN AIDS SURVEYED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/nyregion/prostitutes-role-in-aids-surveyed.html,LEAD EARLY data from a federally sponsored study of prostitutes in northern New Jersey show that 57 percent may be infected with AIDS a rate seven times higher than the average for other metropolitan areas where similar studies were made EARLY data from a federally sponsored study of prostitutes in northern New Jersey show that 57 percent may be infected with AIDS a rate seven times higher than the average for other metropolitan areas where similar studies were made State health officials said that the findings although disturbing were not clearcut evidence that New Jersey prostitutes were getting or spreading AIDS through their sexual practices Nearly all the subjects they said were recruited through drugtreatment programs and had histories of intravenous drug use a prime transmission route of acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS Dr John H Rutledge a deputy State Commissioner of Health said that the prostitutes in the New Jersey survey probably posed less of a risk to their customers than they did to intravenous drug users with whom they might share needles Nevertheless Dr Rutledge said men who visit prostitutes should be aware of the high rate of AIDS infection in that population Someone should think twice before visiting a prostitute he warned and if he does he should insist on safe sexual methods Released last month the results were part of a sevencity study sponsored by the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta Researchers surveyed prostitutes in Paterson Jersey City and Newark treating the three cities as one metropolitan area The research was designed to assess the rate of AIDS infection among prostitutes as well as the risks they pose to others AIDS experts have viewed prositutes as a way that AIDS can be spread from intravenous drug users to the nondrugusing heterosexual population In New Jersey 32 of the 56 prostitutes tested had AIDS antibodies in their blood a sign of possible infection Miami ranked second with a 187 percent rate In Las Vegas where prostitutes are licensed and tested monthly for AIDS exposure all the subjects tested negative Of the 779 prostitutes tested outside New Jersey the average positive rate was 85 percent None of the New Jersey prostitutes had fullblown AIDS However John French chief of the Office of Data Analysis and Epidemiology in the states Division of Alcohol Narcotics and Drug Abuse said that some of the women had swollen lymph nodes and had recently lost weight symptoms that can be early signs of AIDS All but three of those tested in the state had used drugs intravenously according to John Massey the publichealth official who supervised the study A 1984 study of intravenous drug users conducted in northern New Jersey found that 25 percent to 55 percent had positive AIDS blood tests In the latest survey New Jersey prostitutes reported that oral sex was the most common sexual act they performed with customers That finding is somewhat reassuring Dr Rutledge said because of all sexual behaviors oral sex probably has the least chance of spreading AIDS There never has been a case reported where oral sex was the only sexual behavior Dr Rutledge added that threefourths of the New Jersey prostitutes in the study reported using condoms even during oral sex New Jersey prostitutes who agreed to take part in the study were paid 20 to answer questions about their drug sex and medical histories and to submit to blood tests and a superficial physical examination Claire Sterk the sociologist who conducted the study said that interviews lasted 30 minutes to three hours depending on whether the women wanted to talk She said that the subjects ranged in age from 18 to 49 and that the length of their prostitution experience had varied from a few months to 19 years Most had had at least one abortion and one child Mrs Sterk who has done similar research in Amsterdam the Netherlands asked each subject frank questions about the type and frequency of her sexual practices as well as about the behavior of her customers She found that many of the prostitutes were worried about AIDS and as a result had been using condoms more often The women buy them or their pimps supply them she said adding that many of the prostitutes had learned to apply condoms without their customers knowing and that the women teach each other the technique Mr French said that the New Jersey study called for a total of 360 prostitutes to be tested by Oct 1 He said that new recruitment methods which would not rely on contacts made at drugtreatment centers would make the final results more representative Mrs Sterk said that she has been hanging out on street corners trying to meet prospective subjects Once the women discover that I am not trying to take their customers away and that they can trust me they are pretty receptive she said A lot of the women  and some pimps  are really very concerned about AIDS but do not like health institutions They like this setup because they can get tested for AIDS without leaving their world Mr Massey said that there was no provision in the study for tracing women with positive blood tests We cannot follow up because of confidentiality rules he said We record them by numbers not names The women do not even have to sign their names on the informedconsent slip Mr Massey added that subjects had been told to contact staterun AIDS counseling centers to obtain the test results He did not know how many had Dr Rutledge said he did not believe that new prostitution laws were required We do not see a need to round up prostitutes he said The best approach to reducing risks among prostitutes is increased education Since prostitution is illegal in New Jersey anyway we would have great difficulty enforcing any new laws State health offiials are considering extending an education project now under way in Atlantic City that uses current or former prostitutes to distribute condoms and AIDS information to other prostitutes Lee Budd the citys Director of Public Health said that it had one of the states seven AIDS counseling and testing centers and that the prostitute project was part of the centers outreach program We want to protect both prostitutes and their johns Mr Budd said noting that there were as many as 1500 prostitutes who frequented Atlantic City and that last year there had been more than 900 arrests for prostitution He said that until three weeks ago when she disappeared an active prostitute had handed out about 150 AIDS pamphlets bearing this headline For Women Only  Work Play Love Safely The pamphlet contains a single condom and states Because of the work you do your own health may be in danger The handout urges prostitutes to have clients wear condoms or refuse their business and not to allow semen to enter their bodies The pamphlet also warns prostitutes not to share dirty intravenous needles and tells them to get off drugs and get into a treatment program
"ADOPTION MARKET: BIG DEMAND, TIGHT SUPPLY",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/us/adoption-market-big-demand-tight-supply.html,The legal battle over Baby M that was decided this week in a New Jersey courtroom has focused attention on a widening gap between the number of infertile American couples who want children and the number of babies available for adoption Out of desperation for a baby couples are increasingly placing advertisements in college and urban newspapers seeking an unwed mother willing to surrender her child Some couples have even sought infants by placing notices on cars at shopping center parking lots and on park benches and railroad overpasses Federal officials say the rising demand has also led to a proliferation of organized rings that smuggle babies some of them kidnapped across the Mexican border and then sell them to the highest bidder in this country Competing for Babies Its a bad business said Clifton J Rogers deputy district director of the Immigraion and Naturalization Service in San Diego Its one thing to smuggle an adult who will go to work in this country Its another to prey on the deep suffering and need that people have for a baby Although physicians say growing numbers of childless couples like William and Elizabeth Stern the New Jersey couple awarded custody of Baby M are contracting with surrogate mothers or trying to conceive a child through laboratory fertilization methods most first try to adopt a child in a marketplace in which there is far more demand than supply And those who compete in this marketplace say the experience can be frustrating painful and emotional The frustrating thing is there arent the number of babies out there that there used to be said Helen Barbato of Pleasanton Calif who with her husband Gary is among thousands of Americans who send letters make phone calls and use whatever other strategies they can to find an infant or a pregnant woman willing to give up her unborn child We came close this weekend right in our own neighborhood when we heard about a girl who was pregnant Mrs Barbato said But people are telling her You can get money for your baby Its illegal but you have to compete with people who are willing to buy a baby According to the National Committee for Adoption an association of 130 private adoption agencies adoptions between unrelated people in the United States declined to 50720 from 82800 from 1971 through 1982 the last year for which complete data are available The 38 percent decline is attributed principally to a diminishing pool of children available because of more abortions a greater use of contraceptives and a lessening of the social stigma faced by single parents Some experts however estimate that the number of adoptions has risen about 10 percent since 1982 primarily because of successful efforts by Roman Catholic groups to persuade some unmarried pregnant women not to have abortions and more important a sharp increase in children brought to this country legally generally by public and private agencies for adoption by American families The number of foreignborn children adopted in the United States rose from 4868 in the 1981 fiscal year to 9945 last year Of those 6188 almost twothirds came from South Korea Baby Boom Generation Despite the apparent recent increase in the availability of infants for adoption social workers and family counselors say the demand is growing faster than the supply They say the main reason is that many members of the postwar baby boom generation after postponing parenthood have discovered they are infertile We have 12 to 15 prospective parents for every easytoplace baby said Raymond Chirosky an official in California of the Childrens Home Society a national private adoption agency referring to what he and others describe as the most soughtafter child a white infant with no physical or mental handicaps According to adoption specialists the widening gap between supply and demand has spurred not only the smuggling of growing numbers of babies from Mexico and other Latin countries but also the creation of a new kind of entrepeneur who helps couples find a baby usually for a large fee Officials say many are swindlers who exploit the desperation of childless couples with promises of infants that are never fulfilled Payments of 10000 or More In Petaluma a city about 45 miles north of here for example police officials last month charged Annette M Tonkin and Lewis E Reid with taking 3500 from a couple after telling them Miss Tonkin was pregnant and the child could be theirs if they paid Miss Tonkins maternity and delivery expenses Investigators have alleged that Miss Tonkin and Mr Reid bilked other couples the same way at least twice before In another case the authorities in Athens Ala said Tuesday that they were investigating the 1980 slayings of two young mothers who they say were killed by an itinerant couple from Washington State That couple the authorities said then sold the womens children to couples who wanted to be parents Social workers say the willingness of many childless couples to pay 10000 or more for a child is also attracting lawyers to a field once monopolized by public adoption agencies and private groups such as the Childrens Home Society Independent adoptions handled by lawyers now account for more than onethird of the adoptions nationally and a substantially larger proportion in some states particularly California Serving as Adoption Brokers In a few cities such nonprofit groups as Friends in Adoption in Pawlet Vt and the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill Calif offer counseling services usually for a small fee that are intended to teach couples how to find infants without having to use a lawyer But social workers say the great majority of independent adoptions are handled by lawyers Although they emphasized that many lawyers specializing in adoption act ethically and responsibly the social workers contended that some in effect serve as little more than brokers at an infant auction often encouraging wouldbe parents to offer a gift to the pregnant woman in exchange for her child William L Pierce president of the National Committee for Adoption said that in some cases lawyers and other entrepreneurs placed classified advertisements purporting to be from eager couples seeking a woman willing to give up her child But he said the majority of such advertisements appear to be legitimate While conceding that physicians lawyers and other third parties have acted as intermediaries between unwed mothers and childless couples for decades Mr Pierce said Its much bigger now because the profits are greater and the desperation has gotten greater Making a Business of It This week the personal columns of The Salt Lake City Tribune contained seven advertisements soliciting pregnant women for their children In telephone interviews several wouldbe parents who placed the advertisements said they had received what appeared to be promising legitimate calls from women willing to give up their babies but they said they were troubled by some of the calls A 39yearold woman from Long Island said she had received a call from one young woman demanding 30000 for her unborn child I told her I didnt want to buy a baby I wanted to adopt one After receiving several similar calls a Los Angeles woman said I think there are some girls who get pregnant just to make a business of it Sending Out Resumes Despite criticism of the growing phenomenon of independent adoptions many lawyers and parents defend it saying it often offers the only avenue many couples have to obtain a child without years of uncertainty Sandy Lenington of Palo Alto Calif said it took her and her husband seven years to adopt their first child with the help of the Childrens Home Society But it took less than one year when they began looking for a child on their own and ultimately found one with the aid of a lawyer They are now seeking a third child she said and this time we are putting out fliers and having them posted all over town and were sending out our resumes and pictures to doctors and friends Karen Ryer a San Francisco lawyer whose specialties include adoption said People are desperate for children they want Caucasian children and they can afford them The wealthy she said have always been able to buy what they wanted adding Now you see the middle class saving their money to adopt

Art of Discovery By Gerald Weissmann 270 pp New York Times Books 1795 ON the teaching wards of Bellevue Hospital Gerald Weissmann used to teach his students how to look by assigning them Sherlock Holmes Holmes did not provide the perfect text His method of logical deduction largely ignored the clients  the patients  inner life and this for Dr Weissmann a professor of medicine at New York University Medical Center and the very model of a medical humanist is a critical omission As he demonstrated in an earlier collection of essays The Woods Hole Cantata and again in this graceful feisty collection Dr Weissman himself looks simply everywhere the Compleat Clinician peering beyond the sick body part to the person the relationship of the person to the community the relationship of the community to politics ethics history and literature and the relationship of medical science to them all Probably he tells us in the title essay the Gershwin lyric notwithstanding they did not laugh at Christopher Columbus when he said the Earth was round most European navigators were persuaded of that theory by 1492 Still it was only a theory To make it a fact was to make in Dr Weissmanns view a true transmutation of discovery into art It is the art form he loves He feels the promise of adventure of voyages of discovery nearpalpable each morning he says when the laboratory doors are opened A specialist in inflammation he introduces us to Concepcion Diaz a patient who lies in a Bellevue intensivecare unit a hitech topiary an arbor of plastic vines and cables suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus a disease in which immune systems attack the blood vessels the result is inflammation a bodily process of defense against injury but one that is here misdirected Considering her case he describes what wondrous lessons about inflammation have been learned from the common sea sponge We are pikers he assures us compared to the sponge which can regrow a severed part  the greatest of all biological tricks lost to us mammals when we came ashore By way of Seymour Paley a patient whom he treated for asthma 30 years ago he traces the waxings and wanings of psychosomatic theories of disease In the 1930s the asthmatic attack was explained in purely organic terms In the 1950s it signified a repressed cry for the mother fully elaborated in the psychoanalytic literature In the 1980s he says we are back to the organic and immunogenetics is thought to determine who shall wheeze and who shall not We fail to recognize the tentative narrative myth of scientific explanations at our own risk they are as transient as the structure of recollection Everything connects A chapter on current sociobiological theory which proposes a genetic model for human behavior a theory of which Dr Weissmann is not persuaded The miserable record of misused biology since Darwin should make us modest indeed in our claims connects to a recapitulation of the old naturenurture controversy and the question of its future resolution which connects to a chapter on the genebabble of the Nazi doctors which connects to the use and misuse of science in various times and places to buttress existing social orders At the bedside of Mrs Williams a young drug addict who is dying of AIDS fully half of the patients on Bellevues prison ward are similarly afflicted he ponders a terrible irony he does not doubt a cure or a preventive vaccine will be found vaccines using recombinant DNA are being tested now on animals But the most desperate scientific effort to find it has begun in a time of such profound fear of science as to make the effort harder a time in which religious fundamentalism antivivisectionism and fear of genetic engineering have forged one of those periodic strange bedfellowships of the political left and right THE fear of science is nothing if not legitimate he adds Lawyers did not create thermonuclear bombs nor were the gas chambers at Auschwitz designed by

BABY M'S FUTURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/weekinreview/baby-m-s-future.html,LAST week in a decision that created law in the legislative vacuum surrounding surrogate motherhood Judge Harvey R Sorkow of New Jersey Superior Court awarded custody of oneyearold Baby M to William Stern the childs natural father and his wife Elizabeth He stripped Mary Beth Whitehead the surrogate mother of all parental rights and ruled that the contract she had signed with the Sterns  and reneged on  was legal Judge Sorkow explained that existing state adoption and child welfare laws are silent on the issues raised in the case To make a new concept fit into an old statute makes tortured law with equally tortured results he wrote The trial believed to be the first in this country involving both parties to a surrogacy agreement has evoked months of intense and often emotional debate on the legality morality and ethics of surrogate motherhood Judge Sorkows decision will not lay the matter to rest Mrs Whitehead has appealed his decision and a number of states are considering legislation to regulate surrogacy Iver Peterson a reporter for The New York Times asked legal experts ethicists religious leaders public figures and others for their thoughts on the decision Excerpts from the interviews follow WILLIAM HANDEL Director Center for Surrogate Parenting Beverly Hills Calif Surrogate parenting is here to stay and this decision is clearly the legitimization of it    I tell my clients that this is only one judge in one court in one state but people see it as a national thing The only thing close to the impact of this decision that I can think of is the Scopes trial that was only one state too but the sociological and psychological impact of it was nationwide It is exactly the same in this one because this decision represents society coming to terms with new definitions of parenting new definitions of childrens relations to their parents because biology is no longer the only factor BARBARA KATZ ROTHMAN Sociologist at City University of New York and Baruch College Its terribly sad and terribly frightening to see a state in the business of upholding these contracts Its sad enough that weve constructed for ourselves a world in which motherhood is up for sale but its just terrifying to me that the state will uphold a contract that says that the woman with the stretch marks is not the mother    It is not a triumph for women it is not in the interests of women because surrogate parenting is a solution to a rich mans problem not his wifes SENATOR ALBERT GORE JR Democrat of Tennessee and vice chairman of Congresss Biomedical Ethics Board The Baby M case deals with values so deeply engrained in our society that no single court case decision can be looked to as a solution    We need to accelerate the development of a consensus But it must emerge from a broad discussion It cannot come from a decree issued from the top This court decision and any reviews of it in higher courts will probably be applicable only to this particular case and cannot serve as a broad public policy Individual states will no doubt rush to legislate on these matters It would be important and helpful to all if the Congressional Biomedical Ethics Board would designate these issues as topics for priority study and action The board would be an ideal national forum for attempting to forge a consensus GEORGE J ANNAS Professor of health law at Boston University School of Public Health My immediate reaction was that the judge went way overboard on the contract issue but that the custody stuff was more reasonable His statements were extremely sweeping unnecessarily broad and a lot of them were internally inconsistent The first notion that surrogate motherhood is the female equivalent of sperm donation is just silly Egg donation is the female equivalent of sperm donation    The second major conceptual problem he has is not explaining why if you cant constitutionally permit a woman to alienate her right to abortion during pregnancy its OK to permit her to alienate her right to rear a child before the child is born    When he gets to the right to procreate and to rear the child all he talks about are Mr Sterns rights He never compares them to Mary Beth Whiteheads rights The third point is his notion that the father cant buy the baby because its already his    Whats really being transferred here is Mary Beth Whiteheads right to rear the child And the person its being transferred to is not the husband not the father but the fathers wife LORI ANDREWS Research attorney for the American Bar Foundation and author of New Conception I think it was a very brave decision I think it would have been a lot easier for the judge to give some kind of visitation rights to Mary Beth Whitehead or make some other compromise to appease the adult at the expense of the child It is important to remember that the only reason the child is on earth is because of the Sterns desire for the child They wanted the child as part of their family I think that as a result of this decision we will begin to see surrogate arrangements being provided more in a clinical or nonprofit setting It has been in the hands of commercial entrepreneurs until now because they were the only ones who were willing to take that risk and they charged more for that risk because it was in a gray area where we did not even know if it was legal BETTY FRIEDAN Author of The Feminine Mystique and founding president of the National Organization for Women I think that this whole thing has to be taken out of the realm of contract law that is based on the male model of corporate stocks and commodity trading and perhaps make this a voluntary arrangement taking the surrogacy pimps making money making the profits out of the arrangements We also need new rules that say that any man going into this would have to know that the woman should not be held to any agreement to give up her baby even though he would certainly be able to have some relationship with the child which is more than the Sterns and that judge were willing to give Mary Beth Whitehead But if the woman wants to keep the baby you would have to assume that the claim of the woman who has carried the baby for nine months should take precedence over the claim of the man who has donated one of his 50 million sperm PEGGY PRESSLER Surrogate mother and a founding member of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers I think the decision is wonderful We were all a little awestruck at first because we didnt expect to see the decision handed down on the validity of the contract itself because the judge could easily have kicked it back and said You go get some legislative rules on this first Its the first step in opening up the floodgates to surrogate parenting Sorkow is a family court judge and the fact that he saw validity in this that we do have a right to make our own decisions on procreation like this is a real plus ELIZABETH KANE Early surrogate mother who now regrets giving up her son in 1960 I was just drained by the decision I feel as if somebody died When I heard the news that Mary Beth had lost all visitation rights I suddenly thought of how my son looked the last time I saw him in his cradle when he was two days old and I thought of all the Christmases and all his birthdays without him and all the grief Ive gone through and I thought Oh my God Mary Beth is going to have to go through all that too I was just crushed REPRESENTATIVE TED WEISS Democrat of New York member of the Select Committee on Children Youth and Families This was a relatively easy case on a factual basis despite all the emotion But it was a threshold case which forces everybody to think further about this issue even if you agree with the decision as I do Its clear this is a very very complex area with a lot still to be resolved in future cases What happens if you get a situation where you dont have a healthy baby for instance These will have to be resolved both in the courts and in legislative struggles around the country JAY KATZ Professor of law and psychoanalysis Yale University Law School It seems to me that there could be confusion over whether the judge only made the decision with respect to Baby M in the light of the dispute between the Sterns and the Whiteheads or whether he was also promulgating new laws I think he did both and I think that is unfortunate because the issues to be determined in the Baby M situation may not necessarily be generalized Justice Holmes once said that hard cases make bad law Baby M is a hard case WILLIAM FELDMAN Rabbi Jewish Center of Teaneck NJ and author of Health and Medicine in the Jewish Tradition Im a little bit with the feminists on this one because the mother is not a surrogate at all She is the childs mother in every sense and she should be able to change her mind Jewish law says that the mothers status is an inalienable right and here there is a decision that alienates the inalienable and negotiates the nonnegotiable She should be able to say now that her bonding and attachment have developed in this way I renege JEREMY RIFKIN President of the Foundation on Economic Trends an environmental group critical of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies What youve got here is the new eugenics movement The intention here is not evil Everybody wants to do the best thing But the longterm implication is profoundly disturbing    These alternative reproductive technologies are going hand in hand with the genetic screening and mapping thats going on    If a parent knows that their egg or their sperm is going to result in the potential for a genetic disorder or a genetic disease theyre going to feel they owe their child the best possible break by going to these alternative reproductive technologies    Because they allow you to go to other wombs other eggs other sperms other embryos in order to eliminate problems with your offspring By honoring that contract he basically made a decision that alternative reproductive technology is contractually legitimate So in a commercial sense he has legitimized the contractual basis of renting a womb    DAVID LIEDERMAN Executive director of the Child Welfare League of America Obviously the impact of surrogate parenting on the child is the concern we have In this case its very complicated I struggled with it myself In some ways the judge was trying to act in the best interests of the child in keeping the child bonded to one party in the dispute I would always look to it in terms of the best interests of the child  what would help the child have stability who is the child support system The child in this case is so young that it is important to establish some of that this child needs consistent handling and love An older child would be more impacted by the publicity but hopefullly we wont get into that because legislators and chief executives will set up some ground rules for surrogacy  if they decide we should have it    THE REV EDWARD M BRYCE Director of prolife activities for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Baby M has been born into the world by a couple who are not married to each other In lieu of a marriage contract the parents fashioned a commercial contract that tried to paper over the real human responsibilities surrounding procreation All of the pain that attends childlessness and all of the pain that attends relinquishing ones own child are now of necessity joined for the father and the mother in this unwise and immoral experiment Yet to be weighed however is the pain of the child The forces that are at work here are not to be reduced to using the strength and power of the state to hold a woman to a contract that does violence to her own humanity and the bonds of a mother to her child are a lot deeper than the 200yearold experiment we call the United States of America and the Constitution HILARY HANAFIN Counselor at the Center for Surrogate Parenting Beverly Hills Calif If this opinion has any impact on surrogate motherhood I think it will make surrogate mothers feel a little safer Now we sit down with them and say that they are on the frontier  that they have no legal status there is no law And if anything this decision will make surrogates feel some comfort in a precedent that says what they are doing is all right DANIEL CALLAHAN Director The Hastings Institute a research center on ethics in medicine and biology There is an interesting paradox in a lot of the talk about surrogate motherhood On the one hand its being sold on the basis that the biological ties of the surrogates to the baby is not very important that the women can give up the baby without any problem And on the other hand the William Sterns of this world are telling us that the biological tie is all important Now which one is it going to be TERRY EASTLAND Public affairs director for the Justice Department Speaking as an observer it seems to me that the issue is less a legal one than a moral one As in some other areas dealing with the beginnings and end of human life our technological abilities seem greater than our moral insights This may well be an area in which we may wish to decide as a moral matter not to do what technology may permit LAWRENCE STONE Professor of history Princeton University Contracts should be fulfilled This is a rather bizarre contract I agree Youre renting out your body But one expects a prostitute to fufill a contract The difference is that this baby is being born Im not particularly disturbed by the biological parent not having the child Abandoned children and foster parents were very common in the past    However its very clear that modern technology has added an ethical dimension It doesnt greatly matter what the decision of the judge is because one abides by the law What was intolerable was not knowing whether surrogate contracts are moral or ethical or legal even and that we had no law The problem is that technology is leaping ahead of moral and legal structures
THE DEVIL'S OWN CENTURY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/the-devil-s-own-century.html,THE THANATOS SYNDROME By Walker Percy 372 pp New York Farrar Straus  Giroux 1795 WALKER PERCY has availed himself of the knowledge the prophet Jonah had to learn the hard way The novelist writes about the coming end in order to warn about present ills and so avert the end Mr Percy tells us in Notes for a Novel About the End of the World one of his essays collected in The Message in the Bottle 1975 By the end he goes on to explain he means the passing of one age and the beginning of another The novelist setting out to write a serious novel about the end he maintains must reckon not merely like H G Wells with changes in the environment but also with changes in mans consciousness which might be quite as radical The changes in consciousness that engage Mr Percy have to do with our abandonment of God and the concept of the soul for the new religions of science and sociology And in his own two novelistic forays into the prophetic genre he has poked some wicked fun at our selfimportant jargonfilled secular age while at the same time raising some thoughtprovoking questions about where we may be headed next Love in the Ruins published in 1971 described the last days of 1983 Set in a future only nine years away The Thanatos Syndrome is a perceptive mirror of Right Now and an entertaining assault on our societys besetting sins the manipulative and reductionist practices of social science the zeal and selfrighteousness of ultraconservatives the splintering of the Government into clandestine groups often working at cross purposes inside the same organization And though the novels surface action spins along at a brisk thriller pace laced with escapes and chase scenes and risky ingenious detective work including a burlesque episode in which an elusive ring of child abusers is exposed when their own methods are turned against them the real plot as with all this writers fiction chronicles the continuing battle between good and evil in a modern society where both words are out of fashion if not downright suspect BOTH Love in the Ruins and Mr Percys new novel have as their hero or antihero the narrator Dr Tom More the rumpled alcoholic knighterrant Louisiana psychiatrist who prefers to call himself an oldfashioned physician of the soul He is a collateral descendant of St Thomas More the English martyr and author of Utopia He is an older but no less troubled version of Binx Bolling in The Moviegoer 1961 Like Binx he suffers from the malaise Mr Percy visits upon all his heroes a disease with the godless modern world that causes him to despair but also permits him to see what is going on around him better than those who are sunk in everydayness At the beginning of Love in the Ruins Dr Tom More has just returned home after a stay in a mental institution where he has been treated for depression suicidal behavior and failure to adjust The real world that he reenters however seems madder than ever frenzied faddish and schismridden everyone dancing after a different messiah through the crossfire of snipers In other words the novel is a devastatingly accurate satirical portrait of the late 1960s and early 70s though Mr Percy shrewdly situates his ruins in the then more safely distant 80s AT the opening of The Thanatos Syndrome Dr More in his late 50s now has just returned home from Federal prison having served a term for illegally selling drugs to truck drivers to help keep them awake on long hauls and then help them to sleep afterward His time in the clink he confides in the sociable and diffident voice we have come to expect from Mr Percys narrators has taught him a thing or two He doesnt have to diagnose and treat the madness of the world as he attempted to do in Love in the Ruins with his invention the Ontological Lapsometer a caliperlike machine that measured the degree of sickness in a soul through the electrical activity of brain waves Mr Percys sly device for mocking the grandiose designs of literalminded behaviorists Prison does wonders for megalomania More says While there he learned detachment and cultivated a mild lowgrade curiosity Instead of striking pacts with the Devil to save the world    I spent two years driving a tractor pulling a gang mower over sunny fairways    Living a small life gave me leave to notice small things  like certain offcolor spots in the St Augustine grass which I correctly diagnosed as an early sign of chinchbug infestation Instead of saving the world he saved the 18 holes of the officers golf course at the local air base and felt surprisingly good about it    Small disconnected facts if you take note of them have a way of becoming connected Armed with this new little things can be important philosophy the paroled Dr More is the first to notice that something strange is going on in Feliciana Parish his own postage stamp of native soil Not only his old patients but even his wife Ellen is exhibiting bizarre behavior  simplistic speech patterns aggressive sexuality a computerlike capacity for recalling information Ellen has become an overnight bridge champion because she can compute what cards her opponents are holding Conversely these people seem to have lost the very characteristics that made them themselves their old anxieties terrors phobias their idiosyncratic gestures and styles of speaking Now there is a sameness about them a flattening of affect More who has done pioneer work in brain pharmacology puts together one small disconnected fact after another until he becomes convinced that this local syndrome which seems to be killing off peoples selves is being caused by some chemical suppression of the cerebral cortex With the expert assistance of his attractive young cousin Lucy an epidemiologist with a battery of computers in an upstairs room of her old plantation home More tracks the mischief to its source the areas drinking water is being spiked with heavy sodium secretly funneled from a nearby nuclear facility But by whom and why Tom More doesnt have to wait long to find out Realizing he is onto them the

possibilities Mores proselytizer says Putting heavy sodium in the water to improve human behavior isnt all that different from putting fluoride in the water to improve peoples teeth is it He wants More to be their salaried devils advocate Attack us from your own expertise Can Tom name anything wrong with what theyre doing He can Violating civil rights for one thing Not to mention the larger philosophical implications of meddling with free will the right of the individual self to pursue its own heights  or depths One of the main beliefs of both Dr More and Mr Percy who is himself a medical doctor but who has never practiced medicine is that we need our anxieties to discover who we are Do you know why this century has seen such terrible events happen Mores friend Father Smith the priest he met in the mental hospital in Love in the Ruins asks him in The Thanatos Syndrome The Turks killing two million Armenians the Holocaust Hitler killing most of the Jews in Europe Stalin killing fifteen million Ukrainians nuclear destruction unleashed the final war apparently inevitable It is because God agreed to let the Great Prince Satan have his way with men for a hundred years  this one hundred years the twentieth century And he has How did he do it No great evil scenes no demons  hes too smart for that All he had to do was leave us alone We did it Reason warred with faith Science triumphed The upshot One hundred million dead WALKER PERCY has the rare gift of being able to dramatize metaphysics It is this gift that has won him his most devoted readers eager to follow him through book after book turning a kind eye when necessary on his lapses and foibles In the recent novels he often slips into a nuanceless slapdash tempo and the folksy reiterative tone of his narrators can be tiresome in extensive doses And after the memorable greataunt in The Moviegoer and the disquieting Cousin Kate Mr Percys female characters have been disappointing They exist as representative types seen from the outside prone to fickleness and fads or hellbent on marrying or bedding the hero To give Mr Percy credit however he is trying to work his way out of stereotypes in The Thanatos Syndrome At least Cousin Lucy gets to be a doctor but as soon as she has Dr More safely tucked away in her guest room for an overnight stay she turns into a succubus I wish Mr Percy would allow a future female character to worry about the big questions as much as he and his male protagonists do By choice as well as inclination Mr Percy is primarily a novelist of ideas but he is a fine novelist of manners too He is uncommonly good at evoking the atmosphere and language of his region he is dead on target when depicting the subtle often devious locutions of Southern American talk Here is a 75yearold black janitor at the hospital greeting Dr More on his return from prison I knowed they couldnt keep you People talking about trouble I say no way No way Doc going to be in trouble Aint no police going to hold Doc for long People got too much respect for Doc I mean THEN explaining to the reader that one would have to be a Southerner white or black to understand the complexities of this little exchange Dr More translates the janitors greeting Frank was having a bit of fun with me    and he knew that I knew using the old forms of civility to say what he pleased What he was pleased to say was So you got caught didnt you and you got out sooner than I would have didnt you Even his pronunciation of police as police was overdone and farcical a parody of black speech but a parody he calculated I would recognize Actually hes a deacon and uses a kind of churchy English Doctor what were gerng to do is soliciting contributions for a chickendinner benefit    and suchlike If Mr Percys theory about the novelist as prophet is right  that like the canary coal miners used to take down into the mine shafts his job is to test the air and thus help us avert the end  we ought to be able by absorbing the scenarios he has provided us with in The Thanatos Syndrome to outgrow our current sins and be well into new ones by the real 1996 By which time we will be ready for another diagnosis from a prophetnovelist  perhaps again by Mr Percy himself TECHNOLOGICAL HUBRIS I made a point of not rereading Love in the Ruins while I was writing The Thanatos Syndrome  Walker Percy said in a recent telephone interview from his home near New Orleans I took it out this morning for the first time in 15 years and I was amazed at the differences Love in the Ruins is a kind of lighthearted sciencefiction novel that goes off in all directions Its protagonist Dr Tom More he said invented a device that could measure the various degrees to which you had fallen short of your authentic self  all of which is a lot of fun but a lot of nonsense In this book Dr More comes up against some very serious business indeed the real danger of technological hubris Although I hope it has its funny moments the book has a certain anger to it Mr Percy said that More is forced to confront what happens when science and humanity part ways The main issue is to what degree is the sacredness of the individual recognized History he said supplied the theme I was thinking about being in Germany when I was about 18 or 19 in 1934 with my German professor from the University of North Carolina and it occurred to me that it might be a good idea to draw a comparison between the preNazi mentality of doing whats best for society and whats happening now with the terrific increase in technology I wanted to issue a warning You had better remember what happened Like Dr More Mr Percy is also concerned about the toll popular culture can take on the psyche My own private theory he said is that a good deal of the anxiety and depression people experience these days comes from watching television where theres a certain esthetic unity  everything works out My life and yours are much more fragmentary haphazard and incomplete However Mr Percy said there are ways to insure a safe level of exposure to the medium Ive been watching Days of Our Lives for 20 years usually without paying any attention to it There is a certain way of seeing this stuff with perception raised to the second power so to speak And Ill watch Dynasty Falcon Crest or The Colbys  without the sound I think it may be better that way Ive never tried it with the sound KIM HERON
WASHINGTON TALK: THE SURGEON GENERAL; Dr. Koop Defends His Crusade on AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/06/us/washington-talk-the-surgeon-general-dr-koop-defends-his-crusade-on-aids.html,The morning that Dr C Everett Koop went to Congress to testify in favor of condom advertising his wife sent him off with these words Well Im glad your mothers dead And you know the Surgeon General said smiling behind his Captain Ahab beard I know what she meant His mother a sheltered housewife from Brooklyn would never have understood For that matter many people in Washington do not understand Dr Koops extraordinary shift in image from someone who was regarded at the time of his appointment as a right winger and a fervent opponent of abortion to someone who is now so graphically outspoken on an issue like AIDS A Hero or a Failure Many of the liberals who once criticized Dr Koop now praise him Representative Henry Waxman a California Democrat who heads the Health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee used to find the Surgeon General scary Now he calls him a man of heroic proportions On the other side Howard Phillips the chairman of the Conservative Caucus who pushed for Dr Koops confirmation six years ago now says that he has failed in moral courage While President Reagan and most of his top officials either avoid the issue of AIDS or speak brightly of the virtues of sexual abstinence the 70yearold Dr Koop spreads the graphic gospel of AIDS prevention in forums ranging from radio and television talk shows to college commencements Advertising condoms in a tasteful way is a lot different than throwing them from a Mardi Gras float in New Orleans he said sitting in his office the other morning and wearing the goldbraided militarystyle uniform that has made him a familiar figure around town Kids arent dumb  they know about these things he added with exasperation If you go to a drugstore to get a pack of gum youll see a box of condoms next to it Acquired immune deficiency syndrome a fatal viral disease that is spread through intercourse with an infected person or through exchanges of blood as in shared hypodermic needles has killed thousands of male homosexuals and intravenous drug users in this country Dr Koop fiercely wants to strip AIDS of its stigma and stop people from dying To that end he talks baldly about the proper way to use condoms about making an animated educational video that would feature two condoms with little eyes on them chatting and about the need for gentle nonmystifying sex education for students starting in kindergarten He even has a box of anatomically correct dolls in his office that someone has sent along boys with prophylactics in their back pockets and girls with babies inside I dont remember if I was embarrassed the first time I talked about these sort of things he said But Im sure not now An Award Is Rescinded Dr Koops vivid emphasis on science rather than values and his defense of individual rights and confidentiality in opposing mandatory testing for the disease have stunned and enraged many of his former supporters on the right Nellie Gray the chairman of the March for Life last week rescinded an annual award her antiabortion group had given Dr Koop notifying thousands of people on her mailing list that he was retroactively undeserving The doctor has become a lightning rod for one of the most sensitive moral issues in the country How do you talk about sex in a way that is explicit enough to give health information without seeming to condone certain practices Representative William E Dannemeyer a conservative California Republican thinks the Surgeon General may have to be replaced Dr Koops October report to the nation about AIDS could just as well have been directed to the farmers of America about a cattle population inflicted with a disease Mr Dannemeyer said There was no connection between human sexuality and morality On any given day Dr Koop says goodnaturedly a conservative Republican calls to hector him Youve changed they say accusingly I havent he replies You have they insist And it keeps going like that for a while You have I havent  he said He rebuts all such calls with the same answer I am not afforded the luxury of bringing ideology or morals into my job especially with the sort of threat we have with AIDS he said When you walk into a lab to do a sterile technique you do a sterile technique When you walk into a health job you make pronouncements about health based on the facts Were not talking about measles here he added You cant give people a false sense of security And you cant educate anybody about AIDS unless they know about sex Secretary of Education William J Bennett has taken public issue with Dr Koop saying that schools should teach about sex only as part of marriage And White House officials recently confirmed to NBC News that the President has never talked to his Surgeon General about AIDS nor read the report Dr Koop sent him last October Dr Koop is keenly aware of the irony of his situation The world has flipflopped and its bittersweet he said Obviously its gratifying to have people like Senator Edward Kennedy and Henry Waxman saying I have integrity But its bitter to have people who liked me thinking that Ive slipped the traces An Evangelical Christian The worldfamous childrens surgeon who did pioneering work in separating Siamese twins came to the capital in 1981 as a hero of the right an evangelical Christian who had condemned what he considered hedonistic life styles as undermining the family He worried that homosexuality like divorce was an antifamily force pointing out that if two boys live together they dont have any children A man whose deep religious beliefs were a guide for action he said abortion could lead to infanticide and he toured the country with a film featuring a shot of him standing in the Dead Sea salt flats surrounded by a thousand black and white dolls representing the children not born since abortion became legal Liberal groups fighting his appointment to the Surgeon Generals spot dubbed him Dr Kook But after his confirmation Dr Koop chose a different crusade He aroused the ire of many of his conservative supporters  including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina  when he took on the powerful Tobacco Institute and began urging Americans to refrain from cigarettes snuff and chewing tobacco Research for AIDS Report When Dr Koop first began doing research for his AIDS report many homosexuals said they were fearful that it would reflect moral opprobrium They asked for a meeting and found the Surgeon General eager to listen The report turned out to be better than we could have possibly hoped for said Richard Dunne the executive director of the Gay Mens Health Crisis in New York Hes an unlikely hero but on this issue hes a hero and he came along when we really needed him Like others Mr Dunne speculates on the Surgeon Generals evolution or revolution as some call it I think what happened is that the good doc part of his personality and his background came to the fore He got a sense of the human suffering and tragedy and pain and said to himself Im not here to make moral judgments Im here to save people if I can  Dr Koop likes to say he has not changed it is just that people came to know him better Strong Ironies But there are strong ironies The man who was once labeled a right winger now talks about right wingers Some of these people seem more concerned with homosexual genocide and with things like William Buckleys suggestion that AIDS victims be tattooed than with the human tragedy he said When pressed Dr Koop concedes that it is impossible to be in the thick of a public health crisis like AIDS and not be personally touched As you mature in any kind of situation you become more understanding about it he said I hate injustice of any kind and I dont like to see people excoriated in the midst of illness because theres some other part of their life style that people dont like Again he offered a medical analogy If a policeman and a bandit are hurt in a crime shootout and brought into the emergency room I dont ignore the bandit and take care of the cop I take care of the one who needs help the most Although the President in an address last week talked only about abstinence as a remedy for the AIDS epidemic Dr Koop said he was pleased that Mr Reagan talked about the disease at all Maybe theres some light at the end of the tunnel he said His Stance on Abortion Some conservatives were particularly outraged by a recent remark by Dr Koop that seemed to show he had softened his stance on abortion When he recommended that any woman who wants to have a baby should voluntarily be tested for AIDS he was asked whether abortion was an option for a woman who discovered she had the AIDS virus after becoming pregnant If you wanted to give her all the possibilities that were available to her he answered cautiously you would have to mention abortion Sitting in his office the other day Dr Koop repeated the comment that seemed so at odds with his virulent stands of the past Im not changing my position on abortion said the man who once called amniocentesis a search and destroy mission I couldnt get involved in it personally But if a woman wishes to be counseled about abortion thats her privilege Dr Koop was asked if the Reagan Administration got more than it bargained for when it appointed him to his post They certainly got a bargain he replied I did not come here having to prove anything to myself And I was not looking for a sixfigure job afterward I guess what Id like people to say about me when the controversy dies down is that I handled the job with integrity and didnt bow to pressures
KEMP TO SEEK PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/us/kemp-to-seek-presidential-nomination.html,Promising to support a weapons shield in space freedom fighters abroad free enterprise in the marketplace and traditional family values at home Representative Jack F Kemp announced his Presidential candidacy today The conservative Republican Congressman from the Buffalo area said he would extend the moral and optimistic vision of the Reagan revolution but correct its mistakes Like the good shepherd said the neatly coiffed candidate America must reach out to the weak and to those who have fallen behind The house in the Buffalo suburb of Hamburg that the nineterm Congressman keeps in his district here but has never lived in is for sale It seemed symbolic as he returned to the area where he has triumphed in football and in politics a sign that Mr Kemp is determined to trade up to a larger place on Pennsylvania Avenue In the National Race to Stay I love Buffalo  Im shopping for an apartment there said the 51yearold Los Angeles native whose national campaign will preclude his running again for his seat in the House of Representatives But Im in the Presidential race to stay Outside of his own district and about half a dozen other counties in western New York State Mr Kemp has not generated substantial support among the Republican leaders in New York Nine of the 13 New York Republicans in the states Congressional delegation recently endorsed Vice President Bush And most major county leaders in the state while officially neutral have privately pledged support to Mr Bush The states Republican Senator Alfonse M DAmato is counted as a supporter of Senator Bob Dole by New York politicians Buffalo was the fourth rainy Northeastern stop on the first day of an ambitious tour that will take the Congressman his wife Joanne and their four children to 24 cities and 19 states in the next two weeks Rousing Speech in Capitol Mr Kemp began his day with a rousing speech in Washington on Capitol Hill calling freedom the most powerful political idea the world has ever known The stillboyishlooking candidate stood in front of a dozen outsize American flags with his wife his son Jeffrey a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and Jeffs wife Stacey his daughters Judith a college student and Jennifer a teacher and his youngest son James a quarterback for Churchill High School in Bethesda Md The setting was the House Judiciary Committee hearing room Mr Kemp asserted that the country must unite behind a strategy for victory that says we must go beyond containing communism to the ultimate triumph of freedom and democracy When a reporter asked Mr Kemp at a news conference following his announcement about the use of American military force on behalf of freedom fighters he replied No ones asking for US troops Theyre only asking for material and moral and financial support He did not rule out sending troops to Central America saying Circumstances could always change but he stated echoing the phrase used by a reporter I dont think its going to require American blood Stand on Freedom Fighters He said the United States should legitimize the freedom fighter movement I think we should derecognize the Government of Nicaragua and recognize the contras as a government in exile he said In Nicaragua in Angola in Ethiopia in Mozambique Id like to see the American Congress be consistently on the side of the men and women fighting for freedom With a large entourage of staff supporters and press on a Boeing 727 the party then traveled to Manchester NH Boston and Buffalo Mr Kemp said he was not worried about the polls that show him favored by about 7 percent of Republican primary voters behind Vice President Bush and Senator Dole He also said he was not concerned about the fallout from the Iran arms affair Theres no doubt Iran is a stain on the President but I dont think its fatal he said in New Hampshire I dont think the American people will focus on Iran in 1988 and punish the Republican Party Wide Range of Positions He declared himself in favor of the President Reagans missile shield plan called Strategic Defense Initiative and against abortion in favor of mandatory testing for AIDS for couples who want to get married and against trade sanctions He reiterated his economic belief that more growth more jobs lower interest rates and less government spending were the answer to most economic problems including the Federal deficit and trade inequities On the abortion issue he said he was 100 percent prolife and would work to protect the unborn by appointing judges who uphold our JudeoChristian values and continuing to seek constitutional protection for human life He said his candidacy would be a referendum on the deployment on the Strategic Defense Initiative As important as it was to put a man on the moon at the end of the 60s it is more important now to defend our country and our allies in

ON THE FRONTIERS OF BRAIN SURGERY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/science/on-the-frontiers-of-brain-surgery.html,RELYING on new concepts of the human brain scientists are progressing rapidly in experiments with nervecell transplants that promise to halt and perhaps cure a variety of devastating brain disorders Just as hearts livers and corneas can be transplanted into people whose organs are failing tiny chunks of nerve tissue can be implanted into people whose brains are failing because they lack certain cells and the chemicals they secrete Last week for example a team of Mexican researchers reported that they had halted the progression of Parkinsons disease in two patients by implanting new cells into their brains Although this is the only success in humans reported so far widespread research in animals is under way that scientists hope will eventually produce human treatments Researchers in the United States Sweden and China have cured animals of Parkinsons symptoms and are working on methods to reverse other degenerative conditions such as Huntingtons chorea and Alzheimers disease as well as paralysis caused by stroke and spinal cord injuries Although the Parkinsons work employed tissue from the adrenal gland most animal experiments involve the use of brain cells taken from aborted animal fetuses Similar experiments in humans using human fetal brain cells are under way or planned in several countries including Sweden and China Experiments using human fetal tissue raise profound and divisive ethical issues issues that will loom ever larger if successful therapies emerge The question of abortion and when it is acceptable cannot be avoided although spontaneous or medically required abortions could be the source of some fetal tissue elective abortions would probably be the largest source Once a fetus has been aborted for whatever reason who has the right to decide whether the tissue can be used for medical purposes If fetal tissue had a market value would that encourage more abortions At what point should a fetus that has been determined to be nonviable even with the best medical assistance be declared dead and its stillliving brain cells be used in transplants These and other related questions are receiving intensive scrutiny by experts in medical ethics In any case scientists caution it may be years before any of the research advances are ready for widespread application in the treatment of disease There is a lot of optimism and enthusiasm that is somewhat tempered by the concern that the public is going to get too fired up too quickly said Dr Eugene Redmond an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University who is a leading researcher in the field Still even the researchers seem flabbergasted at their own success For 100 years scientists have tried in vain to transplant brain tissue Ten years ago according to Dr Dennis Landis an associate professor of neurobiology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Not only was this not in our wildest imaginations  it was blatant fiction No one would have believed it said Dr Barry Hoffer a professor of pharmacology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center If I were to tell a fellow scientist back then that I took fetal brain cells and placed them near the area of a lesion and that the cells survived grew and reversed disease symptoms well it would have smacked of Mary Shelley creator of Dr Frankenstein and his monster he said When they hear the term braincell transplant people do tend to think of Frankenstein said Dr John Sladek chairman of neurobiology at the University of Rochester who says he is worried about public misinterpretation of the methods But we are putting in infinitesimally small amounts of tissue and charting how it can integrate within existing brain structures that are many thousands of times larger New Knowledge of Human Brain Several converging lines of research have prompted the turnabout according to Dr Sladek It is now known that human adult brains even 80yearold ones are extremely plastic That is brain cells continue to migrate make connections and stimulate targets  including transplanted cells  throughout life Scientists have also learned that fetal cells are somehow able to continue growing after transplantation making them much more useful than adult brain cells used in the past And they have also learned although they do not understand exactly how the process works that a substance implanted in one spot in the brain can influence chemical actions in distant areas Today scientists do not look for pointtopoint connections between existing and transplanted cells as they did in the past Their goal is to promote functional rather than anatomical change The strategy is to implant cells that excrete chemicals exactly where they are normally produced in the brain Many drugs provide missing chemicals but also affect the entire brain producing unwanted side effects Tiny drugcontaining pumps have been implanted into the brains of humans and animals but they can cause damage and need to be refilled according to Dr Richard Wyatt of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda Md Furthermore braincell implants appear to tap into the brains own nerve growth factors newly discovered substances made in the brain that help nerve cells survive grow in the right directions and make new connections 5 Types of Cells Studied Five types of cells are now being investigated for transplantation They are  Cells from the adrenal glands These glands one on each kidney secrete a chemical similar to that missing in the brains of Parkinsons patients Using these cells is advantageous because the patient can spare tissue from one adrenal gland and will not reject the transplant because it is part of his own body Use of adrenal cells also avoids the ethical dilemmas of using fetal tissue On the other hand adrenal cells are not true nerve cells and may not grow and make new connections in the brain They may also provide an opening into the brain for substances normally excluded by the bloodbrain barrier a tissue network that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances circulating in the blood  Human fetal cells These are the preferred cells medically speaking In all animal experiments thus far on Parkinsons disease fetal cells work better than adrenal cells according to Dr Fred Gage an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of California at San Diego Fetal tissue is dynamic When placed into a host brain it follows the correct genetic program for making connections and secreting chemicals Nor does fetal tissue seem to be rejected by the host It somehow integrates itself into the adult brain The problem of course is that fetal tissue would have to be taken from healthy fetuses that are legally dead but whose brain tissue is still viable Researchers say the controversy over the ethical issues is bound to be explosive Based on animal experiments scientists believe useful tissue could be obtained from fetuses from the middle three months of pregnancy up to birth  Animal fetal cells Research is under way to render such tissue immunologically silent so that it is not rejected by a human recipient  Human fetal cells grown in test tubes Artificially propagated nerve cells could one day be banked  Human cancer cells Some of these cells release desired brain chemicals and can be kept alive in test tubes But for reasons that are not understood they stop producing the chemicals after implantation Of course a mechanism would have to be devised to prevent them from producing cancer Early Parkinsons Experiments Parkinsons disease was the first candidate for braincell transplantation because it is caused by the loss of a single brain chemical dopamine within a welldefined area of the brain The loss leaves victims of the disease unable to regulate body movements Scientists do not know what causes dopamine cells to die in Parkinsons patients But a tragic turn of events among drug addicts has shed light on the matter In the late 1970s a number of young men and women developed advanced cases of the disease Their bodies grew stiff virtually overnight The cause turned out to be a contaminant of homemade Demerol a narcotic being sold on the streets Using the chemical scientists could produce the disease in animals treat them in various ways and then study the results Last spring Dr Redmond and Dr Sladek succeeded in curing green monkeys of Parkinsons by transplanting dopamineproducing monkey fetus cells into their brains Researchers at the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke as well as at national primate centers in Seattle and Atlanta have done the same with other primates Buoyed by early successful animal experiments a team of researchers in Sweden implanted adrenal tissue into four patients in 1982 and 1984 with disappointing results Mexican researchers changed the procedure gaining wider access to the brain and seem to be getting better results A team in China has reportedly transplanted human fetal cells into Parkinsons patients and is expected to give first details of the procedure at a medical meeting in the United States in June But there are many unanswered questions about these first human experiments In the the Mexican experiment scientists are not sure whether the implanted tissue is producing dopamine directly or somehow stimulating the brain to do so Some experts speculate that the incision of surgery itself rather than the transplanted tissue might explain the therapeutic result  And according to research by Dr Jeffrey Rosenstein of George Washington University the transplanted tissue may be vulnerable over the long term to substances in the patients own blood Finally the disease process may kill the transplanted cells just as it killed original cells Other brain diseases are even harder to deal with The first order of business researchers say is to learn their fundamental causes Only then can transplant techniques be applied Huntingtons chorea an inherited disease in which a part of the brain called the caudate is destroyed has been reversed in rats Dr Gage said Entire fetal caudates were transplanted into animals whose caudates had been removed he said with the result that the new tissue connected and looked remarkably good Alzheimers disease which involves many cell types throughout the brain may never be amenable to brain cell transplant according to most experts today But Dr Gage and others have transplanted fetal neurons containing certain brain chemicals associated with memory into aged animals with the result that the old animals memories improved Such techniques might lessen the effects of Alzheimers disease Perhaps the most dramatic contribution of braincell transplants might be to new victims of strokes and spinal cord injuries Several strategies are being considered Stroke victims for example are often left with a small portion of the brain that does not recover Scientists might implant donor tissue containing the same cell types into the damaged area hoping that the new cells will restore normal brain function Nerve growth factors might also be used to induce nearby surviving cells to make new connections Cell implants might not even be needed Most Difficult Challenge Spinal cord injuries will be the toughest nut to crack said Dr Hoffer The spinal cord for unknown reasons is more hostile to nerve implants than is the brain Researchers propose bathing the site of injury with nervegrowth factors implanting donor tissue or a synthetic material and letting the nerves reconnect over this implanted bridge But the treatment would have to be perdone almost immediately before distant nerve cells began to atrophy and die A major concern with the new techniques researchers in the field say is that they may raise false hopes among people who have been paralyzed for many years or who have advanced cases of incurable neurological diseases It will take many years to develop braincell transplant techniques into everyday clinical practice researchers say In the meantime there is ample opportunity to debate the medical and ethical issues raised by the techniques
HIGH COURT WIDENS REVIEW OF ABORTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/us/high-court-widens-review-of-abortion-law.html,The Supreme Court today broadened its review of the constitutionality of an Illinois law that restricted minors access to abortions The Justices are considering an appeal of a lower courts decision that struck down part of the law The Illinois statute requires unmarried minors seeking abortions to notify both parents at least 24 hours beforehand unless they can persuade a state judge they are mature enough to make their own decisions or that it would be in their best interests to bypass the parental notificiation requirement Todays decision was the latest of a series of unusual actions by the Court on the appeal The case has implications for laws in about 20 states that restrict the access of minors to abortions About half the laws are not being enforced because of lawsuits Other states are considering legislation In a brief order the Court told lawyers in the case to submit new legal briefs addressing an issue that the Court had specifically declined to review last October Todays order followed the Courts abrupt cancellation late last month of an oral argument in the case that had been scheduled to take place April 1 Rescheduling of Arguments The Court indicated today that the oral argument would be rescheduled to take place in the Courts next term in October That would be almost two years after the Attorney General of Illinois Neil F Hartigan filed the states appeal with the Supreme Court Lawyers in the case said the Courts actions were confusing Some who support broad access to abortions for minors and who had hoped the Court would dismiss the states appeal as unripe for review said that todays order did not bode well for their side Janet Benshoof a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union said the order was a dangerous sign that the Court might be reaching out for a basis on which to reverse the lower court and uphold the Illinois law Last October when the Court first agreed to hear the Illinois appeal Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 it said it would consider only the constitutionality of the requirement that the parents be notified 24 hours in advance The Justices said at that time that they would not review the issue of whether the laws procedures for judicial bypass of the entire parental notificiation requirement provided a constitutionally sufficient framework for insuring confidential and expedited appeals The Courts separation of the two issues in its October order puzzled some lawyers in the case They said it made little sense to consider the first issue independently of the second Today contrary to its October order the Court told lawyers in the case to submit new briefs discussing the judicial bypass issue as well as the waitingperiod issue The Court also told the lawyers to discuss whether the Federal appeals court decision in the case is sufficiently final to permit this Court to take jurisdiction

NEW YORK FOSTER CARE: A PUBLIC-PRIVATE BATTLEGROUND,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/09/nyregion/new-york-foster-care-a-public-private-battleground.html,The public and private agencies that run New York Citys besieged foster care system are deeply split over who should control the system and whether major changes are needed in its structure The head of the Human Resources Administration William Grinker says that in the long run the city will have to take more direct control rather than as is currently the case turning over almost all the children to 57 private agencies hired under contract But the leaders of those agencies many affiliated with the citys major religious groups insist that the problem is not the balance between public and private but rather the failure of city and state officials to provide firm leadership and adequate resources Growing Caseload The struggle among those who deliver foster care services comes at a time when the system is straining under a growing caseload of neglected and abused youngsters The conflict critics of the system maintain is complicating efforts to improve services to the 17500 youngsters in foster care or even find enough beds for all of them Its one of the major contributing factors to the bed crisis said David Tobis an expert on foster care at the Welfare Research Institute a New York City think tank The solution he said is greater city control of the system Even government officials who are nominally in charge are saying that a major part of the problem is that the system is complex unwieldy and not really under anyones control I just cant say Do it and it gets done Mr Grinker said There is a diffusion of responsibility and control that makes it difficult to manage When you want to change something to make the system more efficient or more effective there are an awful lot of steps Government Agencies Are Faulted But Msgr Robert A Arpie the director of child care for the Archdiocese of New York said this was the fault of the city and state not the private agencies I think the agencies function unbelievably well under the most adverse circumstances he said Monsignor Arpie asserted it was the city that failed to gear up for the rapid increase in the number of children up 1000 in the last year And he characterized the citys Special Services for Children the division of the Human Resources Administration that places youngsters as an unmanageable circus where the people dont talk with one another and dont have information about the children Officials of the Jewish agencies also fault the government for not providing adequate leadership planning and money The executive vice president of the Jewish Child Care Association of New York David Roth said a frequent vacuum had been created by the turnover of commissioners at the city agency Mr Grinker who took office four months ago is the sixth person to hold the post in the Koch administration I think the Mayors office and the HRA commissioner have to provide leadership Mr Roth said While acknowledging that the city had to strengthen its own management even within the current structure Mr Grinker said Over the long run we have to have a more balanced system  a better mix of public and private responsibility You dont put all your eggs in one basket Though New York City is legally responsible for children in foster care the city actually provides little of the services the youngsters receive Only about 1700 youngsters are housed in cityoperated foster homes The remaining children are distributed literally allocated in a process that often resembles a human bazaar  among the 57 agencies that care for the children under contracts worth 300 million a year A 15yearold Protestant girl who had given birth a year earlier was sent to the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin a foster care center on Staten Island run by the archdiocese She told administrators there that she was sexually active but they refused to provide her with birth control services When she obtained birth control pills on her own administrators took them away A few months later she became pregnant again 1973 Lawsuit A Protestant teenager was at the top of a list for placement in a group home run by a Jewish agency but the spot was taken by a Jewish youngster lower on the list The teenager had to go instead to a group home run by the city that did not have the supervision or the care for which the Jewish agency was known The teenager dropped out of the program and ended up in prison on a weapons charge Those are not hypothetical cases They are just a few of the stories from the bulging files of a lawsuit brought in 1973 that goes to the heart of the issue of control and decision making in the foster care system The lawsuit Wilder v Bernstein was brought by the Americian Civil Liberties Union on behalf of 13yearold Shirley Wilder and other foster children The suit asserts that foster care agencies run by Jews and Catholics often favored their own and that as a result Protestant children nearly all of them black received inferior care Control Is at Issue In some ways time has passed the original point of the case At least 85 percent of the children in the system now are black and Hispanic and race is no longer the central dispute But the case has been kept alive by the issue of control The Catholic agencies want to continue to exercise their religious principles which firmly reject premarital sex birth control and abortion The Archdiocese of New York is headed by John Cardinal OConnor probably the leading spokesman for Catholic orthodoxy in the United States The Jewish agencies want to continue to give preference in admission to the less than 2 percent of the children in the system who are Jewish Virtually all of them are sent to Jewish foster care institutions which are about 30 percent Jewish As a result of those concerns the Catholic and Jewish agencies have appealed a settlement of the Wilder lawsuit agreed to in court last month by the city and the ACLU Accord Would Shift Power to City The accord would require that the agencies take youngsters on a firstcome firstserve basis without regard to race or religion It also would mandate full access to familyplanning services including birth control and abortion It would mean a shift in the balance of power to the city Cardinal OConnor illustrated the depth of his concern about maintaining whatever discretion over the system he currently has by threatening to withdraw services from the 2500 youngsters now in group homes run by Catholic agencies Much of his anger was directed at the ACLU Will the ACLU stop with childcare institutions he said in a recent speech in Washington We expect nursing homes to be next and then our hospitals How long can we fight the legal battle that already has cost us a fortune Nonetheless last month as the deadline to appeal the decision approached the Cardinal joined the Jewish agencies in asking the courts to review the settlement thus delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from the system Monsignor Arpie said the issue for the Archdiocese was not just one of control but of religious purpose We must maintain our religious principles he said Religion for us is the fundamental from which we spring If it werent for our religiousness we wouldnt be in this business The ACLU however asserts that the Catholic and Jewish agencies are in effect hiding behind their faiths The religious agencies are resisting changes that will make them really accountable said the director of the Childrens Rights Project at the ACLU Marcia Robinson Lowry Ms Lowry said that under the current system the private agencies using the discretion they say they need to preserve religious principles were actually turning away hardtohandle children of all religions Those children eventually end up in cityoperated foster care centers of lower quality she said Under the accord the agencies will not be able to pick and choose anymore she said The agencies say that taking away their discretion will be a breach of the independence under which they have worked for more than 100 years In exchange for that independence the city has gotten better quality foster care for far less than it would have cost if it tried to create the system itself the agencies said Children Are Followed By Societys Problems Long before there was any public involvement in foster care private charity was there In the second half of the 19th century orphanages proliferated to care for the children left destitute in the aftermath of the Civil War The Mission of the Immaculate Virgin had its beginnings in 1870 as St Vincents Home for Homeless Newsboys The Jewish child care agencies of today date their history to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum founded in 1860 Laws that required protection for abused and neglected children came in the late 1800s Advocates for children point out that those laws came after animal protection laws were enacted Still religious groups tended to take care of their own and donations paid almost the entire costs Over the years however the issues in society began to change The first children who filled orphanages were there because they lost their parents to disease shipwrecks or battle They were wideeyed hopeful youngsters looking for love and a fresh start Their dream was to get out of the orphanage and into a foster care home their wildest fantasy was adoption in which they would be part of a family without the threat of returning to an institution While youngsters such as those still exist in foster care institutions today many of them are also scarred by drugs criminal records and abuse at home They are often in foster care because their families can no longer control or sustain them Adoption is not part of their vocabulary their dream is to grow up and get out of the system On weekends the foster care group homes are empty Teenagers return to their families and often to the crime and blight they had left Monsignor Arpie said foster care institutions are asked to step in when all else in society fails the family social service agencies the school system and the courts But the children do not leave societys problems behind when they enter the foster care system Monsignor Arpie said it is often on their weekends away from the institutions that the girls in foster care become pregnant When this happens the response illustrates the delicate  and difficult balance that exists between the city and the religious agencies If the girl insists on an abortion the staff of the Catholic home will not cooperate beyond telephoning the Human Resources Administration to let city officials know of her wish A city car comes and takes the girl to the hospital for the abortion and then drives her back In effect the church looks the other way while the city steps in to see that another child is not added to the foster care system
WITNESS TO THE CENTURY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/books/witness-to-the-century.html,OUT OF STEP An Unquiet Life in the 20th Century By Sidney Hook 628 pp New York Harper  Row 2995 SIDNEY HOOK was born in 1902 so his unquiet life has not only been lived entirely in the present century but has spanned most of it Despite his early choice of academic philosophy as a profession he has scarcely pursued a primarily contemplative existence he has sought out and witnessed sometimes as a participant some of the centurys most climactic events During a year of study abroad in 192829 he observed Nazi rallies in Munich and street confrontations between Nazis and Communists in Berlin presciently doubting the almost universal opinion in those deceptively serene years that Hitler is finished He spent a summer in Moscow as one of the first Western scholars to do research at the famous MarxEngels Institute but he picked up only faint intimations of the beginnings of Stalins terror Back in the United States Mr Hook plunged into leftwing politics with the coming of the Depression publicly supporting the Communist Partys Presidential ticket in 1932 and although he never joined the party he engaged in private discussions with Earl Browder and other leading Communists who valued him as the most prominent and promising American academic intellectual to embrace Marxism Mr Hook devotes a whole chapter to a strange episode in early 1933 when Browder seemed to sound him out about organizing a group to engage in scientific and industrial espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union If Mr Hook was one of the first outstanding American intellectuals to support the Communists he was also one of the first to turn against them a year or two before they won wide popularity after 1935 with their new Popular Front antifascist line Although never a Trotskyist Mr Hook helped found an independent radical party that later merged with Trotskys followers he also persuaded his teacher and philosophical mentor John Dewey to head the famous Commission of Inquiry Into the Truth of the Moscow Trials which revealed the monstrous fraudulence of Stalinist justice After the war Mr Hook became a leading figure in the American Committee for Cultural Freedom created after he organized a protest against the Communistsponsored Waldorf Peace Conference of 1949 I recall seeing him at a New York University faculty meeting in the stormy spring of 1970 valiantly and articulately  but fruitlessly  opposing what he considered spinelessly opportunistic capitulation to student political agitation All of these events are recounted in Out of Step Most are assigned separate chapters But Mr Hook does not neglect his academic career There are portraits of Morris Cohen and Dewey the teachers who most influenced him and of Bertrand Russell He is sparing in summarizing his own philosophical views having amply presented them elsewhere Nevertheless I am reminded once again of how fully Mr Hook anticipated by several decades the more subtle flexible and voluntaristic versions of Western Marxism that have today completely supplanted orthodox MarxismLeninism among academic Marxists in Europe and America Mr Hook also relates his encounters with other memorable people mostly met in the course of his political activities  including Max Eastman Whittaker Chambers Bertolt Brecht Jacques Maritain the Partisan Review circle Albert Einstein and Arthur Koestler Lionel Trilling introduced him in the early 1930s to Chambers who shrewdly complained afterward that Mr Hook was not to be trusted as a radical because he had a SocialDemocratic face Mr Hooks exchanges with Einstein to which a full chapter is devoted have a certain comic ring for they largely involved tireless but unsuccessful efforts on Mr Hooks part to persuade the great physicist to take a forthright public stand against Communism and the Soviet Union Though often sharply critical of the opinions and on occasion the actions of a wide range of people Mr Hook is for the most part fair and even generousminded in discussing them His references to literary men and women are an exception for they are almost invariably at best patronizing at worst curtly dismissive The literary mind he repeatedly intimates is just not capable of achieving a balanced understanding of political and social issues and is incurably prone to succumb to fashionable opinion or to indulge in irresponsible Bohemian posturing I have myself often been infuriated by literary peoples facile moralizing about politics but Mr Hooks animadversions as others have pointed out before seem rooted in an utter tonedeafness to verbal playfulness and even to the claims of the imagination These tendencies are most pronounced in a curmudgeonly chapter on the authors association with Partisan Review he virtually claims that its editors took the correct political position only when they listened to him Essentially he pictures them as unserious radical comedians poseurs pretending to be revolutionaries while they led a safe life in the culture they decried made no sacrifices endured no discomfort One is driven to remark that granting his intellectual courage in taking on all comers in debate before any audience Mr Hook himself was hardly a selfdenying underground disturber of the peace throughout his career he held a secure academic position which incidentally the Partisan Review editors did not IT also reveals the lack of a sense of proportion to insist that Partisan Review was less influential in presenting antiCommunist views to liberal intellectuals than The New Leader The opinions and judgments of Edmund Wilson George Orwell Arthur Koestler Hannah Arendt and Lionel Trilling literary though some of them may have been clearly reached a broader intellectual audience than the more directly political initiatives of The New Leader Despite the cosmopolitan ambiance of Mr Hooks political and intellectual preoccupations there is a quintessential flavor of New York City about his life and experiences Born in the Jewish slums of the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn he attended City College where he fell under the spell of Morris Cohen and went on to study under Dewey at Columbia before becoming at a surprisingly young age the chairman and for many years the leading figure of the philosophy department at New York University His recollections of the incredible stuffiness patriotic piety and antiSemitic bigotry of New York public schools and of university administrations against which he was a youthful rebel describe a world that has thankfully vanished Mr Hook became of course a leading adherent of pragmatism the one indigenously American philosophical doctrine but his battles for naturalism against theism in any form and his immersion in leftwing ideological politics remind us of just how European a city New York has been often more attuned to events in London Paris Berlin Moscow or Tel Aviv than to those in Washington let alone the rest of the country In recent years Mr Hook has had close ties with the neoconservatives If neoconservatism is the political culture of the old antiStalinist left preserved in aspic as Sidney Blumenthal has suggested Mr Hook is a much purer relic of this culture precisely because he denies that he is any kind of conservative when he describes himself as an unreconstructed believer in the welfare state and in a steeply progressive income tax a secular humanist and a firm supporter of freedom of choice with respect to abortion voluntary euthanasia and other domestic measures to which [ Ronald Reagan ] is opposed What Mr Hook shares with the neoconservatives is his passionate antiCommunism Indeed he might be described as the UrantiCommunist intellectual his antiCommunism is older more central to his world view and less alloyed with other independently held beliefs than just about anyone elses He first turned against Communism when he realized before most of the evidence was in that Stalin had betrayed and cruelly perverted the principles of socialism to which Mr Hook had been committed since his teens After 1935 the Soviet Union became primarily an issue for American foreign policy rather than the embodiment of an ideal to be emulated Mr Hooks major polemical fire was then directed at fellow travelers who equated America and Russia as worthy democratic allies against fascism With the coming of the cold war he led the intellectual assault on those who opposed American containment and nuclear deterrence of the Soviet Union or who faulted both superpowers as sharing equal responsibility for their hostile confrontation After 1956 such views were held for selfsufficient reasons and could no longer be attributed to the covert influence of American Communists who had been reduced to a mere political sect in the wake of Nikita Khrushchevs speech denouncing Stalin Mr Hook does not hesitate to call himself a Cold War liberal although this label was coined as a hostile epithet by I think my own former teacher C Wright Mills The constancy of Mr Hooks antiCommunism for over half a century results in a certain blurring of necessary distinctions Mr Hook tends to write as if he had always been an intrepid battler against a perennially popular and virtually unchanging foe Sometimes he is aroused to arms against those whose antiCommunism is merely less salient or monolithic than his own or against writers in smallcirculation journals who permit themselves to speculate freely about diverse political possibilities instead of always holding forth as if they were the Secretary of State at a press conference FOR example he spends six pages of his penultimate chapter criticizing an early 1960s Partisan Review symposium on the cold war claiming that of 15 noncommunist intellectuals who contributed Arthur Schlesinger Jr and he were the only ones who clearly indicated that the choice between being red or dead was a false one and the only ones who unambiguously opposed American unilateral disarmament Doubtless I was the least illustrious of the symposiasts and was printed last as usual for alphabetical reasons but I specifically quoted the better red than dead slogan in order to deny its relevance Hannah Arendt and Irving Howe with both of whom Mr Hook has crossed swords on occasion also rejected it Arendt writing of this preposterous alternative and Mr Howe declaring he had no patience or sympathy with those who saw the world in such starkly unrealistic terms Mr Hook also misconstrues several contributors as advocating unilateral disarmament by the United States when they were expressing no more than their hopes for mutual disarmament by both superpowers at a time before any of the major arms control treaties had been negotiated Mr Hook is much too ready to deploy a welltooled argument against a point of view that no one in the house has actually supported Many ideological currents that had their source in the early 1930s and were still flowing strongly well into the Reagan years now appear to be running out and drying up This is true of Mr Hooks fervent ideological antiCommunism as well as of more affirmative doctrines Not that our leaders will let alone should cease pledging their allegiance to deterrence and the policy of containment for which it stands one NATO indivisible and all the rest But 70 years after the Bolshevik Revolution 40 years after the beginning of the cold war and 34 years after the death of Stalin it is just not possible nor is it desirable in the absence of war to maintain the sense of impending apocalypse the high pitch of alarm and moral indignation to which Mr Hook and the neoconservatives constantly exhort us Inevitably we are increasingly inclined to regard the Soviet Union much as Czarist Russia was viewed before 1914  as a backward but powerful authoritarian state against which it is wise to maintain a stable and credible balance of power but no more than that Mr Hook reports that his work on this autobiography was interrupted more than once by nearly fatal illnesses We should be grateful that he has been able to complete it providing us with so full and vigorously written a record of an intense embattled but entirely honorable life in this painful tumultuous century

60's CHAPLAINS REFLECT ON STUDENTS TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/education/60-s-chaplains-reflect-on-students-today.html,ONE ASPECT of academic life has little to do with finals or grades professors or administrators It is the province of campus chaplains and involves as the Rev William Sloane Coffin describes it the education of the heart The role of the chaplain is to ask where does the heart go to school said Dr Coffin a Presbyterian chaplain at Yale University from 1958 to 1976 and to ask the question Now that weve got this education what do we do with it  The responsibility of chaplains to raise such questions has not changed since the 1960s when Dr Coffin and other religious figures were active in student demonstrations for civil rights and against the war in Vietnam Today the causes have changed and so has campus life Chaplains have had a frontrow seat for observing these changes In recent conversations three chaplains active on Ivy League campuses during the student activism of the 1960s reflected on students today From their perspective the students are more conservative and more openly religious They report a fairly dramatic increase in attendance at devotional services While Ivy League campuses are usually known for leading trends this may be one instance where they are followers Chaplains at lesserknown schools noted that similar changes have already taken place at their campuses The main change in my time here has been in the attitude toward religion itself said Rabbi BenZion Gold a Conservative rabbi who has been at Harvards branch of the Hillel Foundation a national organization of Jewish campus groups since 1958 In the 50s and early 60s the attitude toward religion was unfriendly People regarded it as a leftover from the Dark Ages No selfrespecting intellectual viewed religion seriously Now it is quite the opposite he continued Most selfrespecting people are prepared to listen and to think many have become very devout Religion is not at the center but religious people are respected Secularism is no longer the preferred position When Rabbi Gold first went to Harvard almost 30 years ago about 80 people attended the Friday night services Now close to 300 come for three services Orthodox Conservative and Reform At Brown University the Rev Howard V OShea the Roman Catholic chaplain has noted the same trend among Catholic students All the evidence indicates that they go to mass more than their parents he said Im always having to order more altar breads for communion YET THIS increased attendance doesnt necessarily mean that students are more devout the chaplains said Father OShea a Franciscan priest who characterizes himself as a liberal on church issues says he believes that Catholic students widely disregard the recent statement of Pope John Paul II condemning such matters as homosexuality and abortion Im taking the temperature here all the time about the activities of the Holy See Father OShea said My students are respectful of the Vatican but not particularly interested Theyd yawn if Id attempt to convey the contemporary rigid approach he said adding that a yawn would be an appropriate response They realize it is OK to take what is relevant from the church and to reject the rest Father OShea who has been at Brown since 1963 is nostalgic for the 1960s campus life I miss it he said I really do I liked it when they were raising hell Unlike Father OShea Rabbi Gold looks back with caution I think those were tragic days The country was in deep trouble There were some beautiful moments in it some real altruism real excitement about serious causes but like all upheavals it had its problems It is not something you wish to institutionalize or prolong not something one relishes Rabbi Gold found the 1960s a difficult time for him on campus While in sympathy with student causes he was not always comfortable with the tactics It was a time he said when a religious leader had to resist being popular Yes I was there when the students staged a sitin at University Hall Rabbi Gold recalled I came there to be with them but I didnt lead them into it Dr Coffin now senior minister at Riverside Church in New York City had no reservations about leading students into demonstrations In one widely publicized episode in 1967 he and several other activists including Dr Benjamin Spock led an antiVietnam War protest in Boston at which 944 draft cards were collected from young men and later presented to the Justice Department Dr Coffin was arrested along with others for counseling to evade the draft though the charges were later dropped By adding the moral dimension Dr Coffin says university chaplains helped bring together students and faculty members I used to tell the economics professors to ask their freshmen to consider this question To whom does the earth belong  When professors discussed moral issues the results represented the best in what the academic world can offer Dr Coffin argued In the 60s he said the teachins were so moving To have the expert on Shakespeare the expert on Southeast Asia and the scientist all talking about Vietnam A sense of community was built around those teachins Chaplains traditionally outside the academic hierarchy also helped advise students in choosing careers Dr Coffin used to tell students bound for big law firms or big business to spend a year with migrant workers or in the Peace Corps Today he sometimes wonders what happened to the enthusiasm of that era and to the people he influenced Many of them he believes put their ideals in the closet as they got caught up with issues of family and career an increasing preoccupation during the economic upheavals of the 1970s I know that their kids are going to go into the closets pull out the ideals dust them off and ask their fathers Daddy what are these  said Dr Coffin All three ministers agreed that the renewed interest today in religion is an outgrowth of the tumultuous 60s Rabbi Gold said that faith in American society what he calls civic religion was shattered during that decade Civic religion was called very much into question because of the war itself the civil rights movement and the counterculture movement he said Elements of society and government were laid bare because they countenanced and preserved prejudices The era also unleashed another phenomenon he said a new pride in diversity that celebrated different life styles and religions The idea took hold that it is all right to be who you are There are many ways to be an American  you can be black or white Protestant or Catholic Amish or Jew People began to say religion has an important role to play in life and in shaping values Father OShea said the pastoral letters of the nations Roman Catholic bishops on such issues as nuclear war and the effect of the economy on the poor had encouraged many Catholic students to find religion relevant to their lives Both letters particularly the 1983 letter calling for an end to the deployment of nuclear weapons have greatly affected Catholic students he said Once again Father OShea said the students took what they deemed relevant in Catholic teaching while respectfully rejecting Papal encyclicals they found out of date Another result of the openness of the 1960s Father OShea said is a student body more able to cope with personal problems including concerns about sexuality Students today are much less in need of counseling he observed Maybe high school counselors are getting better or maybe it is because of the more open discussion in our society Things that you once could not mention are all over the television screens I find it a very encouraging sign RABBI GOLD at Harvard also spends less time counseling today He says the nature of students concerns has changed Students often find the answers to their religious questions to be far more complex than they first thought I find myself spending more time on their theological concerns than their personal problems he said They are very hungry for ideas All of the three ministers expressed enthusiasm for the renewed interest in religion on the campus viewing it as positive as long as it was not taken to the extreme of intolerance They associated such intolerance with groups like the Christian fundamentalist movement which has made inroads into the campus in recent years My understanding of faith is that it makes possible intellectual uncertainty said Dr Coffin But a religion that gives all the answers because it does not permit the questions is antiuniversity and ultimately antireligious Rabbi Gold said the Harvard Hillel branch that he directs was an unusual model of religious tolerance among the major branches of Judaism I am very pleased that we contain in one small building three religious communities that do not compromise their traditions he said EACH FRIDAY night after services the Harvard Hillel serves about 100 Sabbath meals in its kosher kitchen During the winter when the days are short the Orthodox students meet early in the evening for prayer The Conservative and Reform who are less insistent on beginning the prayers at sundown have their services later I find that the Orthodox students sit and wait for the other services to finish so that they can all eat the Sabbath meal together Rabbi Gold said At a time when the three branches of Judaism have been split over several theological issues such as conversion and defining Jewish heritage the Jewish students at Harvard demonstrate an unusual spirit of unity All three ministers believe that being a campus chaplain is one of the best careers in religious life To be part of the academic life and not be subject to it is a very blissful experience said Father OShea If Rabbi Gold has one reservation it is that administrative duties take too much of his time He wishes he could do more teaching and reading It is more important that I be a rabbi an interpreter of the tradition to the best of my ability he said I miss the students said Dr Coffin I miss the intellectual proficiency and depth of scholarship I found among faculty friends On the other hand I find too many leading universities precious and arrogant so I am happy where I am The churches today are the forefront of the struggle for social change Dr Coffin contended The main protest against US involvement in Central America against the arms race and for the poor is not to be found in the academic world But he is hopeful that campus passions will once again be ignited People will get bored with being bored he said
LEGACY OF A MOTHER'S MURDER,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/magazine/legacy-of-a-mother-s-murder.html,THE ORDER OF THE New Jersey Superior Court on Sept 19 1985 was explicit Philip Andrew Taylor 15 months old would be in the custody of his deceased mothers sister and her husband from September 1 each year to June 30 of each following year From July 1 to Aug 31 of each year custody was awarded to the infants paternal grandparents Although Janice Miller a toughminded 44yearold New Jersey lawyer with fineboned features and short curly blond hair wasnt enthralled with some of the qualifying language in the order the bottom line was right there in black and white That of course had all happened before she got into the case  a case that not only involved a grisly homicide and a childs future but churned up dark undercurrents of ethnic and religious hostility of rural versus urban America For Ms Miller it all started June 10 1986 when she received a call from a woman who identified herself as Celeste White from Staten Island in New York City Speaking in an urgent panicky tone Mrs White said she had to see Ms Miller immediately She explained that she was the sister of Teresa Taylor whose husband had so brutally murdered her Ms Miller remembered that didnt she Ms Miller did but not in any detail All she recalled from local news reports was that Dr Kenneth Taylor a dentist who lived nearby in prosperous Manalapan Township had been convicted of bludgeoning his wife to death eight months earlier Mrs White explained the custody arrangements involving the couples son but said that subsequent psychological evaluations showed that the visitation rights accorded the paternal grandparents should be drastically modified Time was running out A custody hearing was scheduled for a week hence Ms Miller groaned inwardly She had a full caseload Hadnt Mrs White retained other lawyers in the past Yes Mrs White replied two of them at different times as a matter of fact But they werent forceful enough She needed someone who would really fight Well Janice Miller had heard that one before Then came more bad news After Ms Miller said that she didnt think she had time enough to prepare properly she added that her fee was 125 an hour and that she would require 1000 up front Celeste White hesitated She and her husband didnt have that much money she said They already were 2000 out of pocket for legal costs and owed 9000 more which they were paying off at 200 a week Please please Mrs White begged I dont know where to turn All I know is that I want a woman representing us That evening over dinner in the spacious house on the Jersey Shore that combines their living and professional quarters Ms Miller told her husband and law partner Frank Gaudio about the call What did you decide Gaudio asked I told her Id at least see her Janice said There was just something in her voice I couldnt ignore Celeste and Jeff White arrived at Ms Millers office late in the afternoon of June 13 A small woman with chestnut hair framing strikingly luminous gray eyes Celeste spoke with the same rapid intensity as before Her husband a muscular squarefaced man was as composed as his wife was kinetic He worked as a marine oiler on the ferry between Staten Island and Manhattan earning 25000 a year Interspersed with tears Celeste took three hours to tell the story an account Ms Miller later corroborated through court and lawenforcement records Celeste and her sister Teresa two years older were the daughters of Louise and Albert Benigno Their father taught drafting at a vocational high school in Brooklyn The daughters had been exceptionally close sharing the same room through their teens in the familys modest Staten Island home They had a younger brother Philip upon whom they doted Her sister Celeste said was the greeneyed family beauty smart and ambitious anxious to move up in life Where Celeste for example had married Jeff shortly after finishing high school Teresa had gone to Brooklyn College for two years to get a license as a dental hygienist In 1981 in her first job in a Brooklyn clinic she met and subsequently fell in love with Dr Kenneth Z Taylor a dentist who had been at the clinic for about a year following his discharge as a Navy lieutenant Taylor was from Marion Ind 65 miles north of Indianapolis A solid sixfooter with a slightly receding hairline and an air of quiet confidence he was 10 years older than Teresa and in the throes of a divorce The divorce business bothered Teresas mother Also in the voluble Sicilian warmth of the Benigno family Taylors cool reserve seemed out of place and he made little effort to hide a general disdain for New York and New Yorkers But these were hardly major objections to the relationship Hes the most intelligent man Ive ever met Teresa confided to Celeste And he was a doctor On the positive side Taylor announced that he was going to practice at two offices in Staten Island He even said he would hire Philip Benigno as his office manager Although Teresa was raised as a Roman Catholic Ken insisted on a Protestant ceremony They were married in Staten Island on July 10 1983 She was 23 The only odd note was that Taylors younger brother who was to have been his best man didnt come Philip Benigno filled in Two of Taylors colleagues from the dental clinic attended as did his parents Jean and Everett both active members of Marions First Baptist Church and his grandmother To the other wedding guests Jean Taylor seemed uncomfortably uptight while her husband an RCA industrial engineer was more gregarious The happy couple immediately flew off for a honeymoon in Acapulco A week afterward Louise and Albert Benigno drove to Kennedy airport to greet them Neither got off the plane An airline representative said their return tickets had not been validated Stunned the Benignos drove home When Albert Benigno got through to the Las Brisas Hotel he was told that Dr and Mrs Taylor had checked out the previous Thursday that there had been trouble and that Mrs Taylor was hospitalized It wasnt until Monday morning that Albert was able to reach an official at the American Consulate and hours more before he learned that his daughter had been savagely beaten and that her husband was being held by Mexican police as her assailant Celeste and her father flew to Acapulco on Tuesday July 19 At the hospital she was barely able to stifle a scream when she saw her sister The only way she could recognize Teresa was by her hair Her eyes were puffy slits One side of her face was completely bandaged covering wounds flecked with shards of glass The other side was a swollen purplish mass Another bandage covered a deep slash in her neck caused by the jagged edge of a broken bottle All her front teeth were broken Taylor was sitting by her bed holding her hand He explained that intruders had broken into their hotel room while they were asleep He had tried to fend them off was knocked out and came to to find his battered wife on the floor He had been arrested but that was simply a shakedown by corrupt Mexican police As soon as he directed them to 500 he had secreted in a suitcase he said he was freed Only much later did the Benignos learn that Taylor had been considered a prime suspect because among other things he had admitted to taking a shower to wash off the blood covering him before telephoning the front desk for help and that he was released after Teresa refused to press charges All she knew the heavily sedated Teresa whispered to Celeste was that she had gone to sleep in the hotel and woke up in the hospital On Wednesday July 20 they all flew home During the flight Celeste sat at Teresas feet constantly wiping her drooling mouth Celeste said later that Ken Taylor kept feeding her sister Valium and taking it himself She said he tried to offer some to her saying Come on You need it Weve all had a tough time Teresa was removed from the plane in a wheelchair and spent two weeks in Staten Island Hospital For another month she recuperated at the Benigno home Despite the suspicions the Benignos harbored Teresa insisted especially to Celeste Youre wrong Ken couldnt have done it He loves me As the scars on Teresas face began to fade so did the familys memory of the incident like a bad dream nobody wanted to recall Teresa proudly announced that her husband had bought a twostory house with a pool in Manalapan Township Then she revealed even grander news She was pregnant Nobody knew that Taylor had urged his wife to have an abortion There was more excitement when six months into Teresas pregnancy Celeste said that she too was going to have a baby and the two sisters reveled in their new bond The only jarring moment Celeste could remember occurred while they were shopping together one afternoon Teresa looked at her watch and said My God Ive got to get home and Celeste said Were having fun Just call Ken and tell him youll be late Teresa whitefaced said no and drove off At the time though it only left Celeste with guilt feelings about being inconsiderate of her own husband Philip Andrew Taylor blueeyed and blond was born June 11 1984 Teresa told her sister Celeste you dont know what love is like until you have a child Three months after the babys birth Taylor insisted that his wife go back to work His practice was not doing well he said and they had to economize During the day Teresa would leave little Philip in her mothers care On Sundays the custom was for everyone to gather at the Benigno house for a festive Italian meal But on Saturday Nov 11 Teresa called to say that she and Ken would instead be visiting a friend the next day Sometime late that same Saturday night or early Sunday morning Ken Taylor murdered his wife smashing in the back of her head at least nine times with a 20pound barbell Telephone toll records would show that between midnight and 548 AM Sunday 26 calls were made from Taylors home to pornographic message services in California and brothels in New York Although he did his best to remove any traces of what had happened forensic experts would discover evidence of a 55foot trail of blood in the house as Taylor dragged Teresas body to the garage and deposited her in the trunk of his car He then placed 5monthold Philip in the front seat and drove to the home of his parents in Indiana On Monday morning an astonished Louise Benigno learned from Taylor where he and Philip Andrew were He told her he had dropped Teresa off at Newark airport at her insistence because she had a bad drug habit and was going to a rehabilitation center to clean up her act He said Teresa wouldnt tell him where the center was With Teresas body still in the trunk of his car Taylor drove next to Pittsburgh to see his exwife on the occasion of their daughters fifth birthday Afterward in central Pennsylvania he dumped the body in a wildlife bird sanctuary On Wednesday he arrived at the Benigno home Over a sandwich he told Louise I love you Mom I love Teresa I dont understand why she was on drugs why she left us Taylor reported her missing to the police that day and accompanied Celeste and Jeff White to Newark airport where he went through the motions of showing a photogaph of Teresa to airport personnel Taylor drove back to his exwifes house in Pittsburgh Celeste and Jeff then went to the police themselves and voicing their worst fears reported the assault on Teresa in Mexico Late Thursday a hiker discovered Teresas body On Friday Albert Benigno and his son identified her Philip Benigno was barely able to stand up after he reached down to cradle Teresa His hand had gone right through the back of his sisters crushed skull Still sticking to his story Taylor voluntarily went to the police and allowed his house to be searched While his interrogation continued a bloody earring belonging to his wife was found in the garage Confronted with this Taylor suddenly said he would tell a disgraceful truth he had been hiding to protect the family name He said he had awakened Sunday morning and walked downstairs to find his wife performing fellatio on their infant son He tried to intervene but crazed by cocaine Teresa attacked him with a barbell He managed to grab it and gave it to her Then Taylor stopped talking He wanted a lawyer During Taylors trial for murder the Benignos learned that he had actually been married three times He had left his first wife in Indiana while she was pregnant and had never seen her since According to Paul F Chaiet First Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor the first wife said Taylor had used drugs during their marriage Visitors to the Taylor home testified that Taylor used cocaine and that Teresa had taken some on occasion A toxicologist however reported that while a minute trace of cocaine residue was found in her body it was nowhere near what would be required to cause the drugcrazed aggression Taylor had described Ken Taylor was found guilty of murder and on Oct 4 1985 was sentenced to serve a minimum of 30 years without parole But the agony of Philip Andrew Taylor his ultimate victim had just begun LAST JUNE 13 WHEN CELESTE White finished telling her story Janice Miller did not ask the question almost everyone else had asked how could Teresa have stayed with such a man Ms Miller didnt have to She already knew the answer For nine years she had been a battered wife herself Married at 16 before finishing high school shed had four children by the time she was 21 Once when her screams brought neighbors to the house she told them through the door Its all right Theres nothing wrong In 1967 after an especially bad beating in which she suffered a serious concussion her husband told the doctor that she had fallen down some stairs  she came to a chilling realization If he touched her one more time she was sure she would kill him So she fled Janice Miller was then 25 During the next 15 years while raising two sons and two daughters and supporting herself in assorted jobs including working as a waitress a house cleaner a newspaper distributor a legal secretary and a paralegal  she got a high school equivalency diploma put herself through Douglass College part of Rutgers University and finally obtained a law degree at Temple University in Philadelphia Critical financing came when she settled a sex discrimination suit against the law firm where she had been employed as a paralegal But there would remain a last testing of her character and determination In July 1982 two weeks before she was to take bar examinations for New Jersey and Pennsylvania her third child a boy was back in the hospital after having been gravely injured in a car accident In between sitting by his side she took the exams anyway  and passed them both With her other children leading productive lives life for Janice Miller dramatically changed when she married Frank S Gaudio a Temple law graduate several years her junior in 1984 Gaudio not speaking a word of English had arrived in America at the age of 6 with his parents immigrants from the province of Calabria in Italy Gaudios father was a concrete laborer and Frank like Janice had worked his way through school He was especially supportive of his wifes dedication to the plight of battered women and her lobbying for legislation on their behalf And now after the Whites had left her office Janice told her husband that she was going to take the case regardless of fees It was she said a classic instance of how violence in a family ends up affecting everyone The documents the Whites gave Ms Miller showed that immediately after his arrest Kenneth Taylors parents came to his Manalapan home with Philip Two weeks later with indications that the Taylbs intended to return with Philip to Indiana the Whites turned to the courts A Monmouth County judge ordered that the infant remain in New Jersey under a shared custody arrangement He would be with the Whites three days a week and with his grandparents the rest of time After Taylors conviction this order was modified to give the Whites an extra day and a courtappointed psychologist was directed to evaluate the situation as a means of moving toward a final custody resolution The psychologist reported that while the Whites and Taylors both appeared to be loving nurturing and supportive parental figures it was a crucial bonding period for Philip that the Whites were active energetic parents who can provide [ Philip ] with a very childoriented lifestyle and that it was in his best interests that he be placed in their custody A temporary legal guardian appointed by the state echoed this view noting that the Taylors would be in their 70s when Philip entered high school and that the Whites now had a daughter six months younger than Philip which established a fullfamily environment A court order was issued giving the Whites custody of Philip 10 months of the year and his grandparents in Indiana two months during the summer On a motion by the Taylors the order was amended to allow them an overnight visitation with Philip for three days during Thanksgiving and a week more at Christmas More than anything though what appalled Janice Miller was that Celeste White also had to accept a call once a week to Philip from her sisters killer and that once a month the Whites had to bring Philip to see his father at the Trenton State Prison in New Jersey Real trouble began when the Whites discovered that during the Thanksgiving visitation the grandparents had taken Philip on successive days to see his father Another psychologist retained by the Whites had strongly recommended that Philip not visit Mr Taylor in prison emphasizing that Taylor cannot be the primary caretaker within the next 30 years because of his imprisonment and that visitation would only confuse Philip and cause severe identity problems The Whites residing in Staten Island petitioned New York to take over the case thus successfully thwarting a Christmas visitation by the Taylors But a New York court ruled that under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act adhered to by all 50 states New Jersey had custodial authority Which is where Ms Miller came into the case and began efforts to have the Taylors visitation rights reduced Ms Miller at once saw problems Although there was nothing underhanded about the way New York had been petitioned she was certain that New Jersey Superior Court Judge Walter H Gehricke wasnt going to be amused Also the Whites had failed to pay 500 in counsel fees that had been awarded to the attorney hired by the Taylors to contest the New York petition and to post a 2000 bond in regard to Philips custody The fact that they couldnt afford it wasnt going to cut much ice Near the end of last July as the custodial hearing drew to a close Ms Miller figured she had Judge Gehricke leaning toward her clients Of crucial importance was the testimony of the original courtappointed psychologist who reiterated in even stronger terms that Philip shouldnt spend even one night away from the Whites Still Ms Miller felt that Judge Gehricke wasnt going to deny some visitation to Philips picturepostcard MiddleAmerica grandparents So she proposed a deal Philip could spend two weeks a year with them The Whites would be allowed to phone him every day and throughout the second week theyd have at least an hours visit with him each day Celeste White objected Shed seen Ken Taylor who had been brought in from prison for the hearing wink broadly at his parents What did that mean Ms Miller said she didnt know she only knew what she sensed the judge was thinking Furthermore she expected tough negotiations with the Taylors lawyer To her surprise he bought the deal without a quibble On Aug 1 with both parties and their attorneys present and in agreement Judge Gehricke read a final custody order based on Ms Millers proposed settlement That night Celeste placed Philip in the front seat of the camper the Taylors had arrived in from Indiana told him hed have a wonderful time with his grandparents and that shed see him very soon Relieved that it was all over Janice Miller turned to other cases On Aug 6 near midnight after trying to sleep she gave up in exasperation went down to her office and worked till morning I dont know whats wrong with me she told her husband at breakfast At 930 AM as spooky as it sounded even to her she found out Celeste White was calling in hysterics She had just spoken to Philips grandmother in Marion Ind to work out logistics for the courtordered visit she and Jeff would begin making the next day Jean Taylor had told her Dont bother Weve adopted Philip and youre never going to see him again Ms Miller stared at the phone in disbelief before she said Ill get back to you Then she tracked down the Grant County circuit judge in Marion Thomas R Hunt who had signed the adoption decree and told him about the New Jersey custody order Hunt seemed astounded As soon as she got him a copy of the order he said he would rescind the adoption She tore off to Judge Gehrickes chambers He couldnt believe the news either Late that afternoon Ms Miller met Celeste and Jeff White at Newark airport to fly to Indiana with the order But plane after plane was delayed because of bad weather Finally around 10 oclock they boarded one for Chicago The ride was nightmarish Celeste was bent over moaning Why did I ever let him go A whiteknuckled Jeff held her as the plane bucked through wind drafts it was his first flight ever They all reached Marion around noon on Friday Aug 8 At the courthouse Ms Miller was told that Hunt had gone fishing for the weekend and was unreachable She located the attorney for the county welfare department and explained the problem The attorney helped Ms Miller prepare an order placing Philip in temporary fosterhome care and got a second Marion judge to sign it Ms Miller and the Whites went with the welfare attorney a case worker and a deputy sheriff to the Taylor home to pick up Philip that evening It looked as if the deputy would have to break down the door before Everett Taylor opened it and said he was calling his lawyer The welfare attorney brought Philip out and handed him to the case worker Celeste standing to one side with Jeff and Ms Miller called to him Baby baby and Philip reaching toward her said Mommy The Taylors attorney Patrick N Ryan roared up tires squealing He ran after the case worker who locked the car doors rolled up the windows and sped off before he could wrest Philip from her At the welfare center Ms Miller was impressed with the family selected to care for Philip Still after he was taken away Celeste White collapsed sobbing And Jeff at last lost his composure Why cant you do something he yelled at Janice Miller This isnt Russia is it With the situation apparently on reasonable hold Ms Miller and the Whites flew home where the Whites got the van they had originally intended to use to pick up Philip and drove back to Marion to await invalidation of the adoption decree But Monday morning there were two more thunderbolts First the judge who had signed the order putting Philip temporarily in a foster home canceled it without comment which meant that Philip had to be returned to the Taylors Minutes later in the same courthouse Judge Hunt who had signed the adoption degree withdrew from the case effectively keeping Philip in Indiana The consensus of Marion lawyers who lunch daily at The Nobby Grill a block from the courthouse is that Hunt had stepped all over himself on this one and recused himself out of embarrassment Hunt himself has been quoted as saying he was blindsided by Patrick Ryan And indeed the adoption petition and subsequent decree were artfully crafted by Ryan who like the Taylors is a member of Marions First Baptist Church The petition filed in Indiana on Jan 17 1986  while the Taylors were going through the charade of a shared custody fight in New Jersey  simply said that Philips mother was deceased without providing any explanation of the circumstances that the father had given his consent with no mention of his current residence  namely a state penitentiary  which would have raised some questions that the child had no property although in fact a 130000 trust fund had been established for him in New Jersey with Teresas life insurance and the proceeds from the sale of the Manalapan house and that Philip had lived with his grandparents from November 1984 to September 1985 without any indication that custody was shared with the Whites or that this had taken place in New Jersey not Indiana The actual decree dated last Aug 7 acknowledged that a custody proceeding was pending in New Jersey without mentioning that it had already been ruled on and accepted by all parties That adoption slipped right by Judge Hunt like a hot knife going through butter a Marion lawyer told me He probably didnt even read it before he signed it Now Philip Andrew Taylor as a person began to disappear inexorably in a legal thicket of motions briefs and appeals Meanwhile Kenneth Taylor unsuccessfully tried to escape from prison He was subsequently transferred to a Virginia correctional institution And an enraged Paul Chaiet who had prosecuted Taylor sought a criminal extradition warrant for Jean and Everett Taylor for defying the New Jersey custody order New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean signed the warrant as did Indiana Governor Robert D Orr With November elections coming up a hearing on the extradition was held by the last of Marions three county judges In a courtroom packed with members of the First Baptist Church he reserved decision But it quickly became academic The next day Governor Orr withdrew the warrant for further investigation Finally on Dec 18 a judge from another county R Alan Brubaker held a hearing on the validity of the adoption A significant exchange took place between Everett Taylor and Richard A Green a hardnosed local lawyer whom Janice Miller had brought into the case Q When you filed the Indiana adoption they [ Celeste and Jeff White ] didnt receive notice did they A No Marion is in deepseated Biblebelt country The marquee in front of a supermarket doesnt announce a sale say for pork chops it says Love Jesus On March 9 after interviewing the Whites in Staten Island I went to Marion to see the Taylors I knew Jean Taylor was saying that Indiana was a much better place for Philip than New Yorks fast lane I also had discovered that she fully subscribed to her sons version of the murder and I wanted to ask if she were passing this on to her grandson But neither Taylor would receive me Their attorney Patrick Ryan claimed not to know the answer to my question In any event he said it was inconsequential The only thing that counted was the adoption which was final Everything else including the New Jersey custody order was technicalities The courtappointed New Jersey psychologist he said was a real screwball As for the Taylors age if something happened to them their son Tom could take over or their daughter Tom I would learn was single in his early 30s gave the Taylor home as his legal residence and listed his occupation as athletic referee Ryan didnt have the daughters name handy He said he believed she lived in New Orleans and was married to some kind of military man I called the Indiana Attorney Generals office to find out how the investigation on the extradition warrant was coming and a spokesman admitted that there hadnt been an investigation that they were waiting on a decision about Philips adoption While he agreed that legally there was no connection between the warrant and the adoption he said Its really all very complicated if you know what I mean At this writing Judge Brubaker has yet to render a ruling Janice Miller is convinced that sooner or later she will win the case And while she knows that the Whites will never be able to pay her fees she is maintaining exact billing charges She has a lot of civil suits in mind But all of this is secondary to the wellbeing present and future of Philip Andrew Taylor now two months short of his third birthday and in psychological jargon a very highrisk child As Janice Miller says Whats actually on trial here is the system

U.S. JUDGE OVERTURNS LAW ON FAMILY LIFE PROGRAM,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/16/us/us-judge-overturns-law-on-family-life-program.html,A Federal district judge ruled today that key provisions of a 1981 law designed to discourage adolescent sexual activity were unconstitutional because they violated the requirement for separation of church and state Under the law the Reagan Administration has given more than 92 million to hospitals universities social service agencies and religious organizations especially Roman Catholic charities Some of the money has been used for the teaching of family life and sex education classes at churches and parochial schools The law requires those to whom a grant is made to involve religious and charitable organizations in efforts to promote selfdiscipline and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital sexual relations including adolescent pregnancy The judge Charles R Richey said in a 53page decision that the law has a valid secular purpose But he added that the law was unconstitutional for two reasons Its primary effect is to advance religion and it fosters an excessive entanglement between Government and religion Education Linked to Religion Under the law Judge Richey said Federal funds have been used by pervasively sectarian institutions for education and counseling that amounts to the teaching of religion The judge said Federal money was used to finance sex education projects directed by members of religious orders as part of religious curriculums in classrooms adorned with religious symbols One grantee ran a program explicitly designed to communicate the Catholic and Mormon approaches to sex education he said In addition Judge Richey said the law creates political divisions along religious lines a development that the First Amendment to the Constitution was intended to prevent The First Amendment prohibits Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof The decision was noteworthy because the family life program has generated intense debate and because relatively few Federal statutes have been struck down as violations of the First Amendment requirement for separation of church and state Excessive Entanglement Seen Methodist clergy and the American Jewish Congress represented by the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the 1981 law on the ground that it promoted excessive entanglement between government and religion Judge Richey issued an injunction that prohibits the Government from distributing any more money to religious organizations under the law He declared that the law known as the Adolescent Family Life Act was unconstitutional on its face and as applied because religious organizations were involved in carrying out the programs and purposes of the law But the judge agreed that adolescent pregnancy was a major problem and suggested that parts of the law authorizing Federal grants to secular organizations might be upheld He ordered attorneys for the Government and for the plaintiffs to submit legal briefs on this question within 30 business days Judge Richey said the law tended to advance certain religions because it provided money for teaching and counseling of adolescents by religious organizations on matters related to religious doctrine including premarital sex and abortion Threat to Religious Freedom To prevent grantees from promoting religious values he said the Government would have to monitor their activities so closely that it would inevitably become entangled in the work of religious organizations Such entanglement he added violates the Constitution and threatens freedom of religion The plaintiffs said the purpose of the law was to prevent teenage sexual activity and pregnancy through the teaching of chastity The chief supporters of the law were conservative Republicans who wanted to reduce the number of adolescent pregnancies and encourage adoption as an alternative to abortion Janet Benshoof an ACLU lawyer called the decision a victory for taxpayers and the Constitution The ruling she added cuts a hole into a major program of ideological rightwing and religious groups that want to impose their own religious views with public money

RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/17/us/dole-confident-he-can-defeat-bush-in-gop-race.html,Nearing the end of a weeklong drive in his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination Bob Dole expressed confidence today that he would defeat Vice President Bush the favorite in the opinion polls Plentiful crowds and press attention in Iowa and the South and a warm reception at stops in Illinois have buoyed Mr Dole the Senate Republican leader despite Mr Bushs substantial lead in the polls The race is wide open and I have a good shot at it Senator Dole told reporters after addressing a breakfast crowd of more than 600 people at the OHare Westin Hotel here A lot of people are still looking Its a healthy race We have five or six people in it Right now its Bush and Dole Privately Mr Dole and his staff are even more optimistic about the Vice Presidents vulnerability partly because of the Iran arms scandal and partly because they see Mr Bushs campaign a least at the moment as relatively lowkeyed and the victim of some blunders Criticism of Dole Disavowed Last week for example in Iowa Mr Bushs campaign released a memorandum that criticized Senator Doles work on a 1985 farm bill The document said the bill largely ignored Iowas interests Over the weekend Mr Bush disavowed the criticism a move that generated considerable publicity in Iowa Even Mr Doles aides concede however that the 63yearold fourterm Senator from Kansas has major problems in seeking to defeat the Vice President Outside of his national headquarters in Washington and his state campaign office in Iowa Mr Doles organization in key states remains threadbare especially compared with Mr Bushs The Vice President with some success has sought to gather the support of Republican leaders across the country By contrast Mr Doles staff even at the national level seems skimpy and riven with jurisdictional disputes Nonetheless with the Senate in recess for Easter Mr Dole this week undertook the most arduous effort of his campaign and he was delighted with the results He made stops in Louisiana Georgia Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Iowa Oklahoma Missouri and Illinois Conservative on Foreign Policy Senator Doles foreign policy views expressed over the last few days are probably as conservative as President Reagans He supports the Presidents proposal for a system to shoot down attacking missiles strongly endorses sending arms to the Nicaraguan rebels and expresses only modest enthusiasm for an arms control accord with the Soviet Union On domestic issues his views seem far less predictable While he adheres to a conservative view opposing abortion in other social areas his votes sometimes mirror those of one of his friends in the Senate Edward M Kennedy For example Mr Dole criticized the Reagan Administration as not doing enough in dealing with AIDS He has also supported measures on voting rights food stamps and school lunch programs aid to the disabled and Medicare Moreover he told audiences in recent days that the deficit was the nations No 1 problem and that the Administration as well shared the blame with Congress Asked today at a news conference here about the differences between himself and the Vice President Mr Dole replied Leadership Experience Everyday experience Handson experience Im on the firing line almost every day in the United States Congress Im Republican leader majority leader and now minority leader Ive dealt with problems that probably affect everyone whether its voting rights or food stamps or school lunch or Medicare budget policy tax policy foreign policy I know how government works My resume may not be quite as long Mr Dole continued but Ive been making decisions and Bush hasnt really been making decisions since he left Congress in 1970 He may have made decisions in other areas whether its Republican national chairman or ambassador somewhere the Senator said of Mr Bush but most of that policy was set by the State Department the Administration I think when you get down to the nittygritty the differences between the candidates Ive got to believe my strength is continuous experience day to day Its current Announcement in September Mr Dole in an interview on the way to Chicago said he would probably make his formal Presidential announcement in September The next few months will be spent seeking support and money for his campaign with some traditional Democratic donors in New York and elsewhere expressing interest in his candidacy We can rush this too much Mr Dole said but in this swing I saw more interest in Presidential politics than say two or three months ago Its moving Somebodys going to be President People are saying Im going to show up and take a look at this guy he might be it

curious and questioning Arthur Ochs Sulzberger publisher of The Times said yesterday As a person and as a superb journalist she will be missed and mourned Expanded Coverage As editor of womens and family style news from 1965 to 1974 Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion society decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received Under her direction reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on womens news pages As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the OpEd page from 1974 to 1982 she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social economic and political issues of the day In that post she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960s chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful that Miss Curtis became one of the nations bestknown

patterns until beads of perspiration materialize on their aristocratic brows The Telling Moment At a cocktail party held by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers in 1970 when a Panther field marshal stridently outlined his tenets before a small group that included Mr Bernstein principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic Miss Curtis caught the telling moment  If business wont give us full employment then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people  I dig absolutely Mr Bernstein said Tom Wolfe who wrote about the same party in his book Radical Chic and MauMauing the Flak Catchers said of the ensuing flap It wasnt anything she wrote that infuriated them It was that she put down exactly what they said Thats always what seems cruelest of all to hold up a mirror to people that way In addition to her society and family style reporting Miss Curtis over the years pursued a variety of stories with datelines from around the world Deep Interest in Politics Her deepest interest dating from her college days was in American politics and culture She covered a number of national political conventions including the violencewracked Democratic National

Candidates are Striving to Establish THE Image,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/weekinreview/candidates-are-striving-to-establish-the-image.html,THIS is the period known as the invisible primary the stage of the Presidential campaign when candidates run almost no television commercials and receive no votes It is the time for battling for staff struggling for campaign money and skirmishing for the hearts and hands of the party activists who do the unheralded work of democracy But for each candidate declared and undeclared one of the most important tasks of the invisible primary is to set himself apart from his adversaries What issues should he emphasize What images does he want voters to carry into the voting booths when the real primaries start On the Republican side this process of differentiation is farther along partly because their field is less clogged than the Democrats For Representative Jack Kemps underdog campaign issues are destiny John Buckley Mr Kemps press secretary said that when Mr Kemp announced his candidacy earlier this month the national networks were able to bullet his position on issues in quick summary terms low taxes early deployment of an antimissile system in space a freeenterprise war on poverty an end to abortion All these stands have appeal with the Republican right to whom Mr Kemp hopes to appear as a truer believer in the conservative faith than the two who lead in the polls Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole Mr Kemps opponents argue that this strategy is an indication that he has not yet consolidated support among the ardent conservatives who should be his natural constituency His need to keep appealing to them they say will make it harder for him to achieve his other goal to be the candidate of the Republican new generation many of whom are liberal on social issues If Mr Kemps strategy is pretty well laid down Mr Dole seems to be relying mainly on instinct  and the free television time that comes with his job as Senate minority leader Bob Ellsworth the head of the Dole campaign said that the cover of the campaigns one leaflet tells the story It says Bob Dole President Thats it You can tell were not that far along yet Mr Ellsworth said For the moment Bob Dole President seems to be enough In a New York TimesCBS News Poll this month Mr Dole was rated favorably by 31 percent of Republicans and unfavorably by only 6 percent His ratings among Democrats and Independents are also high and Mr Ellsworth said this fact will be a major weapon in the Dole armory next year Mr Dole will be cast as the only Republican who can hold the Reagan coalition and the White House for his party Mr Bushs task is ticklish What hes basically got to do is start outlining his own position on things and coming out from being the No 2 guy said Lee Atwater the Bush campaign director and at the same time staying loyal to the President Mr Atwater thinks Mr Bushs task is not as hard as it seems Indeed Mr Bushs supporters argue that he is the most underrated of the candidates For one thing Mr Bush may be unpopular these days among Democrats but Republicans who after all will choose their partys nominee  like him quite a lot The TimesCBS News Poll of 1045 registered voters April 58 found that 28 percent of all Americans had a favorable opinion of Mr Bush 31 percent an unfavorable view But among Republicans it was favorable 45 percent unfavorable 16 percent Not a bad place to start Mr Bushs image as a strong loyalist is a key to his strength in the party Republican voters vote by and large for the authority figure in a primary said a Bush strategist The invisible primary between Bush and Dole is over who will be the candidate of the Establishment the party regulars A Democratic strategist added Bush has this image as a preppy countryclub guy But thats what a lot of Republicans are or aspire to be Among the darker horses argued Eddie Mahe a Republican consultant Pierre S du Pont 4th has been especially adept at using the invisible primary The former Delaware Governor has staked out highly controversial positions  ending farm subsidies making Social Security partly voluntary imposing mandatory drug tests in high schools  which have drawn him attentive audiences Hes talking about things that people can get interested in said Mr Mahe The Rev Pat Robertson has raised about 6 million and spent about 5 million in putting together a grassroots organization that could surprise other Republicans next year As for Mr Robertsons image it is long established through years of televised evangelism  though the Yale Law School graduate is trying to show that he is more than a preacher Former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr is trying to present his aggressive leadership style which some in the past called a flaw as a postIran virtue In the crowded Democratic contest positioning is extremely complex Paul Maslin a Democratic poll taker said that to challenge Gary Hart the leader in the polls who announced his candidacy last week each candidate needs to figure out two things how to distinguish himself from the others and how to distinguish himself from Mr Hart In 1984 Mr Hart was an astute player in the invisible primary understanding early that he should focus on the partys new generation Having done so he predicted before the primaries that he would be the serious challenger to Walter F Mondale Few believed him but he was right Still Mr Hart is also the candidate most skeptical about the rewards of the invisible primary On the night of the Iowa caucuses he said of that crucial first test next February almost everything said now could be proved wrong
SETON HALL PLANNING A MEDICAL SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/nyregion/seton-hall-planning-a-medical-school.html,LEAD AT THE urging of the states Catholic hospitals Seton Hall University in South Orange has established a graduate medical school that will train doctors in nine specialties and offer advanced degrees in molecular biology AT THE urging of the states Catholic hospitals Seton Hall University in South Orange has established a graduate medical school that will train doctors in nine specialties and offer advanced degrees in molecular biology The first students could be enrolled by the fall officials said Seton Hall New Jerseys only Catholic university will operate its new School of Graduate Medical Education in conjunction with three northern New Jersey Catholic teaching hospitals and the Roche Institute for Molecular Biology part of the research arm of HoffmannLa Roche the Nutleybased pharmaceutical company The affiliated hospitals are St Michaels Medical Center in Newark St Josephs Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson and St Elizabeth Hospital in Elizabeth Graduate medical education covers the three to five years of training during which doctors become internists pediatricians radiologists psychiatrists or one of the 25 or so other specialties Graduate medical students are called residents  the term internship which used to apply to the first graduate year is rarely used now  and fellows if they pursue subspecialties such as thoracic surgery or pediatric oncology Together the three new Seton Hall affiliates now train about 350 residents and fellows in about 18 programs Some of those have ties to the stateowned University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey UMDNJ some are linked with outofstate medical schools and some are described as freestanding The future of the hospitals affiliation with other medical schools remained unclear last week although officials said that they planned to maintain at least some of their existing relationships while developing the new Seton Hall programs Msgr John J Petillo chancellor of Seton Hall said that the new program would strengthen the existing residencies by coordinating training efforts at the three hospitals and adding an academic underpinning This gives us a chance to pool the resources of the hospitals to enrich the opportunities both for the residents and the medical centers he said Msgr Petillo predicted that the new arrangement would help the three hospitals attract a better pool of quality doctors Under the new plan he said a doctor enrolled in a residency program also could pursue say a masters degree in public administration or take additional courses toward a basic science degree Through the Roche Institute the new school will offer a doctorate degree in molecular biology to graduate fellows who have an MD degree and have finished two years of residency This expands our ability to obtain highly qualified graduate students and is an excellent opportunity for clinically trained people to get advanced education in molecular biology said Dr Herbert Weissbach director of the institute Seton Hall ran New Jerseys first undergraduate medical school from 1956 to 1964 at which time it was sold to the state and became the New Jersey Medical School now a division of the UMDNJ Planning for the latest Seton Hall medical school began a year ago when representatives from 14 Catholic hospitals in the state approached Msgr Petillo about starting a Catholic medical school An outside consultant concluded that Seton Hall lacked the resources for an undergraduate medical school but could mount a graduate program By some accounts Seton Hall is returning to medical education to counter the growing influence of the UMDNJ which comprises the New Jersey Medical School and the New Jersey Dental School in Newark Robert Wood Johnson Medical School formerly Rutgers Medical School in Piscataway and the School of Osteopathic Medicine in Camden The UMDNJ offers both undergraduate and graduate medical training as well as programs in the basic sciences and the allied health professions The university has begun a wellpublicized campaign to improve its national rank and to establish its four coreteaching hospitals as the states major referral centers for sophisticated medical care To bolster these efforts the university has sought priority consideration for its hospitals from state health planners who decide which institutions get newly developed medical devices and hightechnology services Doctors and administrators from Catholic hospitals are concerned about these efforts as well as the recommendations in a recent report on improving residency programs in the state The report issued by the Advisory Graduate Medical Education Council of New Jersey proposed among other things that all hospital residency programs have strong ties to medical schools and that the total residency slots be cut by an unspecified number Msgr Petillo noted that Dr Stanley S Bergen Jr president of the UMDNJ was chairman of the advisory council and had appointed the two task forces that contributed to the report Catholic hospitals were not represented on either task force Msgr Petillo said Dr Bergen responded that his appointments were based on recommendations by the New Jersey Association of Directors of Hospital Medical Education and that he could not be held responsible for the associations choices Officials from the three Seton Hall affiliates believe that the new medical school setup will improve and preserve their residency programs We do see that the UMDNJ is moving to develop itself and its core hospitals to be the prestigious medical institutions in the state said Sister Elizabeth Ann Maloney executive director of St Elizabeth Hospital Catholic hospitals participate actively in training residents and we do not want to lose our place Dr Leon Smith chairman of the department of medicine at St Michaels Medical Center added that the new alliance would give Catholic institutions a voice One hospital alone cannot face up to the political changes in New Jersey said Dr Smith who also is a full professor at the New Jersey Medical School Monsignor Petillo is a tireless worker who will be a strong spokesman for Catholic medical education in the state Asked to comment on the new Seton Hall program Dr Bergen said that except for a news release he had no information on it However he charged that the three hospitals joining Seton Hall had not fulfilled their contractual obligations to inform the New Jersey Medical School of their new teaching arrangements Dr Bergen maintained that the UMDNJ could meet the needs of Catholic hospitals asserting that a pluralistic medical school in a pluralistic society could accommodate various religions and sects Although Dr Bergen said that the New Jersey Medical School had had longrunning disputes over certain residency programs at both St Michaels and St Josephs he pointed out that St Peters Medical Center in New Brunswick had a positive relationship with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and had not chosen to join Seton Hall at this time I do recognize that the critical issues of family planning contraception and abortion are very difficult to deal with in a public hospital and a public teaching setting Dr Bergen said But even there I believe that differences can be accommodated if both sides are willing to be reasonable A public hospital has to respond to the general publics and societys needs and provide those services But we cant protect or separate the Catholic presence from those activities According to T Edward Hollander the states Chancellor of Higher Education Seton Hall is exempt from state regulation However Dr Hollander said that Seton Hall officials had reviewed their medical school plans with him If we were to evaluate Seton Hall Dr Hollander said we would want to be assured that it has the professional and intellectual capacity in this discipline to evaluate the residency programs and provide support to assure that they meet the highest standards of practice He added that Seton Hall could contribute to medical education if it eliminated weak programs and focused its resources on strong ones and if the surviving residencies then got high ratings from accrediting agencies Msgr Petillo stressed last week that Seton Hall was not competing with the UMDNJ We believe we are presenting an alternative to doctors he said in a telephone interview We will never claim to be as strong in research as the UMDNJ will be and should be Our emphasis will be on medical education There is a need for a Catholic approach to teaching doctors about new hightechnology techniques and biomedical issues
SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Reversing Field,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/20/sports/sports-world-specials-reversing-field.html,Three years after the Supreme Court struck down the legal underpinnings of gains that female collegians had made under Title IX womens athletic organizations foresee a brighter day for themselves this summer Thats when Congress seems likely to pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act which among other things would reverse the Courts Grove City decision In that case involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania the Court held that Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments designed to bar Federal aid to schools that discriminated against women applied only to specific Federally funded programs or departments and not to institutions as a whole Since athletic programs rarely receive Federal dollars the effect was to remove the constraints that had forced colleges to begin putting male and female sports on an equal footing The prospects for the restoration bill which would make clear that Title IX applies to a school in its entirety lead Marcia Greenberger to say Im very encouraged very optimistic Greenberger is the managing attorney of the National Womens Law Center one of a number of groups that have been lobbying hard for the legislation Her cheerfulness stems from the outlook in the Senate whose new Democratic majority should overcome the opposition of a Republican leadership that blocked the bill in the earlier GOPcontrolled Senate where the issue later became entangled in Federal policy on abortion Passage in the House which in 1984 approved a similar measure by a vote of 375 to 32 is considered assured While the bill would no more than restore the law to its previous state it could have an even larger impact for women than did their earlier gains Thats because the athletic revolution wrought by Title IX had barely begun when the Supreme Court halted it According to Katherine Reith of the Womens Sports Foundation womens programs which had accounted for only 2 percent of collegiate athletic budgets before Title IX rose to 16 percent before Grove City  a dramatic increase she and others concede but hardly enough to reflect true equality
MOYNIHAN WORKING ON IMAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/20/nyregion/moynihan-working-on-image.html,After seven days of talking and listening to hundreds of constituents in 15 towns across western New York State Daniel Patrick Moynihan might have shown a trace of flagging energy or interest But here was the New York Democrat who just turned 60 years old and is beginning his second decade in the United States Senate  front and center in a university auditorium in Syracuse effervescent with enthusiasm and conviction His large hands balanced imaginary weights and mimed graphs projecting alarming trends He shrugged his shoulders in bewilderment his jowls jiggled in earnestness and his voice alternately rising and falling seemed to combine the tones of both a peevish professor and a skilled orator His words came in salvos Mr Moynihan was spending Congress Easter recess hobnobbing with voters across a largely rural landscape that can seem remote from New York City and Washington Battling an Image Mr Moynihan whose second term in the Senate ends in January 1989 has not officially announced his intention to run for a third term But he did acknowledge that I think I probably will As for the Presidency Mr Moynihan said he had no current interest in the job Would you accept a draft asked a voter at the Syracuse forum Yes a Genesee 12horse he replied That evoked a belly laugh followed by applause for Mr Moynihans recognition of the locally popular beer Not just incidentally the punch line also underscored what seemed the primary purpose of this trip to dispel the widespread belief that Mr Moynihan is more a statesman than a man of the state and more adept at quoting Bacon than bringing it home On his swing through western New York local newspapers referred to that reputation In Rochester the TimesUnion reported pointedly that the Senator was holding his first ever town meeting in that city In Elmira the StarGazette complained that it took Moynihan six years to return Senator Alfonse M DAmato the paper noted in a separate story has visited 10 times Yet in each small city and hamlet along his 693mile trek Mr Moynihan charmed his listeners with his encyclopedic knowledge of local issues and history Im from Waterloo said a questioner at a forum in Seneca Falls City Hall Birthplace of Memorial Day Mr Moynihan interjected Thats right thats right the man responded already won over Eventually the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle acknowledged that the scholarsenator had demonstrated that he was comfortable with the nittygritty of grass roots constituent work The StarGazette informed its readers that Mr Moynihan spoke fluently and knowledgeably about issues concerning Elmira and the country Mr Moynihans aides argue that such conclusions represent appearance belatedly catching up with reality They produced sheafs of supporting documentation of Mr Moynihans important role on issues of vital interest to New York residents including the highway bill welfare reform and the Clean Water Act Constituent Feedback The town meetings and editorial board briefings were also an opportunity for Mr Moynihan to hear from his constituents The Irancontra scandal Washingtons current preoccupation was rarely mentioned Instead questions touched upon subjects ranging from the threat of nuclear proliferation to the condition of New Yorks bridges to local Indian land claims and the reluctance of Medicaid to pay for one womans dentures In his tweeds bow ties and suspenders a pair of tortoise shell halfglasses perched on the tip of his nose Mr Moynihan conveyed an impression of authority even before he spoke He asked questioners to state their names then addressed them with neighborly familiarity often concluding a statement by inquiring Would you agree He displayed his wellknown affection for digression  an upstate dairy farmer seeking increased price supports learned far more than she ever cared to about the Grand Duke of Liechtenstein  and he was not entirely averse to using historical meanderings to avoid a direct answer Many Opponents That was not always the case however In Syracuse a union member won applause for the Senator by crediting him with bringing the citys laid off workers more than 1 million for job retraining But when he added that he was counting on Mr Moynihan to push for a bill mandating bilateral balanced trade the Senator said that he opposed trade protectionism The rebuke was quietly accepted Mr Moynihan has spent many years developing the skill of retaining the good will of those who oppose his views There are numerous opponents of his positions Antiabortion groups are not satisfied with his stand He has said he abhors abortion but does not seek to outlaw it Leftwingers object to his tonguelashings of third world representatives while he served as ambassador to the United Nations in the mid70s and to his role as domestic policy advisor to President Nixon before taking the UN post Unabashed Liberal Rightwingers mistrust him because he defends Government as an institution that cures rather than solely causes social ills In an era dominated by neoconservatives and pragmatists Mr Moynihan continues to call himself a liberal Ive never used anything else the Senator said We shouldnt let people take that word away from us After his sessions with voters last week many people said they were suprised by how tall he was 6 foot 4 inches how trim he was how funny he was how smart he was and how well he knew his state Between whistle stops Mr Moynihan viewed the countryside from the front passenger seat of a rental car accompanied by a few young aides Maps sprawled across his lap while nearly every place name aging edifice river crossing and Civil War memorial sparked a discourse on the social and political movements that once flourished in this corner of the country Look at those gabled roofs he exclaimed in Seneca Falls commanding his aide to

Global Family Planning Program Advocated,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/20/world/global-family-planning-program-advocated.html,A comprehensive global family planning strategy is needed to keep accelerating world population growth from outpacing available resources according to a report made public today by the Population Institute The report cites projections that the worlds population may double to 10 billion in as little as 41 years but says it could stabilize around 74 billion if population control measures are quickly and conscientiously initiated The report A Blueprint for World Population Stabilization recommends a worldwide program of contraception counseling and education The report also describes the individual population outlook of 20 developing countries and analyzes the success of population control policies already in place Whenever there has been political commitment and where facilities have been available population rates have come down said Werner Fornos president of the institute Population is one of the few social issues we can solve The report notes that although birth rates worldwide have fallen in recent years death rates have declined more rapidly and the result is an annual increase of 80 million in world population Ninety percent of the increase occurs in the third world Mr Fornos criticized President Reagan for his Administrations decision to withdraw support from global population control efforts The United States was the worlds largest contributor to countries and agencies that conduct family planning programs until recently donating 290 million in the 1984 fiscal year The contribution has fallen since then however and the White House has budgeted 207 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 The Administration has also barred American support for nongovernmental family planning organizations which perform or actively promote abortion Governments that include abortion in their family planning programsare required to keep American aid in a segregated account Mr Fornos contended that this policy and the withdrawal of United States aid to family planning groups have actually led to an increase in abortions Without adequate contraception the number of unwanted pregnancies has increased he said The report recommends increasing the United States contribution to populationreduction efforts to 750 million per year Actions to expand family planning services now may actually save the United States money in the future by making emergency relief efforts less costly the report says
GENETIC DISCOVERIES RAISE PAINFUL QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/21/science/genetic-discoveries-raise-painful-questions.html,ETHICISTS have warned about the quandaries genetic testing would produce since the time about 20 years ago when doctors were first able to learn a childs gender before its birth or determine whether it had Downs syndrome Now a fastgrowing battery of tests that can spot genetic susceptibility to an ever longer list of ailments is forcing doctors ethicists prospective parents and others to face divisive and complex choices In time everyone may have to grapple with these uncomfortable new issues Every healthy person carries four to eight harmful genes said Dr Aubrey Milunsky director of the Center for Human Genetics at Boston University School of Medicine We are all polluted Until prenatal testing became available some people whose relatives had a genetic ailment remained childless rather than risk having children with the disease For them and for women facing the uncertainties of pregnancy late in life genetic screening has been a boon But the aborting of fetuses with severe defects has already caused controversy and heartache And as scientists learn to discern hereditary defects with lesser or uncertain implications for health ethical dilemmas become more intense Among them are questions about who should be tested who can require tests of others and who should have access to the results Experts say knowledge of a persons genetic profile could become a tool for massive discrimination by employers and insurers Scientists can detect evidence of a small but burgeoning number of the 4000 diseases known to be caused by a defect in one or another single gene including Huntingtons disease cystic fibrosis Tay Sachs disease two types of muscular dystrophy and retinoblastoma an eye cancer Scientists have recently also identified genetic markers that in some families signal susceptibility to Alzheimers disease and manic depression conditions that may result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors Further researchers are increasingly able to identify some individuals with a genetic predisposition to more common disorders including atherosclerosis arthritis and diabetes Heredity environment and life style seem to be at play here too A Genetic Profile One can imagine a time when your entire genome could be mapped at birth said George Annas a professor of health law at Boston University School of Medicine Your genetic profile could be used for the rest of your life to determine who you marry what jobs to apply for and for insurance companies to decide if you are a good risk Every time science finds a new way to label people he added there crop up more ways to discriminate Soon it will be possible to screen everybody and there will be pressure to do so according to Margery Shaw a professor of health law at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston California already requires doctors to offer a kind of prenatal screening to all pregnant women It Was All Talk Talk Talk When genetic counselling began in the late 1940s physicians could only explain the odds of having a child with a given birth defect said Dr Shaw It was all talk talk talk Over the years she said many techniques that sample maternal and newborn blood and urine were developed to identify genetic diseases Then in the late 1960s a scientists developed amniocentesis a technique for examining fetal cells obtained from the amniotic fluid in the uterus The test is performed after the 16th week of pregnancy most often on women who are over 35 or who already have a child with a genetic defect More recently scientists developed a technique called chorionic villus sampling using tissue from the placenta It tests fetuses for birth defects after nine to eleven weeks of pregnancy but is not yet widely available outside of research hospitals Now added to these screening techniques are socalled gene probes or genetic marker tests These are tests that search for a targeted sequence of genes that is inherited in families with a genetic defect The marker is not the faulty gene itself but appears with it It is this technique that is producing the continuing explosion of genetic findings The tests are about 95 percent accurate said Dr Shaw You cant be dead sure you have the gene but you are close Test for Huntingtons Disease One of the tests is a gene probe for Huntingtons disease a degenerative brain ailment that strikes around age 40 The gene is dominant so a person whose mother or father has the disease has a 50 percent chance of developing it To find a probe many family members had to donate blood and cooperate with one another About 20000 Americans have the disease and about 200000 of their siblings children and grandchildren are at risk for developing it according to Dr Jason Brandt director of the Huntingtons predictive testing project at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore A second project operates at Massachussets General Hospital in Boston Nearly two thirds of young adults at risk for inheriting the gene say they would like to know if they have it he said and many couples are testing fetuses early in pregnancy and aborting those that test positive But some children of Huntingtons patients say they do not want to know whether they have the gene Others have committed suicide after learning they have it he said In one case a woman already suffering the dementing effects of the disease gave birth to a baby girl According to Michael Conneally of Indiana University Medical Center an official at a registry of people with the disease the child was put up for adoption but one set of prospective parents refused to accept her unless she was free of the gene Doctors refused to perform the test and the child was ultimately adopted by another couple New Questions for Counselors Improvements in testing have given genetic counselors ethical problems said Mark Rothstein director of the health law institute at the University of Houston Suppose I have a genetic condition am about to get married but I dont tell my wife he said Does my doctor have an obligation to tell her Can my wife or our child sue the doctor Suppose I am diagnosed with a genetic disease he went on Do I have a duty to tell my close relatives Does my doctor Can my brother sue me or the doctor If I tell the doctor not to tell and he does can I sue the doctor And these questions are only the beginning experts say When tests are available for susceptibility to heart disease depression or alcholism drug testing is going to look like happy holiday said Arthur Caplan a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in New York Genes are the blueprint that are you he said How will the information be controlled Employers and insurers will want the information experts predict Private companies in most states now have the right to screen employees in any way they want said Prof Rothstein And employers who provide their own health insurance could choose what genetic tests to require and what limitations to impose on coverage Four states  New Jersey Florida Louisiana and North Carolina  regulate testing by employers The New Jersey law says that employers cannot test prospective employees for the gene for Tay Sachs disease on the grounds that an employer might not hire someone whose child was born with the chronic costly ailment Terrible Burden on Women In the long run ethicists say prenatal screening will raise some of the thorniest moral problems How will our value calculus turn out Mr Caplan wondered It is not ethically defensible to have an abortion because a fetus has a probability of having heart disease 50 years from now If parents knew a child has particular odds of developing a particular disease they would spend his whole childhood waiting for the other shoe to drop said Barbara Katz Rothman author of The Tentative Pregnancy a book examining abortion issues These technologies put a terrible burden on women said Ms Rothman You are asking them to evalaute what kind of life is worth living Genetic screening is sold to the public on grounds that it is morally neutral said Mr Caplan and I think that is false Prenatal screening today is done with the intent to terminate pregnancies that are defective The practice is defensible on certain moral grounds My fear is that there will be an inevitable slide down the slope from definition of genetic disease to a promulgation of eugenic goals I dont think we have to make that slide But we shouldnt try to fool ourselves about the choices
"FOR A CATHOLIC DOCTOR, A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/22/nyregion/for-a-catholic-doctor-a-crisis-of-conscience.html,For the last 26 years Dr Hugh Barber has been the director of obstetrics and gynecology at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and an authority on gynecological cancer His resume is crowded with all kinds of credentials and details of his career But there is one important fact missing Dr Barber is a Roman Catholic While being a Catholic may seem irrelevant to being a physician if there is one specialty of medicine that most causes a gulf between religious doctrine and scientific effort it is probably gynecology and obstetrics A Church Affiliation In an act of protest Dr Barber recently resigned as chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Medical College  a private medical school in Valhalla NY that is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York He resigned he said because the college forbade him to hire a doctor who had once written a paper on the ethics of terminating pregnancies which the school found troublesome The school disputes the charge Dr Barber resigned he said over the issue of academic freedom But his resignation has become part of a larger crisis of conscience one that is symbolic of the turmoil that physicians who seek to be at the forefront of their fields but who also seek to maintain their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church have gone through Were in a time of crisis said Dr Barber of medical advances and the lag in determining their ethics The questions posed by the Baby M case and the Vaticans condemnation of surrogate motherhood are the most recent twists in the continuing conflict between the edicts of the Roman Catholic Church and medicines ability to control procreation Dr Barber has not denounced his faith or even questioned it But his struggle to reconcile his professional ethics with his identity as a Roman Catholic has erupted into an interior struggle over his affiliation with the church At the age of 67 he is speaking out for the first time about his doubts concerning the churchs role in medical education as well as its edicts pertaining to medical care He hopes he said that his protest will prompt a discussion between church officials and physicians so that both groups can come up with better answers What bothers me Dr Barber said is that there is no dialogue It is always dictatorial The people making the decisions are removed from the realities of life Since becoming a physician in 1944 Dr Barber has made his own tenuous peace between the demands of his profession and the edicts of his church He said he has never performed an abortion and never will For many years  long after abortion was legalized in New York State  he encouraged gynecologists at Lenox Hill to perform abortions elsewhere But over the years  during a time of vast changes within his field  there were other dictates of the church that gave him trouble he said One was the Vaticans position against birth control The recent edicts against assisting couples who suffer from infertility are others He held his silence he said out of loyalty out of his continued deep faith and out of an equal unhappiness with medicines impersonal methods of using the new technologies Candidates Credentials Praised The final straw came last summer when Dr Barber sought to hire a new physician for New York Medical Colleges department of obstetrics and gynecology The candidate had high academic credentials but was vetoed he said because the candidate had written a paper on the ethics of aborting an anencephalic fetus  one with no brain There is yet no way to save the life of such a child which in virtually all cases dies hours after birth It made me sit down and think about where Ive been where Im now and where Im going  Dr Barber said of his disappointment over the rejection of the candidate in what he has charged was interference by the archdiocese in academic freedom Dr Karl P Adler dean of the medical college has said that academic freedom never came up in discussions over Dr Barbers resignation He said it was his understanding that Dr Barber was no longer in a position to run the schools department of gynecology and obstetrics while also running the department at Lenox Hill The colleges association with the church began in 1978 when the archdiocese achieved a dominant position on the schools board of trustees in exchange for lending the hospital 10 million and rescuing it from threatened bankruptcy Dr Barber said that since resigning he has looked at many things differently I was always totally against abortionsaid Dr Barber But at this point in time I have a deeper insight into it I know that no matter what the national Government says if a young woman wants an abortion she will have one and in the old days many of these young girls would die When I was young I used to look at those deaths as a form of retribution But then I took care of these women and talked to them and emerged with a different feeling Hes Not Sure When Change Began He said he does not know when his current feelings about abortion took root Maybe it was as an intern treating young women who came into the hospital dying of infection because they had had an illegal abortion Maybe it began when he recently toured abortion clinics and found out that Roman Catholics go for abortions in equal numbers as everyone else I appreciate what people go through who are having an abortion he said Dr Barber said he finds he is asking questions he never asked before He wonders for example whether the church should be involved in medical education at all He wonders too whether the Vatican should come up with the answers for Catholics in the United States or whether physicians in this country and their clergymen should find answers for themselves I guess we cannot bring science and theology into complete harmonysaid Dr Barber But at least we should try and talk about it
Judge Acted Bravely in the Baby M Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/23/opinion/l-judge-acted-bravely-in-the-baby-m-decision-882587.html,To the Editor Pardon my skepticism of the criticism leveled in some quarters at the Baby M decision Feminists who would doubtless have supported Mary Beth Whitehead had she decided to abort the child in midpregnancy now rail against her alleged exploitation by the flesh peddlers Roman Catholics and others who oppose abortion and contraception now condemn a contract whereby life is neither prevented nor extinguished but created ex nihilo Lawyers and journalists who licked their chops for months at the prospect of a landmark decision in a matter of vital social importance now complain that the judge overstepped his entitlements as a legal technician For Judge Harvey R Sorkow to ignore the philosophical issues or to rule against the Sterns on the contract and yet to grant them custody would have been byzantine legalism raised to a high art The babys best interests clearly lay with the Sterns Yet vindication of the rights claimed by Mrs Whitehead required that she retain custody or they meant nothing at all Judge Sorkow cut the Gordian knot and deserves our respect if not necessarily our unanimous endorsement for doing so His further decision to permit William Stern to adopt the child formally no doubt stemmed from his determination  quite defensible on the facts  to insure that the Sterns retained custody That after all is the bottom line that all agree the judge had a right to decide Also reasonable was the denial of visitation rights to a woman who once threatened to kill the baby and herself and needs little encouragement to pursue further litigation Surrogacy is a beast in need of taming Baby M is a child in need of suitable parents Judges must satisfy the rights of particular parties to a particular case within their conception of the law They should act bravely Judge Sorkow did SETH A HALPERN Scarsdale NY April 5 1987
JUSTICE POWELL SHAPING LAW AS SWING MAN ON HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/us/justice-powell-shaping-law-as-swing-man-on-high-court.html,He is slender almost frail at 79 years of age a softspoken Virgina gentleman whose friends worry about his health His is not a household name Yet Justice Lewis F Powell Jr has had as powerful an influence as anyone alive today in setting the law of the land on a stunning array of social issues  more than Chief Justice William H Rehnquist more than Chief Justice Rehnquists predecessor Warren E Burger more in a sense than even Ronald Reagan Justice Powell as the man in the middle of the Supreme Courts ideological divide has cast decisive votes in most major 5to4 decisions over the past decade on issues such as the death penalty affirmative action abortion homosexuality and separation of church and state Wrote Historic Opinion His influence was felt once again this week when he wrote the 5to4 majority opinion in the most important capital punishment case of the past decade upholding Georgias system for imposing the death penalty He held that strong statistical evidence that race is a factor in determining who dies does not prove unconstitutional discrimination against any particular defendant While civil rights groups and liberal opponents of the death penalty bitterly deplored that decision many liberals hope for Justice Powells long tenure because his is often a critical vote for their side on issues that include affirmative action abortion rights and religion As a pragmatic centrist who sides sometimes with the closely divided Courts liberals and sometimes with its conservatives Justice Powell is more responsible than anyone else for the Courts issuetoissue zigzagging from right to left in the past 15 years He has helped steer the Court to the right on criminal law issues but not in many other areas While coalitions vary considerably from issue to issue court watchers categorize Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall as relatively consistent liberals and Chief Justices Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia as relatively consistent conservatives The rest of the court is sometimes called the floating center with Justices Byron R White and Sandra Day OConnor leaning to the right on most issues and Justices Harry A Blackmun and John Paul Stevens more often leaning to the left Justice Powells carefully drawn nuanced positions are so often decisive more because of his strategic position on the Courts ideological spectrum than because of any special ability to sway his fiercely independent colleagues who respect him but do not defer to him While Chief Justice Rehnquist on his right and Justice Brennan on his left are more noted for bold consistent constitutional philosophies and sometimes eloquent opinions it is most often Justice Powell who determines who wins For example the 1971 appointee of President Nixon played a key role in the 5to4 decisions last year rejecting the Reagan Administrations broad attacks on abortion rights and affirmative action and in the 6to3 decision last month endorsing more broadly than ever before job preferences for women and minorities Considered Decent and Fair On a personal level he is most often described by friends former clerks and Court personnel as decent hardworking and fairminded highly intelligent though not brilliant with an instinct for narrow solutions and compromise but a tenacity in sticking to a position once he has staked it out Justice Powell is a wealthy former senior partner in a powerful Richmond law firm a former president of the American Bar Association a former head of the school board that presided over the peaceful courtordered desegregation of Richmonds schools a onetime semipro first baseman and decorated World War II Army Air Force combat officer and cryptographer For all that he cuts an unassuming figure He rarely socializes working nights and weekends despite occasional health problems since colon surgery in 1979 and removal of a cancerous prostate in 1985 He speaks softly in a Richmond drawl strolls the Courts hallways unrecognized by most tourists and is uniformly praised for courtliness and courtesy by those dealing with him Justice Powell is not without critics however He has them on the left the right in the Reagan Administration and in the law schools He is most often charged with philosophical inconsistency and writing so many fine distinctions into the law as to sow confusion Difficult to Reconcile The trouble is that hes on both sides of so many issues said Prof Michael W McConnell of the University of Chicago Law School a conservative From term to term and case to case he casts votes that are difficult to reconcile with one another and so over all the effect has been more chaotic than anything else But Prof Vincent Blasi of Columbia Law School said On balance Justice Powells contribution to the Court has been enormously positive He said the complexity and apparent inconsistency in some of the doctrines Justice Powell has crafted are the downside of his effort to be openminded and balanced and that Justice Powell shows his willingness to think past his own ideological preconceptions Lawyers with cases involving ideologically charged issues often go before the Court almost certain that Justice Powells vote will determine whether they win or lose so they pay special attention to his views in setting forth their arguments That is because it can often be predicted that the other eight Justices will split 4 to 4 while Justice Powell ever the careful balancer of competing principles taking each case as it comes is often harder to predict Importance Is Recognized Janet Benshoof an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has a pending case challenging restrictions on minors access to abortion posted a sign on her office door months ago It read How do we get Powell Ms Benshoof said This mildmannered Virginia man has incredible power His vote makes a bigger difference than maybe anybody elses in the whole country on a whole range of issues whether its minors rights or the First Amendment or privacy In many civil rights cases Justice Powell has been the pivotal vote and the general rule is that if Justice Powell is on our side we win said Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights the coalition of major civil rights group If he is on the other side we lose In some cases like the abortion cases he has voted to uphold novel constitutional theories sweeping away dozens of state laws More often as in this weeks death penalty decisions he warns against the Courts overextending its powers A Thread of Consistency If there is a thread of consistency it seems to be a deeply felt personal sense of what justice and decency require springing from a background of moderate patrician conservatism and a close attention to the facts and competing principles in every case This has led Justice Powell  and often the Court  to a relatively liberal record on social issues and a more conservative one on criminal law issues Less than three weeks after the abortion rights decision for example the Court issued another momentous 5to4 ruling upholding against a challenge by a homosexual man a Georgia law that makes anal or oral intercourse a crime Four of the five Justices who had voted to uphold broad abortion rights said the same constitutional right to sexual privacy they had cited there protected private homosexual acts between consenting adults Changed His Mind On the other hand the four Justices who had voted to narrow or overrule the 1973 decision recognizing abortion rights also held that the Constitution did not protect homosexual sodomy Justice Powells was the swing vote He initially had voted in the Courts private conference to strike down sodomy laws and then changed his mind His brief concurrence held that homosexual sodomy unlike abortion was unprotected by the constitutional right to privacy But he also said that if a criminal case were to come along in which someone had been sentenced to prison for sodomy he might vote to strike it down as unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment The case at hand a civil suit raised no such issue The Powell opinion in the sodomy case was joined by no other member of the Court But it is the best single indication of what the law now is Taking the Middle Ground That is because because he staked out a middle ground between the four Justices who would have gone further in one direction and the four who would have gone further in the other The same was true of his solitary concurring opinions in the Courts first major decision upholding some governmental preferences for minorities and disapproving others in 1978 Justice Powell has also seemed sometimes to change his mind or at least his emphasis in cases involving religion and aid to parochial schools Mr McConnell said Justice Powells positions in two cases one in 1977 and one in 1985 were impossible to reconcile and had helped make the law in the area a crapshoot But Mr McConnell who worked at the Court in 1980 as a law clerk for Justice Brennan also said If I had a private dispute and I wanted a gut fair answer to it from some outsider and had to choose among those nine Justices at least back when I knew him in 1980 he would have been my first choice

NEW YORK'S SPINNING LITERARY CIRCLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/magazine/new-york-s-spinning-literary-circles.html,A writers life may be one of dreary solitude but the Literary Life  ah the Literary Life promises glamour fame a seat next to Hemingway as he scribbles immortal prose in a Paris cafe The myth is so alluring it can survive even the most scaleddown atmosphere On a typical New York night for instance David Leavitt Meg Wolitzer and Gary Glickman  all novelists in their 20s and the best of friends  are likely to be having dinner at their favorite restaurant a dingy hole in the wall in the West Village Even as we sit there Glickman says I sometimes wonder Is this it Is it the Cafe de Flore  As Hemingway might have said isnt it pretty to think so A different twist on the literary life in 1980s New York clubs replacing cafes and roaming bands of authors stalking the night streets from Area to Palladium to Nells Jay McInerneys bestselling 1984 novel Bright Lights Big City with its aspiringwriter hero created a hip New York where latenight clubs and cocaine blurs collide with literary ambition Tama Janowitzs Slaves of New York published last year carries on the image in stories full of struggling artists devious gallery owners desperate hangerson all willfully imprisoned by their need to be trendy in the city But these muddled hardpartying characters  when would they ever find the time or the clearheadedness to write  are fictional exaggerations In reality for many young writers today New York is a base where they can strive and grow until they become successful enough or frustrated enough to leave for a while  to spend the summer at a tranquil writers colony or to make money teaching for a year  always returning to replenish themselves in the literary waters and hit some gossipfilled book parties to make contacts with editors agents and publishers Just glance at the itineraries of some of New Yorks hottest young writers Jay McInerney who is 33 spent half of last year in Ann Arbor where his thenwife was finishing her PhD Tama Janowitz 30 has a fellowship at Princeton University this year David Leavitt the shortstory writer whose first novel is The Lost Language of Cranes lives on Long Island Meg Wolitzer author of Hidden Pictures has been teaching upstate Kathy Acker whose latest novel is called Don Quixote the determinedly punkish 38yearold author identified with downtown Manhattan has lived in London for the last two years But New York has lost none of its cachet or importance for these writers no matter where their legal residence they seem to spend as much time in the city as out of it They represent the citys new literary life This is no longer the place where as in years gone by literary circles had real coherence where the mention of the journal Partisan Review conjured up an image of likeminded intellectuals In New York today young authors live in a swifterthansound atmosphere full of energy hype and distractions The change reflects new realities in the city and in the publishing industry higher rents and tougher urban living combined with pressure to bring out a book of fiction before the first blush of youth has passed So aspiring authors find themselves on a harshly competitive fast track as soon as they are out of college or graduate writing programs  if not before No wonder they have little time or taste for Bloomsburycozy salons or Hemingwaymacho feuds Instead there is a dense network of overlapping circles formed from tiny cells Jay McInerney and his friends the flashy successful editors Gary Fisketjon and Morgan Entrekin the trio of precocious whiz kids Leavitt Wolitzer and Glickman  whose first novel Years From Now will be published this summer  and a larger clan of authors in their late 20s and 30s who have passed through Columbia Universitys writing courses The Columbia alumni include Mona Simpson whose first novel Anywhere But Here was published to extravagant praise this year Amy Hempel author of the shortstory collection Reasons to Live and Susan Minot whose first novel Monkeys was a critical hit last year Even the people in Kathy Ackers circle  innovative writers published in little downtown magazines such as Bomb Between C  D and Top Stories  seem about to move into the mainstream The glitzy image of New York as a clubfilled amusement park is not pure hype though any more than it is the simple truth Look at the video Tama Janowitz made Billed as the first literary video it was a brief commercial for Slaves of New York that appeared on cable television last fall Tama with her antiqueshop disheveled earlyMadonna look is seen strutting down the street dining with Andy Warhol and the rock star Debbie Harry sitting in a pink crinoline skirt at a desk in the tiny Horatio Street studio apartment where she then lived A voiceover that brings to mind Life Styles of the Rich and Famous entices viewers to read about New Yorks art scene The color The characters The relationships Is this Tama Janowitzs life Put it this way I dont wake up in the morning and put on a tutu and have makeup artists come over while Im sitting there typing Real life might be one day of me sitting there typing and just making some horrible dinner and then watching TV and the next night might be the night I go to dinner with Andy she said a few months before the pop artists death It takes a certain skewed perspective to be that blase about dinner with Andy Warhol Celebrity aside Janowitz has been writing for years her first novel American Dad was published in 1981 and it will be reissued in June But she didnt find her best subject until she started showing up at gallery openings and clubs hanging around with Interview magazine friends Suddenly her social life gave her something to write about Authors such as Janowitz and McInerney are following the ancient practice of writing about their own social circles But in a complicated twist they have also helped create and perpetuate the artsyclub scene their books depict McInerney says of Bright Lights It was a private version of New York but it becomes a little more real the more its consumed Though the events were more fictional than factual the milieu was certainly real Ill do a reading someplace like Iowa City and people will come up to me and say You made that up didnt you People dont really live like that There are certainly elements of satire and exaggeration in Bright Lights but I took no great liberties with the way people live Now the scene has become more selfconscious The club scene was nascent when I was writing about it it was underground Its hard for anything to be underground now If something below 14th Street pops up on Monday by Tuesday its in the papers I cant be unselfconscious about things that fortunately I was unselfconscious about then In those unselfconscious days only a few years back Jay McInerney Gary Fisketjon and Morgan Entrekin were just three aspiring literary types working at editorial jobs and playing at what turned out to be the research for Bright Lights Now the McInerneyFisketjon friendship stands as the editorwriter myth of our time Numerous newspaper and magazine articles tell of how Fisketjon then a Random House editor began a new now muchimitated paperback series called Vintage Contemporaries the original yuppiebacks launching it with a group of novels that included his old college friends Bright Lights Big City Meanwhile Morgan Entrekin then an editor at Simon  Schuster was helping to define the genre of hipnovelsbybrightkids by acquiring Bret Easton Elliss Less Than Zero Now all three are at Atlantic Monthy Press  McInerneys new publisher where Fisketjon is editorial director and Entrekin has his own imprint We are a sort of galaxy of our own says McInerney of the friendship Entrekin and Fisketjon are better known around town than some of their authors Few writers would be able to tell the story they both do  about going to Nells this years most exclusive restaurant days before it became chic There was a party to celebrate Thomas McGuanes book To Skin a Cat Fisketjon says Susan Minot Tim OBrien Ray Carver Tess Gallagher were there and a group of publishers So after the party a bunch of us jumped outside and flagged the next available car which happened to be a limo  the price was right  to take us down to Nells There must have been 50 people there It was great sort of like a huge rich persons living room and done with some taste Across the room Robert Stone [ the novelist ] was having drinks with somebody from Artforum So the two parties merged Now nobody can get into Nells To Fisketjon this is a story about how a casual evening with friends turned into a press agents extravaganza Thats a wonderful story but its the exception that proves the rule he says To Entrekin it proves there are no real literary salons I thought that night Nells might be able to turn into a kind of literary salon it was lowkeyed he says But the next time I went it was full of the kind of people who dont work for a living who really do nothing but go to clubs all the time Either way the anecdote reveals how their corner of the literary world intersects with a flashier social scene And of course they still go to Nells In this dizzy overlapping world Tama Janowitz also showed up at Nells early on Yet Janowitz has been published in the staid New Yorker and in the downtown journals Bomb Between C  D and Top Stories Chameleonlike she projects both fasttrack fame and downtown artiness fitting everywhere and nowhere at once In high school she says there were these cliques  the cheerleaders the greasers the ones with the motorcycles in the parking lot the hippies smoking marijuana  all these little circles I remember my mother telling me Youre not going to fit into any clique now but in real life there arent any cliques But the truth is that in real life especially in New York there are cliques There are all these little villages Janowitz is not the only one to notice literary New Yorks village mentality Mona Simpson is a Paris Review editor whose impeccable literary connections include the Reviews editor George Plimpton and her former teacher Elizabeth Hardwick She compares the New York literary scene to George Eliots Victorian community Its like Middlemarch like youve entered a 19thcentury novel she says I remember running into David Leavitt and Susan Minot at an Alice Munro reading It was a rainy miserable night and none of us wanted to be out but we all turned up at this reading by one of our favorite writers It gives you a sense of life as plot having a large acquaintanceship You catch up with people you havent seen in a year so someone will have had a baby or moved into a new apartment You dont see the texture as much But everyone in the room will have read Proust Of course most literary New Yorkers like most Middlemarchers see each other a lot more than once a year and they exist in a web of relationships as tangled as any a town gossip could hope for Charted the connections might resemble a Faulknerian geneology listed they look like the stuff of a good soap opera While in graduate school at Columbia for instance Mona Simpson met Amy Hempel Susan Minot and Nancy Lemann the 31yearold author of the novel Lives of the Saints Susan and Nancy first knew each other at Brown University where Gary Glickman later shared an apartment with Meg Wolitzer who eventually introduced him to David Leavitt with whom Gary now lives in East Hampton David and Gary and Meg are good friends with Amy and they know Susan and Mona and Nancy And recently Meg who is teaching this year at Skidmore College in Saratoga NY met Jay who was spending some time nearby at Yaddo the writers colony Jay who blurbed Monas book also knows Susan who was introduced to her publisher by Morgan Entrekin whom she knew around town A literary circle suggests some coherence some common goals says Leavitt This is more like a game of Lego where you know someone who knows someone else who knows someone else At its best this smalltown atmosphere serves a useful purpose New York is a hopper of conversation about books and a lot of literary gossip says Meg Wolitzer When you open the Times Book Review on Sunday theres almost always the name of somebody you know It makes you feel you have a world of writers Because writers arent like actors who work together we wish for that community so we try to create it But as Gordon Lish admits this is no utopian community Lish is an editor at Knopf who also edits a new literary journal The Quarterly Many of the writers who have passed through his notoriously competetive workshops at Columbia University in which they are required to bare their souls and have the results set up against each other have remained close friends And many have been published by Gordon Lish Having endured combat together he says facetiously holds people together He also observes There is a community that provides shared experience for work but there is a price to be paid in the distracting effects of envy of the comparisons in terms of small successes When the frame of competition is aimed at the right models  at the excellence of the composition of sentences  something quite wonderful can happen If attention is paid to advances or who is getting published or to statements made by some other writer over beer one day it can be pernicious Competition comes easily because literary New York is a microcosm of the homogeneous yuppie middle class where women have made faster gains than blacks and there seems to be a disproportionate number of Ivy Leaguers It can become claustrophobic Nancy Lemann spends part of the year in her native New Orleans Writers need a certain amount of real life around them she says You cant just chronicle other writers hanging around in nightclubs New Orleans is my connection to everything real and good and true There are families and gardens people have cast in their lots there Many other authors also value the fresh perspectives available outside the city New York is a kind of Wonderland says McInerney You start to take the laws of Manhattan as the laws of nature when nothing could be farther from the truth Often they head out of the city merely to get a respite from its social demands Thats one reason why Tama Janowitz is at Princeton why McInerney admits he must leave New York in order not to go out every night why David Leavitt moved to Long Island from Manhattan I couldnt work there anymore says Leavitt It was getting to be overwhelming  not just the noise and traffic but the distractions of the literary life of knowing everything about every book everyone is publishing On any gven night theres a publishing party or a reading And he adds I got sick of living in one room As one of many writers who has not graduated to a fullsized apartment Meg Wolitzer says We go out to eat all the time because its necessary to leave our cubbyhole apartments In New York its so distracting  if I want to wander through rooms I have to go outside Thats why so many writers go to writers colonies none of us in the city has an ideal writing workspace If there is an exception to the homogeneity of literary New York it would seem to be Kathy Ackers downtown crowd Although David Leavitts psychological realism and homosexual themes could never be confused with Jay McInerneys smooth irony and hip people and while McInerneys discontented characters are weightier than Janowitzs these writers are all traditional mainstream stylists But Acker with her black crew cut gold front tooth rose tattoo on her arm and eight earrings in her left ear writes as untraditionally as she looks Her latest novel Don Quixote is a typical Acker fiction a fragmented narrative that usurps and reinvents a classic turning Don Quixote into a woman traumatized by an abortion Last fall dozens of Ackers friends climbed rickety stairs to a Hudson Street apartment to celebrate the publication of Don Quixote There was a campy air of parody in the room  a female bartender with masses of orangered hair was dressed in a French maids costume men wore eyeliner almost everyone wore black They seemed to be the irreverent heirs of Jack Kerouac updating a scene from the 50s Only when old friends hugged Acker and welcomed her back did it became clear that this was not a ritual gathering of the 80s avantgarde but a homecoming I couldnt afford to live in New York Acker says of her move to London where her work is better known But I miss my friends so Im thinking of looking for a teaching job so I can come back The downtown writers who welcomed Acker home walk talk and look like a genuine literary circle one that includes some of the most innovative voices on the scene  authoreditors in their mid to late 30s like Betsy Sussler and Craig Gholson of Bomb magazine Anne Turyn of Top Stories Catherine Texier and Joel Rose of Between C  D But many of them regard the late 70s as their glory days when artists and writers and filmmakers ran into each other at the nowclosed Mudd Club before the dispersing effects of success and encroaching middle age had set in The movement among Kathy Ackers friends now is not out of town but  like it or not  toward the establishment Just as several years ago the downtown art scene was discovered by mainstream art dealers the press and the public many of the authors whose fiction has appeared in Bomb or Between C  D are now breaking through to major publishers even though like Ackers their work has a sharper edge than the realism of most of the younger betterknown writers  being fragmented openended more forthright in its language and in its depiction of sex and drugs Grove press is even planning to bring out Kathy Ackers collected works Betsy Sussler was a writer and actress before she started Bomb in 1981 and began publishing fiction by a lot of the Mudd Club crowd In those days she says you felt like you werent alone There were gallery openings conceptual artists filmmakers theater people There was an art community and a lot of untraditional narrative Blending artwork with poetry and fiction Bomb has developed over the years into a polished sophisticated magazine where the work of new artists stands beside interviews with betterknown authors like Angela Carter and Martin Amis  writers whose own sly irreverent fiction would fit comfortably into the magazine And Bombs early contributors have flourished In addition to Ackers Don Quixote the magazine excerpted Haunted House a novel by Lynne Tillman  a filmmaker and former Mudd Club devotee  which was recently published by Simon  Schusters Poseidon Press Poseidon will also bring out Blood and Water and Other Tales by Patrick McGrath a contributing editor of both Bomb and Between C  D It was important to have parts of Haunted Houses published in Bomb says Tillman If youre living in New York you have to be aware of what the city holds Otherwise you could be in Des Moines thinking The New Yorker is the only place to send your stories The irony is that as the downtown authors become more successful they also become more dispersed Perhaps thats simply the nature of literary circles  by the time you can point to them theyve already dispersed But the readings that used to take place every week are rare these days There is more solitary work finishing a novel less hanging out with friends while groping to find a literary voice And in the late 70s loft spaces were enormous and cheap Lynne Tillman says Now people have started moving into smaller spaces and were five years older Theres more socializing in restaurants meeting for dinner and keeping in touch on the phone Even though the social life has died down says Betsy Sussler Weve spent 10 years building up this support group In your heart you feel like a group but socially no Catherine Texier and Joel Roses apartment is a perfect example of how mainstream meets downtown hightech meets hardedged fiction In a rapidly improving block on East Seventh Street they have a large twostory apartment filled with sunlight the drawings of their 6yearold daughter and the word processor on which they create Between C  D Texier a Paris native who has worked as a journalist in Montreal and New York looks and sounds like a stylish young mom resembling not at all the emotionally ragged heroine of her extraordinary novel Love Me Tender An explicit look at sex and survival on the Lower East Side the novel is full of powerful sensuous language the central character is a sexually voracious gogo dancer whose lovers include a kindly drug dealer and a sadistic artist The novel will appear in June as a paperback original in the mainstream Penguin Contemporary American Fiction series But Rose and Texier began the magazine  it is actually a computer printout a string of pages complete with sprockets on the sides sold in a ziplock bag  three years ago because they felt that the world of universitypublished journals was closed to them In fact Texier recalls that the Paris Review turned down one of her stories They said it didnt feel like a finished story it was fragmented there was a sense of not being closed  which I wanted she says Rose went through the Columbia writing program but hated the experience  it was all about making contacts and getting ahead in your career he says not about writing Nonetheless he has worked as a television script doctor for Kojack and  Miami Vice and has an grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to complete his novel which is being looked at by mainstream publishers For all their their irony in the face of the mainstream some downtown writers seem to have a petty case of McInerneyenvy It is a fact if not an affectation that many of them stumble as they try to pronounce his name  a problem not common in any other segment of the publishing world Whats he going to do now write his great Ann Arbor novel asks one As it happens McInerneys new novel is set in New York which with all its distractions remains the metaphorical wellspring for young writers Perhaps its even a literal wellspring New York is built over a mineral spring which in legend youre not supposed to do says Cookie Mueller the the Details magazine columnist and actress who also writes fiction Living over water makes people crazy It gives them too much energy That might explain the frenetic literary crosshatchings the scramble that is not after all about the isolated act of writing but about the wildly different communal acts of friendship and fame At a Christmas party Harpers magazine gave at the Acme Bar  Grill  a place so down and dirty its cool the room was full of junior editors and struggling freelance writers whose names are better known to each other than to the public As one of them said I have friends who are writers If 50 years from now it turns out that were all famous well have been a literary circle If not well have been a group of friends who were writers
WIVES CONFRONT SPOUSES' HOMOSEXUALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/27/style/wives-confront-spouses-homosexuality.html,Every other Sunday or so they gather in a living room on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to reflect on their lives as wives of homosexual or bisexual men Each woman contributes something to the potluck supper held after the meeting and since the meetings tend to get teary a group leader Aurele Samuels contributes the Kleenex The scene is like a floating crap game Ms Samuels said Some women appear at one or two meetings and are never seen again Others return for months and even years until they have talked enough and drawn enough strength from the group to come to terms with their marriages Seated in the circle on recent Sunday were a dozen women mostly mothers each at a different point in a common journey A woman in the antiques business recalled watching with mixed emotions as her husband of 22 years moved out of their house in New Jersey The parting was painful she said even though she has been seeing a man who makes me feel like a woman again A Brooklyn schoolteacher called her husbands lover a friend and her sexless marriage a compromise She and her husband belong to a support group of couples in the same boat she said The two newcomers were both married to clergymen The ministers wife who was 14 years older than her husband said she knew of his homosexuality before the marriage and invited his lover to live with them By the time she learned the truth the rabbis wife had one child by him and was pregnant again She had an abortion because they decided to divorce Increasingly the AIDS crisis is focusing attention on the oncehidden lives of women whose male partners are homosexual or bisexual It is raising concern as well that the partners sexual behavior past or present places the women at grave risk of acquired immune deficiency syndrome Health Authorities View Sex researchers estimate that about 20 percent of the male homosexual population or 4 million men marry at least once No one can say how many of their wives may be at risk of AIDS because of the many variables for example the extent of the husbands sexual activity inside and outside the marriage Health authorities are concerned that wives who are unaware their husbands are homosexual cannot make informed choices The women in the support group knew and yet they said the disease does not dominate their discussions or even their thoughts He practices safe sex is a common remark Or Hes only involved with one man The man Im sure hes not promiscuous When Ms Samuels began working with the group five years ago nobody mentioned AIDS Today she said theyre talking about it but unfortunately not nearly enough She added that she has encouraged at least 65 female partners of homosexuals or bisexuals half of them group members  to be tested for the virus Only two women in the group have done so she said both with negative results Fear is part of the reason Another part is the belief expressed by an interior designer in her 30s that another piece of bad news would be too much to bear Did you see Safe Sex she asked referring to the trio of oneact plays by Harvey Fierstein that had a brief run on Broadway recently The guy dies of AIDS and who ends up being a carrier The exwife not the lover I couldnt handle that Im still in shock to find the man I married is gay The truth often comes as a shock to judge by the preliminary results of a study by Ms Samuels and Dr Dorothea Hays an Adelphi University associate professor of nursing Its findings to be published in the Journal of Homosexuality were based on the responses of 36 women to a 28page questionnaire exploring their experiences as the wives of homosexual or bisexual men and the mothers of the mens children Roughly 85 percent of the women said they believed the men were heterosexual when they married Those who knew otherwise said their reason for marrying was not to cure him of homosexuality Like most others they said it was love What most attracted them to the men were qualities such as kindness and sensitivity along with good looks and sex appeal Rarely was the mens support for feminism a factor although a few women found the men less macho than others they had known Drawn from support groups for such wives in Boston New York Philadelphia and Washington the women in the survey ranged in age from 32 to 62 years The average age was 47 Most had college degrees and professional jobs At the time of the survey they had been married an average of 19 years and had discovered the mans sexual orientation four years earlier It was often years later that the women realized that the blame they had assumed for strains in the marriage and the explanations they had invented for their husbands puzzling behavior made no sense The reasons they gave before they knew appeared to be excuses later but they couldnt see it at the time Ms Samuels said To have seen it would have been to undermine a relationship they wanted to hold on to Noting that half of the women were married and living with their husbands at the time of the survey Dr Hays added Some are still holding on for dear life in spite of the fact that it doesnt feel so good They deny a lot which is true of abused wives and alcoholics wives Still only three of the wives surveyed insisted they would never divorce all were married to men who identified themselves as bisexuals with their only female partners being their wives The wives felt free to have affairs with other men under openmarriage contracts Many other marriages in the survey were troubled well before the mans sexual activity came to light Gradually the wives recalled the men grew moody and began to withdraw from them first physically and then emotionally As one woman put it I felt like he was doing me a favor when we made love Staring into the mirror others decided it was their fault They dieted exercised bought sexy nightgowns to no avail Somebody Else I remember thinking Oh hes found somebody else the Brooklyn schoolteacher in the support group said I was on the right track but I never dreamed it was a man When he told me I said You cant be gay If he were effeminate maybe that would have crossed my mind Six years later their daughter is now 9 and their marriage remains intact although sexual relations stopped three years ago Thats not to say were not close in other ways the schoolteacher said Our straight friends have so many problems  alcohol drugs wife abuse poor communications Just because they have sex doesnt make their marriages any better The fact that my husband is happy in his relationship helps our relationship because he doesnt bring home any worries For others the adjustment was harder The disclosure left them feeling bewildered jealous betrayed angry guilty disgusted and repulsed Looking back on the nights she waited at home alone thinking her husband was working to advance his career one wife said I reacted with rage to find out that he was cruising Despite such reactions onefourth of the wives believed they would have felt worse if the husband had been involved with a woman They saw another woman as direct competition or proof of personal inadequacy But many more would have welcomed a female rival and a fighting chance
SCIENCE WATCH; TREATING ECTOPIC PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/28/science/science-watch-treating-ectopic-pregnancy.html,ECTOPIC pregnancies in which the fertilized egg develops outside the uterus have been successfully terminated in nine women without surgery using direct injection of prostaglandin into the oviduct according to a recent account in the British medical journal Lancet In the most common form of ectopic pregnancy the fertilized egg instead of descending into the uterus implants itself in one of the ducts leading from the ovaries to the uterus Unless removed or discharged its development can rupture the tube often resulting in the womans death Standard practice is to remove the tube occasionally with its associated ovary but the Lancet report noted that this procedure is associated with a considerable risk of subsequent infertility as well as with the general hazards of abdominal operations In the new procedure reported by obstetricians at the University of Goteborg in Sweden a small amount of prostaglandin F is injected directly above the implanted embryo The prostaglandins to varying degrees induce uterine contractions They have been used to aid in labor and also to induce abortion The Swedish group reported that having tested various prostaglandins they have found that type F induced the most powerful contractions By injecting a small amount directly into the tube they said they avoided such side effects as vomiting and diarrhea from heavier doses The patients were those whose pregnancies seemed best suited to the treatment The authors note that the substance injected and dose size might not be the best and that it remained to be determined how large a range of cases are suitable for the new therapy Authors of the report in the April 4 Lancet were B Lindblom B Kallfelt M Hahlin and L Hamberger

"POPE, IN GERMANY, ASSAILS ABORTION AND MERCY KILLING",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/01/world/pope-in-germany-assails-abortion-and-mercy-killing.html,Pope John Paul II arriving for the start of a fiveday tour of West Germany called on the nations bishops today to step up their efforts to halt the spread of abortions and mercy killings comparing such actions to the killing of invalids and the terminally ill under the Nazi regime The Pope said the frighteningly high number of abortions and the increase in the illicit practice of socalled mercy killings meant that the mission to protect life has again assumed great significance and urgency for us bishops in todays society The reference was evidently to the increase in legal abortions in many northern European countries and the mild attitude toward the voluntary death of the elderly and terminally ill in some countries such as the Netherlands The Popes tour of 11 West German cities is to focus on the experience of German Catholics under Nazism against the backdrop of a renewed discussion of the Holocaust and its significance for presentday Germans Two to Be Beatified The main feature of the Popes trip his second to West Germany will be the beatification of two Germans At a mass in Cologne on Friday the Pope will elevate Edith Stein to the status of blessed the last step before sainthood Miss Stein a Jewishborn philosopher and writer converted to Catholicism and entered a Carmelite convent She was taken from the convent in 1942 and killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz On Sunday in Munich John Paul will beatify Rupert Mayer a priest who was persecuted by the Nazis for his persistent criticism of their regime The decision to beatify Miss Stein has been criticized by members of her family and by leaders of Jewish groups who saw in it an effort to claim for Roman Catholicism a woman who had been killed because she was a Jew Churches Role Defended Addressing members of the German Bishops Conference this evening the Pope defended the role of Christian churches under Nazism and stressed the importance they possessed in resisting its spread The role of the Catholic clergy in the 12year rule of Hitler has been extremely controversial in Germany since the publication in the 1960s of The Vicar a drama by the German playwright Rolf Hochhuth criticizing the role of the church under Pope Pius XII for having failed to act to save European Jewry Pope John Paul was welcomed under rainy slategray skies at Cologne Airport by Joseph Cardinal Hoffner the chairman of the German Bishops Conference and by President Richard von Weizsacker and Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher On Friday in Munster in northern Germany the Pope will honor the memory of Clemens August Cardinal Graf von Galen the aristocratic Archbishop of that city who was virtually the sole Catholic prelate to assail Nazi atrocities from the pulpit Though West Germany is often viewed as a predominantly Protestant country Catholics make up roughly half the nations population of some 60 million people But the numbers do not fully reflect the wealth or influence of the German church within Catholicism A system of tithes collected by the civil government for church authorities has guaranteed considerable wealth even at a time when national churches elsewhere are suffering financially

MAN IN THE NEWS; LUTHERAN CONCILIATOR: Herbert Walfred Chilstrom,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/02/us/man-in-the-news-lutheran-conciliator-herbert-walfred-chilstrom.html,After an election that required nine ballots over two days the newly formed Evangelical Lutheran Church in America today chose as its first Bishop a man with a reputation for openness and reconciliation the Rev Herbert Walfred Chilstrom of Minneapolis The delegates who elected Bishop Chilstrom had no better example of his talents than in his family life while he has been a minister of the Lutheran Church in America his wife served as a minister of the American Lutheran Church The two branches were the largest participants in the merger that created the new denomination which has 53 million members The third partner in the union which was approved here Thursday was the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches One Family of God I will promise I will do my very best to respect the traditions that flow into this new church said the Bishop his voice cracking with soreness and emotion after the long election ended late today I will work to hasten the day when we really feel we are one family of God Bishop Chilstrom defeated a fellow Minnesotan Bishop David W Preus of the American Lutheran Church and two New Yorkers the Rev William H Lazareth and the Rev Barbara K Lundblad Bishop Chilstrom will lead the fourth largest Protestant denomination in the United States with 16608 pastors and 11022 congregations The new Bishop who will be installed Oct 10 had been the Bishop of the Minnesota Synod of the Lutheran Church in America since 1976 The new Lutheran church represents nearly twothirds of the Lutherans in the United States Organizers of the new church hope to project the image of a broadly based church that appeals beyond its historic constituency of Germans and Scandinavians to include blacks and people of Hispanic and Asian descent Among the problems he is expected to face is dissatisfaction among congregations over the merger About 800 largely conservative congregations voted against it and up to 100 are expected to withdraw from the new denomination because of outstanding theological differences Bishop Chilstrom said he would devote much of his energy to the congregations We need to nurture the life of believers in our congregations he said Here is where we baptize and teach Here is where we serve A Call for Unity The new Bishop also addressed another challenge the new church will face its outreach to other Christian churches The three denominations that make up the new Lutheran church had sought to find common ground with other denominations But one branch emphasized outreach to Roman Catholics another made approaches to Presbyterians and members of Reformed Christian churches Bishop Chilstrom said all of the efforts would continue And he presented his guiding philosophy to such endeavors Jesus did not command us to go and make Lutherans of all nations The ecumenical quest is always for greater unity among the children of God Bishop Chilstrom a tall and lanky 55yearold with curly white hair is softspoken and describes himself as a evangelical conservative with a radical social conscience His position on abortion is somewhat more restrictive than that of the merged denominations which believed that abortion may be a moral decision He called abortion a tragic option that should be exercised only when the health of the mother is at risk or in the case of rape Bishop Chilstrom has said that the new church should reexamine its position Subtle Campaigning One criticism heard of Bishop Chilstrom during two days of subtle campaigning for the office was that he was not forceful enough to project the image the new church seeks Delegates said they turned to him in the final vote in part because of problems with the other candidates Bishop Preus was seen as too closely identified with his denomination Dr Lazareth a major Lutheran theologian was viewed as too cerebral according to one delegate and Ms Lundblad was a woman in a church that never had a woman in a position of religious leadership Another aspect that may have helped Bishop Chilstrom was the fact that he and his wife the Rev Corinne Chilstrom nicely bridged the two major Lutheran branches She was ordained in 1985 and serves as an assistant pastor at the Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Minneapolis Sustained by Faith The Chilstroms say that their faith helped sustain them after the suicide of their 18yearold son Andrew in 1984 They have two other children Christopher 25 and Mary 26 Bishop Chilstrom is a graduate of Augsburg College in Minneapolis and Augustana Seminary in Rock Island Ill which is now the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago He also has advanced degrees from Princeton Seminary in Princeton NJ and New York University He has served as a pastor at several parishes in Minnesota and served at Luther College in Teaneck NJ as a professor of biblical studies and an academic dean In the Chilstroms home are two mememtos that say a great deal about the background of the new Bishop There is a bowl that holds the water with which he was baptized in Litchfield Minn And there is the family Bible that his greatgrandparents brought from Sweden 130 years ago Both treasures he said continue to preach to me the Good News

"MALE AND FEMALE, MEN AND WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/books/male-and-female-men-and-women.html,LEAD THE SECRET MUSEUM Pornography in Modern Culture By Walter Kendrick 288 pp New York Viking 1895 THE SECRET MUSEUM Pornography in Modern Culture By Walter Kendrick 288 pp New York Viking 1895  TODAY in America there are few issues that arouse more intense and emotional conflict than the free availability of pornography Very rarely in Western history has pornography both visual and written been so readily available to all who want it rich and poor alike Our society is historically unique in the scale and intensity of its saturation with sexual imagery and its preoccupation with sexual satisfaction Walter Kendrick begins The Secret Museum with a hilarious account of how scholars in the 18th and 19th centuries tried to deal with some discoveries in the excavation of the Roman city of Pompeii It turned out to be a place not only full of brothels but with phalluses sprouting at every street corner and private houses containing rooms decorated with lasciviously obscene frescoes At a time when Greek and Roman civilization formed the core curriculum for upperclass males and was the object of virtually unqualified admiration how were such discoveries to be dealt with First the City of Naples put embarrassing frescoes and sculptures in a locked room in the museum but this did not work since men  not women  with money have always been able to bribe their way in Another strategy was to interpret the finds as mere symbols of generation based on antiquated religious notions A third was to bowdlerize the published engravings of the objects so that the phalluses taper off like uptilted icicles Within half a century of the invention of movable type and the wood block Aretino and Giulio Romano had been turning out copies of the first blatantly explicit Western sex manual accompanied by a pornographic text But Mr Kendrick is basically correct when he observes that one of the most remarkable facts about hardcore pornography before the 19th century is how little of it there was Mass reproduction of such material only became possible when the technology of photography was added to that of linotype printing During the 16th to 18th centuries there was an intellectual separation of sexuality from the moral legal and religious contexts in which it had been imbedded ever since the great puritan revolution of the thirdfourth century AD By the end of the 19th century the separation was complete leaving us with a notion of sex as something like advanced calisthenics and pornography as pure erotic fantasy designed to stimulate mostly male desire Mr Kendrick takes us through the obsessively scholarly Victorian bibliophiles and the luxuriant outcrop of Victorian pornography that circulated among a tiny elite of highly educated wealthy gentlemen He also describes the frantic efforts of censorship to keep the lid on from the prosecution of John Wilkes for his Essay on Woman an obscene parody of Alexander Popes Essay on Man in the mid18th century through the failed attempts to suppress the writings of de Sade to the prosecution of Flaubert for Madame Bovary in 1857 The last was one of the earliest examples of how the indictment of a book as obscene has a stimulating effect on its sales In the same year 1857 England passed the Obscene Publications Act In 1873 America was bullied and pushed by the tireless activities of Anthony Comstock into passing a similar Federal law most of the individual states had already done so This set the stage for the battle over pornography which was to last for almost exactly a century culminating in the shattering defeat of the censors in the 1950s and 60s Without telling us why Mr Kendrick describes how opinion slowly shifted in the early 20th century with judicial decisions following lamely in its wake At first authors and artists had a hard time for many judges took the reasonable line that the better an obscene book is written the greater the public to whom it is likely to appeal a position that ruled out the redeeming social value argument based on artistic merit MR KENDRICK sees the turn of the tide with the admission into the United States of Joyces Ulysses in 1933 At that time there occurred the first beginning of the distinction between art and pornography based on intent This raised the problem of defining the latter which has plagued lawyers and judges ever since leading Associate Justice Potter Stewart to declare in 1964 with understandable irritation but monumental lack of legal clarity I know it when I see it His definition was based not on the intent of the artist or author but the subjective response of the observer or reader In 1957 Associate Justice William J Brennan and the majority of the Supreme Court finally set out the guidelines the First Amendment does not cover obscenity obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest it is utterly without redeeming social importance and the test of obscenity is whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards the dominant theme of the material appeals to prurient interest This was all well and good in 1957 but 30 years later contemporary community standards have changed so much that blatantly pornographic videotapes books and magazines are now readily available and quickly sold to an apparently insatiable public The supply and marketing of pornography is now very big business indeed and the Supreme Court has been struggling all this time to decide what if anything it should do about it Even by 1970 before the development of videotapes and the VCR 85 percent of American adult men and 70 percent of women admitted they had seen explicit sexual material of some kind The last 15 years Mr Kendrick defines as the postpornographic era A Presidential Commission in 1970 found no evidence to date that exposure to explicit sexual materials plays a significant role in the causation of delinquent or criminal behavior  only to have these findings rejected by a nervous Congress in an election year and denounced by President Nixon as morally bankrupt Soon afterward a small group of zealous feminists decided that pornography is a major threat to women since it depicts them as sexual objects Pornography Susan Brownmiller declared like rape is a male invention designed to dehumanize women to reduce the female to an object of sexual access Mr Kendrick has some slight sympathy with Ms Brownmiller but none at all with Andrea Dworkin Staccato repetitive incantatory Dworkins style is that of an enraptured demagogue The last twist of the story of this longstanding battle between libertarians and censors is the publication this year of yet another official commission this time launched and carefully selected by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d This fatuous document as Mr Kendrick calls it asserts that there is a clear relationship between pornography and antisocial behavior  the exact opposite of the findings of the 1970 Presidential Commission The fact is that we simply do not know the effect of pornography on crimes of violence or even on the nature of our culture We can all agree that the exploitation of children for pornography is obnoxious and perhaps also sexual violence but further than that it is impossible at this stage to go In the last resort I believe that this prolonged pornography debate is a red herring distracting attention from a much broader and deeper moral and social question  what exactly is the role we should attribute to sexuality in human life and to what extent are we willing to subordinate the search for the ultimate orgasm to other social and moral goods such as stable marriages or legitimate births or a curb on venereal diseases We have hardly even begun seriously to discuss whether Freudian theories the media contraceptive and electronic technology antibiotics and the ideology of the unrestricted pursuit of individual happiness have together led us into something of a trap Have we got sex on the brain and are our priorities distorted as a result Mr Kendrick is wholeheartedly on the side of the libertarians  as am I with reservations  but he barely touches on these profounder historical questions of the cultural and moral causes and consequences of his story AN INSATIABLE DESIRE TO SEE EVERYTHING  In a recent interview Walter Kendrick said there is a grotesque similarity between feminist opposition to pornography now and crusades against it through the ages They dont want to liberate women at large he said of Women Against Pornography and similar groups they want to marshal the police and courts to do their bidding I think what they want is power as it exists right now They dont want to restructure it they just want to move into it Pornography created for a female audience is beginning to emerge for the first time in Western history according to Mr Kendrick Although pornography created for women is similar to most maleoriented pornography he said women prefer that erotica be cast in situations and stories rather than just portray the hydraulics of the sex act Historically Mr Kendrick said by phone in New York the notion that women might have a taste for pornography was an inconceivable and frightening idea to both men and women because it suggested that women could control their sexuality rather than having all sexual pleasure initiated by men Pornography that shows women in pain and the humiliation of women as well as acts of violence against them is a relatively minor portion of all the available pornographic literature he asserted Actually pornography hasnt changed very much over the years Basically what goes on in Fanny Hill is what goes on in your runofthemill videotape he said Mr Kendrick a senior editor of The Village Voice who is on leave from his post as professor of English at Fordham University views the current abundance of pornography as a subcategory of a larger phenomenon  the explosion of images of all kinds In itself he asserted pornography is neither healthy nor sick There just seems to be an insatiable desire to see everything Mr Kendrick said that daily life in India China Japan and other Eastern cultures has been infused with sexually explicit material for centuries but the furor about it seems to be confined to the West ALEX S JONES
WASHINGTON TALK: CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES; MANY BENEFIT AS THE SPOTLIGHT TURNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/04/us/washington-talk-congressional-inquiries-many-benefit-as-the-spotlight-turns.html,Harry S Truman was a relatively obscure senator from Missouri in 1941 when he started an investigation into profiteering by military contractors Three years later he was elected Vice President and within months he was President one of many politicians over the years who used a Congressional investigation as a springboard to prominence Richard M Nixon and Howard H Baker Jr also came to national prominence through Congressional committee hearings  Mr Nixon through his participation in 1948 in the House UnAmerican Activities Committees investigation of Alger Hiss and Mr Baker 25 years later at the start of the Senate Watergate Committee hearings on President Nixon in 1973 with his constantly repeated question What did the President know and when did he know it Three years later he was elected Republican leader of the Senate and he is now White House chief of staff No one can predict confidently who will be the political stars of the hearings that begin Tuesday on the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels known as contras Indeed sometimes Congressional investigations bring politicians notoriety rather than fame That of course was the case with Senator Joseph R McCarthy who was eventually censured by the Senate for his conduct during hearings in the 1950s into Communism in the American Government But as the Irancontra inquiry progresses through the spring and summer some of the lawmakers involved seem to be especially well positioned to enhance their careers Here are some of them Senator Daniel K Inouye The most successful politician in Hawaiis history he entered the House of Representatives after Hawaii became a state in 1959 and was elected to the Senate in 1962 But despite his many years in Congress he has never been chairman of a major standing committee and has rarely been in the public eye Now as chairman of the special Senate investigative committee he will surely get public exposure and his deep resonant voice and serious determined manner are made to order for television If he does as well as his colleagues expect Senator Inouye who is 62 years old will be the oddson favorite to become Senate majority leader when Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia steps down Representative Lee H Hamilton When members of the House of Representatives are asked which of their colleagues they most respect Mr Hamilton an Indiana Democrat is near the top of almost everyones list Partly that is because he eschews selfpromotion Mostly it is because he picks his issues so carefully masters them so thoroughly and argues them so coherently His chairmanship of the special House investigative committee will give the public a look at why he is so highly regarded He is not likely to run for higher office But at 57 Mr Hamilton is almost a cinch to become chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the years ahead and to use that position to become one of the top foreign policy spokesmen in Congress Senator Warren B Rudman Elected to his second term from New Hampshire last fall Mr Rudman the top Republican on the Senate panel first gained prominence with his cosponsorship with Senators Phil Gramm a Texas Republican and Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina of the law requiring automatic budget deficit reductions He is an excellent lawyer and a former prosecutor who prides himself in his ability to question witnesses With his moderate political views accessibility to reporters and armslength relationship to the Administration Senator Rudman 56 strikes many colleagues as being in a political position similar to that which Mr Baker held at the outset of the Watergate hearings Representative Dick Cheney Only 46 he is not only the top Republican on the House investigative committee but also a senior member of the House Republican leadership although he has been in Congress only eight years The White House chief of staff under President Ford he knows the workings of the executive branch of the Government as well as anyone in Congress His admirers say his political future is limitless and many say it will be determined in part by the way Mr Cheney who comes from Wyoming handles himself in these hearings Senator George J Mitchell He became a Senator almost by accident picked from the Federal judiciary in 1980 to fill the Maine Senate seat of Edmund S Muskie after Mr Muskie became Secretary of State Since then he has won election in his own right and has gained the respect of his colleagues by mastering the details of complicated matters like tax and environmental legislation He also won high marks for heading the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in the successful election victory last year He has taken a leading role in the Congressional investigation guided by his experience as a prosecutor and judge Other committee members say he is one of those whose views they listen to most carefully At 53 he seems well placed to move into a Senate leadership position Representative Henry J Hyde The public knows Mr Hyde best for his sponsorship of legislation bearing his name that bars Federal financing of abortions for poor women But within the House the Illinois Republican is known most for his strong intellect legal skills and ability as a debater If the hearings take on a partisan tone he may emerge as President Reagans most forceful defender Senators Paul S Sarbanes and William S Cohen Mr Sarbanes a Maryland Democrat and Mr Cohen a Maine Republican won their Senate seats in large measure because of the prominence they gained in 1974 as important members of the House Judiciary Committee in its Nixon impeachment inquiry Mr Sarbanes was designated to present the main evidence against Mr Nixon in the dramatic televised proceedings Mr Cohen was the first Republican to advocate Mr Nixons impeachment That background was one reason they were named to the Irancontra panel However to the disappointment of some of their supporters they have not been particularly active so far in the current investigation If they fail to live up to high expectations it could prove damaging to their careers Representatives Jim Courter Michael DeWine and Bill McCollum These three young Republicans on the investigative committee are little known outside their own districts in New Jersey Ohio and Florida respectively But because they are ambitious politicians and do not have the other legislative responsibilities of their more senior colleagues the three men have spent a lot of time on the Irancontra case According to some staff members they know the facts of it better than any other committee members except for the chairmen and ranking Republicans on the panels Mr DeWine has been given the plum assignment of conducting a large part of the interrogation of Richard V Secord the retired Air Force major general who will be the opening witness at the hearings If they seize the opportunity this could be their chance to set themselves apart from the pack of other junior legislators
CHICAGO CARDINAL SANCTIONS DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/04/us/chicago-cardinal-sanctions-dissent.html,Choosing careful but conciliatory words Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago said last week that couples who have been unable to have children must make their own decisions after prayer and reflection on the new Vatican doctrine opposing artificial fertilization In a speech last Wednesday to doctors and medical ethicists at the University of Chicago Hospital Cardinal Bernardin said he knew that many Roman Catholics would reject the Vatican document which condemns artificial fertilization as illicit Though Catholics are supposed to obey the doctrine the Vatican did not spell out clearly whether violating it would be considered sinful In his remarks Cardinal Bernardin the leader of the 23 million Roman Catholics here did not disagree with the Instruction a form of Vatican document that summarizes church teaching but does not carry the moral weight of a Papal encyclical But he said he has heard personally the pain of couples who yearn for the birth of a child Wrong but Perhaps Not Sinful We must offer them love support and understanding he said And in the end after prayerful and conscientious reflection on this teaching they must make their own decisions While the Instruction holds artificial insemination and other forms of reproductive technology to be morally wrong theologians said couples who rejected it would not necessarily be guilty of sin as they would if they flouted church prohibitions against contraception and abortion Cardinal Bernardin defended the Vatican teaching released in March saying that in vitro fertilization violates church morality by separating the act of intercourse from procreation Moreover he said such scientific advances could encourage couples to plan for a genetically perfect child and reject the birth of a child that would be less than ideal If we are not comfortable with turning the creation of human life into an impersonal or pick and choose process what principles exist to restrain such activities he told a conference sponsored by the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics Continuing Study and Dialogue But he suggested that the church is still examining its response to new medical technology saying that matters as complex as this require continuing study and dialogue He continued I do not believe that history will judge this Instruction to be in the same category as the churchs response to Galileo who was imprisoned by the Inquisition in the 17th century for publishing a scientific paper declaring that the earth revolves around the sun My greater concern Cardinal Bernardin said is that the Instruction will be rejected out of hand simply because it dares to assert that there are some normative principles that should guide medical advances in fertility technology Medical ethicists and some Catholic theologians said the Cardinals remarks seemed intended to strike a note of conciliation among those Catholics and others who viewed the Vatican document on human reproduction as harsh and legalistic Teaching Called Fragile The Rev Richard A McCormick one of the nations leading Catholic authorities on biomedical ethics said the Cardinals remarks seemed to take into account the widespread disagreement with the Vatican document among clergy and laity in the American church The Cardinal was in his own way acknowledging the fragility of the teaching said Father McCormick a professor at the University of Notre Dame and an outspoken critic of the Vatican document He can work within the system Thats his genius The director of the in vitro fertilization program at the University of Chicago Dr James Schreiber said many doctors share the Cardinals concerns about technologically advanced methods of human reproduction such as surrogate motherhood and experiments that seek to alter life forms by recombining the components of DNA But the crux of the matter here and where we part is whether we are creating new life he said In vitro fertilization creates new life no more no less than tubal ligation which allows the sperm and the egg to get together And if were going to stop this then we should go back and stop all the old technologies

POPE LEAVES AS GERMANS PONDER PAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/05/world/pope-leaves-as-germans-ponder-past.html,Pope John Paul II ended a fiveday tour of West Germany today by celebrating an ecumenical service with other Christian leaders But the meaning of the visit by Vatican admission was not so much to increase understanding between Christian faiths as to underline the lessons Roman Catholics in Germany could draw from the history of their church during the Third Reich In Cologne and Munich the Pope beatified a convert from Judaism Edith Stein who became a Carmelite nun and the Rev Rupert Mayer a Jesuit who both suffered at the hands of the Nazis Beatification is the final step before sainthood In Munster to the north the Pope paid homage to Clemens August Cardinal Graf von Galen known as the Lion of Munster one of the few Catholic prelates known to have actively resisted Nazi rule Enhancing Moral Authority Again and again John Paul named Catholics  churchmen like Cardinal von Galen or labor leaders like Nikolaus Gross who was executed in Berlin in 1945  for their resistance to Hitler The idea behind the Popes remarks was not just academic history but also an effort to enhance the churchs moral authority The implication was that Catholic leaders had resisted Nazi atrocities and that today the church continued to oppose violations of life and human rights John Paul repeatedly compared euthanasia under Nazism to abortion and mercy killing as practiced now and condemned both with equal vehemence A second message was political Perhaps with an eye to Eastern Europe and his Polish homeland the Pope insisted that neglect of God must lead to disregard for human rights It was a delicate task Some asked if the Catholic bishops who helped to craft the Popes remarks were trying to rewrite the history of the period and asserted that there had been little opposition to Nazism among Catholic leaders except to defend traditional Catholic prerogatives Period of Reassessment Germany is caught up in a general reassessment of the Nazi period that has prompted some to conclude that the time is perhaps right to lift from young Germans the weight of their elders sins Chancellor Helmut Kohl who met with the Pope today in Speyer on the Rhine likes to boast that having been too young to serve in World War II he is the first postwar German leader not to bear the onus of the Nazi era The role of the Catholic Church under Nazism has been the subject of particularly sharp historical dispute John Pauls task was not made easier by the German bishops choice of candidates for beatification Edith Stein who became Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce was killed by poison gas at Auschwitz in 1942 She was beatified as a Christian martyr even though Jews familiar with her life including relatives maintain that she was killed because of her Jewish background Father Mayer who was imprisoned three times for resisting Nazi rule was saved from a worse fate only after church leaders struck a deal with Nazi officials to intern him in a Benedictine monastery The Guardian a British weekly newspaper compared John Pauls efforts with the visit of President Reagan to the cemetery at Bitburg with its graves of SS members which was widely criticized as suggesting the rehabilitation of war criminals An Italian newspaper Il Messaggero said the problem lay not so much with what John Paul said in Germany as what he did not say Praise for those who resisted Nazism would have been more convincing the newspaper said if it had been accompanied by a profound apology for the Catholic hierarchys failure to speak out against Nazi barbarism John Paul reportedly acknowledged privately to Jewish leaders he met in Cologne on Friday that the church hierarchy had indeed done too little to resist Nazism But nowhere did he repeat the acknowledgment publicly
ABORTION BOMBINGS SUSPECT: A PORTRAIT OF PIETY AND RAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/nyregion/abortion-bombings-suspect-a-portrait-of-piety-and-rage.html,By the time the bomb squad burst into the Manhattan headquarters of Planned Parenthood last Dec 14 the carpet was on fire and the air clouded by smoke In the waiting room for abortion patients the officers discovered the remains of an exploded incendiary device and a fullscale bomb capable of being ignited at any moment by the heat When an officer deftly snipped the wires the threat was over and the investigation was about to begin With 15 sticks of dynamite the bomb was powerful enough to have collapsed the front of the building at 380 Second Avenue and to have shattered windows onequarter mile away With a blasting cap timer and battery the bomb showed its architect to be someone of sophistication And one last component nestled amid the sticks of dynamite caught the officerss eyes a medal of St Benedict A Cardinals Appeal The dynamite and the medal ultimately led to Dennis John Malvasi In late February 1987 with 300 Federal agents and city detectives drawing closer Mr Malvasi surrendered to face charges of bombing four abortion clinics in the city But the law alone had not convinced Mr Malvasi to give up It had been a televised appeal by John Cardinal OConnor So concluded an urgent manhunt and so emerged the story of Mr Malvasi  victim and victimizer criminal and patriot religious zealot and master dissembler Mr Malvasis path coursed through orphanage and battlefield theater and shrine prison and ocean liner Along the way he developed disguises and mail drops and aliases Dennis Staddon the mailroom clerk Dennis Staniloff the car owner Robert Becht the paramedic and Albert Alfano the actor and licensed pyrotechnician Now Mr Malvasi is No 13742054 in the Metropolitan Correctional Center held without bail on an 11count indictment that could bring him 90 years in prison He has pleaded not guilty but is said by friends to be considering a plea bargain The four abortionclinic bombings of which he stands accused are the only such attacks in New York City history They are among the most severe of the 59 cases recorded nationally since 1982 Federal agents say because they were not the work of an amateur with gasoline and matches as is the usual scenario but of a professional capable of locating and assembling high explosives Mr Malvasis case then opens a window on the most extreme elements of the antiabortion movement where the mixture of piety and rage endangers life in the name of saving it It also offers a glimpse into the fraternity of Vietnam combat veterans the majority who settled into homes and families the handful who still live on the margins of society Should Mr Malvasi come to trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan as scheduled on June 29 his defense is expected to hinge on whether his wartime experience warped him to the point of insanity What is already apparent is that when Mr Malvasi speaks of abortion he frames it in military terms History will show that abortion in New York State was nothing more than the dissipation of the black and Puerto Rican populace he said in an interview for this article Thats where most of the kills were In Vietnam parlance dissipate is the verb for kill and kill the noun for fatality Or as Mr Malvasi once put it to a friend who shared both his combat experience and his fervent faith And when I came back from Vietnam they called me a babykiller Dennis John Malvasi was born Jan 18 1950 the seventh child of a woman who first gave birth at the age of 15 and eventually had 12 children by at least 3 different men His mother Jenny Malvasi placed most of her children in the St Joseph Home a Catholic orphanage in Peekskill NY There Dennis lived for 12 of his first 14 years until Mrs Malvasi brought him to her home in the East New York section of Brooklyn The neighborhood abruptly shifting from white to black and working class to slum was a cauldron of race hate To come to East New York from a home run by Christians was a shock Mr Malvasi said I constantly caught beatings from black people for no reason The whites used to beat me up too because they thought I was Puerto Rican The whole neighborhood was brutal Then he saw escape in the form of a Marine from the neighborhood hard and proud in his dress blues Mr Malvasi went to a Marine recruiting station in Times Square to enlist Advised that because he was 17 he needed a parents consent he paid a passerby 20 to sign as his mother I Felt Really Alive The 27th Marines Mr Malvasis regiment was deposited into the vicious aftermath of the Tet Offensive In the regiments first full month of combat the 27th conducted 505 patrols 214 ambushes and 8 large sweepandclear operations around Da Nang Mr Malvasi himself was a bullseye the bullets never found As a field radio operator he always took heavy fire because he provided the single link to air support or evacuation aid and because his position was betrayed by the antenna protruding from his bunker He both feared and savored the role One part of Mr Malvasi was afraid almost certain that Id never see America again Another part however enjoyed a perverse pleasure I felt really alive really wanted The baddest people I knew were in front and they came shooting at me I felt kind of honored An Escape Actor Is Born Shortly after his discharge in May 1970 Mr Malvasi answered an advertisement for acting workshops and appeared at a storefront on the Lower East Side There he met Linda Mussmann his Pygmalion She was an Indiana farm girl with long hippie hair and enough naivete to open a theater on Avenue A in the midst of the East Village heroin epidemic He was a street punk with an untapped dramatic brilliance The eighth grade dropout auditioned with a scene from Waiting for Godot and cured himself of his Brooklyn accent by mimicing the directors prairieflat tones He went on to act in full productions of Shaw Ibsen Pinter and Ionesco There was an honesty about him that was extraordinary and an ability to take big chances Ms Mussmann said There was a vulnerability and an openness The guy was a genius The stage appealed to Mr Malvasi for some unorthodox reasons It kept me in balance he said I was hanging around with some very dangerous people in Brooklyn and then I was with these actors and neither knew about the other I could walk on the wild side and then go into the theater like I was civilized Then the membrane separating Mr Malvasis two worlds began to dissolve Charged in Stabbing In September 1972 Mr Malvasi was arrested after both stabbing and being stabbed by a man in a traffic altercation He pleaded guilty to seconddegree assault a felony and was sentenced to five years probation The following year Mr Malvasi was jumped by three men on his way home from a rehearsal and severely stabbed When he returned to the streets it was with a gun He made no secret of it to anyone except his probation officer In November 1975 two months after being released early from probation Mr Malvasi was arrested again for carrying a loaded 25caliber pistol Convicted on a reduced charge of attempted criminal possession of a weapon his second felony Mr Malvasi entered the Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock for two years A gladiator school he now calls it While in jail Mr Malvasi wrote several letters that his friends say were rare for the open anguish they revealed One was a plea to Governor Hugh L Carey for clemency contrasting his own incarceration to the amnesty offered to Vietnam War draft evaders Several others were sent to Linda Mussmann Although Mr Malvasi wrote about the present she said he dated the letters in 1968 and 1969 the years he had spent in Vietnam Prison was excruciating to him almost impossible to survive Ms Mussmann said He thought of it as a kind of war And he was lucky enough  or unlucky enough  to survive A Brotherhood Of Veterans To the members of the fledgling Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company the newcomer named Dennis Malvasi was just another guy getting his life back together In what these men saw as an insensitive nation they would heal one another So many of us had grim stories one more didnt surprise us said Bill Cooner who acted with Mr Malvasi We were a brotherhood At Vetco as the theater company is known Mr Malvasi won people over with the same hard work and enthusiasm Ms Mussmann had known He acted in Botticelli and Bury the Dead among other plays and he served as a fulltime technical supervisor for about nine months An eager beaver recalled Tom Bird Vetcos artistic director Offstage Mr Malvasi earned a reputation for intense loyalty to his fellow veterans He got Mr Cooner a job in the same mailroom where he worked After 15 years apart he recognized his Marine comrade Josh Cruz in a subway station and introduced the aspiring actor to Vetco Then he arranged a reunion of their mutual friends to see Mr Cruz starring in the acclaimed Vetco drama Tracers A Variety of Names At the same time most of Mr Malvasis friends noticed some quirks Solicitous of others he shielded his own private life When it came to discussing Vietnam his attitude ranged from indifference to sarcasm War is war was a typically stoic comment Then there were the names After his first show at Vetco Mr Malvasi changed his stage name to Albert Alfano and later John Staddon He worked in a mailroom as Dennis Staddon His drivers license was for Dennis Staniloff For lack of a better explanation friends attributed it to an actors eccentricity A few did know that Mr Malvasi was in Mr Cooners phrase extralegal  not in big ways more as a challenge to the system Once Mr Malvasi had to pay off a series of parking tickets to renew his drivers license He drew a money order for the licensing fee but deliberately wrote a bad check for the tickets Caught Buying Guns I said Theyre going to come after you for grand larceny Ray Robertson of Vetco recalled And he said Yeah but they wont take away my license Mr Malvasis extralegal activities turned far more serious in May 1984 Between acting stints on a cruise ship based in Tampa Mr Malvasi drove to Fort Lauderdale where a friend from his second tour in Vietnam had settled He wanted to see the mans newborn child and while he was in the vicinity to buy some guns With a drivers license for Dennis John Staddon Mr Malvasi ordered 20 25caliber Raven pistols from Family Firearms in nearby Margate The clerk alerted the Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms When Mr Malvasi and the friend returned to pick up the guns an undercover agent was behind the counter On March 13 1985 a grand jury in Federal District Court in Miami indicted Mr Malvasi on six weapons felonies and issued a warrant for his arrest For the first time he was a fugitive Stuff like that doesnt bother me Mr Malvasi said Actually I dont feel good unless I have someone hunting me down I like knowing that people are concerned about by whereabouts It makes me feel alive It makes me feel wanted New Interest Catholic Cult In his furtive new life Mr Malvasi received telephone calls by beeper collected his mail at several bars and lived out of a sea bag One of the friends who put him up from time to time was Edmund H Janiszewski a Vietnam combat veteran with a full disability for mental stress that he says was caused by wartime exposure to toxic herbicides While most friends did not know of Mr Malvasis strong and conservative Catholicism Mr Janiszewski shared it He also introduced Mr Malvasi to Our Lady of the Roses a renegade movement led by Veronica Lueken a Long Island housewife who claims that the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ appear to and speak through her The Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn has investigated her claims declared them groundless and denounced the movement Nonetheless Mrs Lueken has an estimated 60000 followers in NorthAmerica They apparently respond to her contentions that for instance Satan attended the Second Vatican Council and Pope Paul VI was kidnapped drugged and replaced by an impostor for the last six years of his reign Spiritual Messages And abortion Mrs Leuken has frequently said is the foulest of sacrileges In May 1986 she told a crowd that Jesus was saying to her We cannot tolerate the murders of the unborn This is a sacrilege of the most foul manner in the eyes of the Eternal Father and shall be punishable by death Federal agents found that for several years the movements faithful have picketed the Eastern Womens Center at 38 East 30th Street in Manhattan one of the abortion clinics Mr Malvasi is accused of having bombed They also learned that the movement sells medals of St Benedict similar to the one found with the dynamite at Planned Parenthood A man who identified himself only as George and said he answering inquiries on Mrs Leukens instructions was asked if her call for the death of abortionists might easily be taken literally All these messages are meant spiritually George said But were aware that people might not capture the point of the message Mr Janiszewski said Mr Malvasis outrage about abortion arose from at least one additional source During his months as a fugitive Mr Malvasi studied for his paramedics license and one night he brought a textbook to Mr Janiszewskis apartment I remember him opening the book to the part on assisting in childbirth Mr Janiszewski said He said Heres the truth Look This is a life And then he said how all of us combat vets were called babykillers 4 Bombings And a Manhunt On Dec 10 1985 a tube packed with explosive powder burst into flame in the unoccupied mens bathroom of the Manhattan Womens Medical Center 115 East 23d Street It was the first attack on an abortion clinic in New York City history At 135 AM on Oct 29 1986 a bomb with a halfstick of dynamite exploded at the Eastern Womens Center blowing out the windows and blasting a hole in the wall Just two weeks later on Nov 11 an anonymous caller directed the police to an unexploded bomb with three sticks of dynamite hidden inside a sofa at the Queens Womens Medical Office 8306 Queens Boulevard Then on Dec 14 police officers defused the bomb in Planned Parenthoods offices at 380 Second Avenue at East 22d Street And in it of course they found the dynamite and the religious medal Three hundred Federal agents and city detectives were now on the case working around the clock for weeks We were concerned because the bomber was changing his signature with each bombing said Robert Creighton special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms More powerful and more complex Designed so he could get away and designed to do damage Dynamite Is Traced Relying on several witnesses to the bombings Federal agents created a composite sketch of a suspect Then they compared it to the 6000 photographs of every licensed pyrotechnician in New York and Pennsylvania There they located Albert Alfano And Albert Alfano pointed to Dennis Malvasi The agents traced the unexploded dynamite to Harveys Lake Pa near WilkesBarre They arrested Carl Cenera Donald Pryor Jr and Frank Wright  Mr Malvasis former brotherinlaw  for supplying the felon with dynamite and not recording the sale In recent court hearings all three pleaded guilty and described how Mr Malvasi visited Mr Wright in September 1986 looking for dynamite In a local bar Mr Malvasi approached Mr Cenera who is licensed to sell explosives Mr Cenera declined Then Mr Pryor a Green Beret who left Vietnam with a Silver Star for valor and a full disability for posttraumatic stress syndrome entered After becoming fast friends over war stories according to court proceedings Mr Malvasi said he needed dynamite to deal with some Viet Cong in New York Mr Pryor arranged the sale of 45 sticks the following night Evading Traps As for Mr Malvasi he narrowly evaded Federal agents several times He sniffed out the ruse when one agent posing as a Hollywood producer invited him to audition for a movie about Vietnam Another time Mr Malvasis boss at Radio City Music Hall where he was a staff paramedic telephoned him to come in for an unscheduled rehearsal for a show with only two days to run The fugitive suspicious called back He identified himself as an inspector with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and asked if his agents were still there At the word yes he hung up A few weeks later on Feb 23 Cardinal OConnor made his televised plea The next day Mr Malvasi surrendered He still had the accoutrements of life on the lam an eyepatch and sunglasses for disguise a toothbrush and razor for convenience But why had he stopped running Cardinal OConnor is a prince of the church Mr Malvasi said from prison recently If the Cardinal says something and you dont listen then when you stand before the magistrate in the celestial court you got problems And I got enough problems without God being mad at me
Black Group Calls Police Job Screening Prejudiced,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/nyregion/black-group-calls-police-job-screening-prejudiced.html,An association of black police officers said yesterday that the New York City Police Department discriminated against female and minoritygroup applicants In a report the group the National Black Police Association asserted that black and Hispanic candidates for jobs as officers had been discriminated against in psychological tests and character investigations given by the department The group called on the department to reconsider the applications of minoritygroup candidates rejected since 1979 the year in which the testing was started for all the uniformed police forces  housing transit and the city force The report was issued after an 18month study by a commission of inquiry appointed by the association and another black police group the Grand Council of the Guardians Panel members interviewed minoritygroup candidates for Police Department positions and analyzed hiring data for the last eight years An author of the report Dr Gerald Horne former director of the National Conference of Black Lawyers called the screening often inaccurate and unsavory and urged significant reform if not outright abolition of the psychologicalservices unit The department Chief of Personnel Anthony M Voelker rejected the criticisms He called the screening very fair Chief Voelker said that the issue of fairness in hiring particularly in psychological testing and character examination had been raised from time to time but that the system has sufficient safeguards built into it Citing a recent entrance examination Alton R Waldon a former Representative from Queens and a member of the commission said that although 823 percent of the white candidates had passed the psychological examination 721 percent of the blacks had cleared the hurdle The test is given solely to applicants who have passed a written general examination Mr Waldon described the results as typical of other tests given since 1979 He said In the character assessments we found the grossest mistreatment of blacks and Hispanics Mr Waldon complained that process was fraught with institutionalized racism Applicants are given a battery of written psychological examinations followed by an interview with one of 20 staff psychologists according to Chief Voelker He said if a candidate was rejected for psychological reasons at that stage his case could be reviewed by a panel of two psychologists including one from outside of the department Finally according to the Chief a candidate can appeal the rejection to the City Civil Service Commission Commenting on the report Chief Voelker said Blacks pass the psychological test at about 90 percent the white rate However he maintained Ethnicity does not enter into the process At a news conference yesterday at the Borough of Manhattan Community College the authors of the report cited examples of discrimination against black Hispanic and female applicants The examples ranged from the reported rejection of a black candidate because he was the child of a racially mixed marriage to the case of a female applicant who said she had been rejected by an interviewer because she had had an abortion Police spokesmen denied candidates could be rejected for such personal reasons But Chief Voelker said an applicants medical history including any abortions would be included in a candidates file The renewed criticisms are made at a time Commissioner Benjamin Ward has urged blacks to apply in greater numbers for jobs The authors of the report applauded recent recruitment efforts including posters featuring prominent black members of the clergy as extremely positive Mr Waldon however said the drive should be seen only as a first step that must be followed by new approaches to screening
WASHINGTON TALK: THE BIBLE ON CAPITOL HILL; Lawmakers Study the Lawgivers,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/us/washington-talk-the-bible-on-capitol-hill-lawmakers-study-the-lawgivers.html,Moses and the Israelites were half way across the Red Sea on their flight from Egypt when the bell pealed long and loud through the Hart Office building signaling a vote on the Senate floor Slamming shut their Bibles four Senators dashed for the door For the moment the Old Testament account of the Exodus from Egypt to the Promised Land was put on hold In this group youre never sure who is going to show up or how long they are going to stay and then the bell goes off and they all disappear Barbara Levin observed as she sat alone in a circle of chairs that had been pulled together for a weekly Bible study group Each Wednesday at 5 oclock the group convenes in the office of Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania Regulars in addition to Mr Specter include Senators Larry Pressler of South Dakota Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio Mrs Levin the wife of Senator Carl Levin of Michigan often joins the group as does Shirley Metzenbaum the Ohio Senators wife Timeless Issues Led by Naomi Rosenblatt a Washington psychotherapist and student of the Old Testament who conducts a number of similar groups in her home the members question and explore the timeless issues raised by the ancient text One Wednesday the Senators were collegially disputatious as they probed challenged interpreted and questioned passages from the Book of Exodus Chapters 7 through 12 What does it tell us about the process of negotiation Mrs Rosenblatt asked How the hell do you get Pharaoh to let your people go What is the lesson It strikes me said Senator Durenberger that the lesson is that no one who has power is going to give it up until he is convinced he has met another invincible power For the Senators the weekly hour is a respite from the grind and pressures of the legislative week as well as an opportunity to find a framework for such issues as abortion capital punishment genetic engineering and sanctioned school prayer Im offended by public officials who make too much of their religious piety said Senator Pressler But personally these sessions mean a lot to me I find it a peaceful thing to do he added to sit down in a group like this and talk about ideas about some of the struggles that mankind has faced before Theirs is just one of the several groups that gather on Capitol Hill to address religious and philosophical concerns A prayer breakfast is held at 8 AM each Wednesday in both the House and the Senate a number of other legislators meet for private prayer and discussion These gatherings are all voluntary unofficial and for the most part unpublicized Some meet at noon said Dr David Ford chaplain at the House of Representatives but they tend to move about and its hard to keep track of them Members of the various groups treasure their privacy said Dr Richard C Halverson who has served as Senate chaplain for six years Like faith everywhere else he said I think there has been a growing movement here just as there has in the rest of the country but the Senate Prayer Breakfast is an institution that goes back to the early 1940s The Senate Prayer Breakfast a group that can range from a dozen participants to several dozen is currently coordinated by Senator Lawton Chiles Democrat of Florida and is led each week by a different legislator It is a cross between a lecture and a sermon with each Senator taking a turn Senator Specter said Weve had everything from a philosophical talk about death to the moral and ethical issues of surrogate mothers It was Senator Specter who has known Naomi Rosenblatt and her husband Peter a Washington lawyer since law school days who approached Mrs Rosenblatt two years ago about the possibility of traveling to Capitol Hill each week to lead a discussion group on the Old Testament Over the months weve had a good number of senators attend off and on but we are the nucleus Senator Specter said The core members cut across the political and religious spectrums Senators Durenberger and Pressler both Republicans come from Catholic backgrounds while Senator Specter a Republican and Senator Metzenbaum a Democrat share the Jewish faith Its like being back in kindergarten again Senator Durenberger said Everyone is learning and no one is smarter than anyone else A Discussion About Power Last year the participants spent several weeks focusing on the reign of King David discussing power the responsibility it demands the abuse it invites All of those things come through very succinctly in the story of David Mrs Rosenblatt pointed out The Old Testament is written in such a way that it is open to infinite interpretations she said That is why it is so vital and valid today It deals with human nature and there is enough ambiguity there that thousands of years later when we have evolved into a different animal it is still applicable The weekly sessions have also taught the Senators some lessons about one another At times Senator Specter said the participants still feel somewhat selfconscious about talking so introspectively and personally These are very private very personal things he said

FOSTER AGENCIES LOSE A DECISION OVER ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/08/nyregion/foster-agencies-lose-a-decision-over-abortions.html,A Federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that all fostercare agencies that do business with New York City including the Roman Catholic Church must begin to provide contraception and abortion services in group foster homes on July 1 The judge Robert J Ward of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied a request by the Archdiocese of New York and other fostercare providers that sought to postpone the implementing of the order while the issue was being tested in the higher courts The decision threw into question the future of the citys already troubled fostercare system John Cardinal OConnor the head of the archdiocese has said repeatedly that he would withdraw 2500 beds from the system if forced to provide the familyplanning services He has said such a withdrawal would be made gradually to give the city time to assume responsibility for the children involved A spokesman for the archdiocese Joseph Zwilling said yesterday Basically our position has not changed Marcia Robinson Lowry the director of the Childrens Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union said The confrontation the agencies were threatening in their court papers is soon going to be upon us CrisisRidden System In court papers requesting the postponement the language was already heating up Dr Jerome Goldsmith executive director of the Jewish Board of Family and Childrens Services warned that the withdrawal of the religious agencies would worsen an already crisisridden system In her affidavit Ms Lowry responded Such an argument amounts to little more than blackmail and should not be dignified by this court The familyplanning requirement is the result of a suit brought 14 years ago by the ACLU that seeks to provide similar levels of service for all children in foster care regardless of which agency provides the service under contract with the city In a settlement of the suit approved in February the ACLU and the city agreed to make broad changes in the delivery of services But many of the religious agencies that contract with the city objected to the settlement A spokeswoman for the Human Resources Administration Suzanne Trazoff said the city agency had supported the postponement of the order on family planning but she added that as always we are making plans to insure an orderly transfer if it comes to that The city has said it would assume control over the archdioceses fostercare beds should it withdraw Other Problems City officials had been hoping that a confrontation on the issue could have been avoided by a postponement In the interim they expected to continue under existing contracts while the State Court of Appeals reviewed the settlement of the ACLU lawsuit While the Catholic agencies objected to the familyplanning provisions Jewish agencies had other problems with the settlement Under its provisions the Jewish agencies would not be able to give preference to Jewish children in the fostercare system Instead children would be assigned to agencies on a first come first served basis The Jewish agencies have joined the Catholics in appealing the settlement
How Right-to-Lifers Promote Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/09/opinion/how-right-to-lifers-promote-abortion.html,In July 1986 the worlds population which didnt top a billion until 1850 passed the five billion mark The Population Institute a publicinterest group that seeks a better balance between population and world resources warns that the five billion may be ten billion by 2028 All the more reason to lament the Reagan Administrations abandonment of family planning overseas out of misguided obeisance to the right to life movement For many years the United States was the largest contributor to population control programs abroad But in 1984 the Administration started cutting off aid to any international agencies that condoned abortion As a result Washington no longer supports International Planned Parenthood even though the organization has never used American grants for abortion programs Nor does the United States support the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  because it helps the Chinese whom the Reagan Administration disbelieves when they deny coercing abortions The cuts came just as developing countries had finally taken Americas message to heart The Government of Bangladesh wants desperately to reduce population growth Yet for lack of family planning programs scarcely 20 percent of Bangladesh couples practice contraception The President of Kenya where the average woman has eight children has spoken of the threat to living standards posed by its high birth rate Of the anticipated world population growth 91 percent will take place in countries that cant now feed their people  and whose natural resources have already been degraded In Ethiopia the need for fuel wood has turned the countrys forests into desert Mexico City can look forward to 26 million residents  and an even more poisonous atmosphere  by 2000 The noisy Americans who have successfully urged their views on the Administration would aggravate such problems for the sake of singleminded opposition to abortion Therein lies a painful paradox The one sure consequence of reduced family planning services will be a rise in abortions Witness Brazil Before it started to promote family planning 40 percent of the public health budget for obstetrics and gynecology was spent on women injured by illicit abortions Ethiopia showed Americans the face of famine Calcutta reveals the depths of poverty The reduced commitment to overseas family planning sets the scene for more famine poverty  and abortions
REAGAN'S BAND OF TRUE BELIEVERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/magazine/reagan-s-band-of-true-believers.html,SOON WE WILL know more about the Irancontra affair Witnesses before the special prosecutors grand jury and before the Congressional committees that began hearings last week will expose the operations in much greater detail They will delve into the underworld of arms dealers and financial brokers into which Lieut Col Oliver L North and his fellow National Security Council staff members descended They will tell of Manucher Ghorbanifar the main intermediary with the Iranians and the Scheherazade of polygraphs They will enumerate the secret arms deals and try to account for the millions of dollars gone astray on their way to the contras In the end we may discover what the President and his Director of Central Intelligence William J Casey knew and what they did But the Tower Commission report has already made the style of the operations quite clear  and it has given us important clues to the central question of how such a thing could have occurred From one perspective as a number of commentators have noted the affair could be seen as merely the latest in a series of attempts by American Presidents to concentrate power in the White House and to make their foreign policy independent of the Congress and the State Department Robert C McFarlane after all thought of his role in the Iran initiative as analagous to Henry A Kissingers in the secret negotiations with Beijing Yet seen from another angle the affair belonged to a pattern quite specific to the Reagan Administration It was not just a matter of the Presidents management style or the arrogance of those whose President had been reelected in a landslide It was a particular philosophy of government shared by many Reagan appointees a strain of homegrown radicalism that has deep roots in American history and that carries with it a disrespect for institutions and rules The radical strain had surfaced repeatedly in the struggles over domestic policy as well as in the conduct of foreign affairs The Irancontra affair merely exemplified it at its most extreme In the conclusion of its report the Tower Commission denounced all those involved in the operations for ignoring the constraints of orderly process and for failing to address significant questions of law In tone these Latinate phrases suited the commissions solemn purpose but contrasted sharply with the events described in its narrative  for the story is bizarre As the Tower report shows the atmosphere in the White House was quite different from that in the Nixon White House during the secret bombing of Cambodia and the Watergate breakin In the first place Reagan staff members were extraordinarily credulous Not only did they believe Ghorbanifars stories but they never even suspected that Iranian officials might be manipulating them rather than vice versa While the Nixon people knew their actions were illegal and did their best to conceal them Reagans men hardly seemed to have asked themselves where the statutory limits were They believed in what they were doing they believed in the authority of the President and that was that  even though what the President knew or remembered of their doings was often unclear to them In general they calculated little but felt a great deal Vice Adm John M Poindexter once accused North of getting emotional again but when the contra operation came to light he told Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff that he had done nothing about his suspicion that funds were being diverted because he was so damned mad at Tip ONeill To read the computertransmitted conversations between North Poindexter and McFarlane is to see that a certain strangeness had come over the group by 1986 Those involved were completely alienated from the rest of official Washington including the rest of the Reagan Administration They hated the libs as they called the liberal Democrats in Congress they despised the career CIA and they suspected all the NSC principals who were not involved North told the Iranians fantastic stories about the President In the end wearing himself out getting only two or three hours sleep a night North began to imagine the contras would win a great victory and that the President would go down in history for ending the IranIraq war McFarlane told North that North should be Secretary of State  and later that he should join him at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where the two would continue to work the Iran account as well as to build other clandestine capabilities so much in demand here and there BY 1986 THOSE INvolved in the Iran and contra operations were behaving rather less like nationalsecurity officials than like a bunch of Keystone Cops But there is a more precise analogy for what was happening among them a more apt parallel for the strange behavior of this small group of Government officials The analogy lies oddly enough in the sociology of contemporary religious cults The socalled cults after all New Age or Christian commonly have a charismatic father figure and enormous assets raised by contribution assets that have a tendency to disappear And those that are selfdestructing tend to go through a very particular form of group dynamics In such groups the process of unraveling begins when the charismatic father figure who once had much contact with his followers retreats within an inner circle of guardians and goes into silence What he does if anything is known only to a few intimates what he knows becomes a metaphysical or at least an epistemological problem Yet the ordinary members still believe that they have  on some level a direct personal relationship with the leader The problem is that they have no institutions or rules governing relations among themselves the group is an anarchy held together by his charisma Thus NSC staff members put together an ad hoc group drawn from various agencies with a shifting cast of characters and no clear lines of authority Since the father figure refuses to intervene even the smallest argument has the potential to explode and destroy the group To preserve itself the group projects its hostility onto outsiders and a wethey relationship develops in which group members come to believe that they are entirely good  indeed superior  beings while all outsiders are entirely bad inferior and untrustworthy Now the group cannot accept outside advice or criticism its members at the same time lose all normal skepticism about those who profess to support their cause  even those who look speak and act like crooks or con artists At some point the inner circle sensing hostility from the outer members withdraws into itself North once told McFarlane that Poindexters job was much harder than his since I only had to deal with our enemies He has to deal with the Cabinet Its members set themselves above the ordinary members and develop secret policies that are the very opposite of the stated policies of the group The more they develop and carry out their policies the more they lose touch with even that reality the ordinary members could give them Once exposed their activities appear to outsiders as quite mad  and possibly they are criminal The ordinary members express shock at the behavior of the inner circle But in fact all along they have sensed something strange going on within it and evidence of wrongdoing  such as a rattlesnake in the mailbox of an opponent has appeared in more or less plain sight The question is of course how this sort of dynamic could establish itself at the center of the United States Government READ THE EIGHTH Beatitude of Matthew 5 Colonel North told a reporter through the window of his truck the day after the Tower Commission report came out On the evening news Peter Jennings reported that the verse read Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven adding that the Tower Commission had chosen as one epigraph a quotation from the Roman satirist Juvenal Quis custodiet ipsos custodes Who shall guard the guardians The juxtaposition of the two quotations was pure poetry for the texts pointed to two very different views of human nature That Christian and classical texts should be invoked on either side of a political conflict in 1987 seems on the face of it extraordinary yet the texts pointed directly to an important aspect of the Irancontra affair  to the particular conflict fought out within the Reagan Administration In the United States the secular Roman tradition is embodied in the Constitution with its checks and balances and in the public architecture of Washington notably in the Capitol building More than in Europe where national traditions predate the Enlightenment secular rationalism is the foundation of the state and the law of the land The JudeoChristian tradition plays no parallel role in government yet one particular strain of it evangelical Protestantism has profoundly colored American civic culture It underlies the notion of American exceptionalism the idea of America as a redeemer nation a people charged with a divine mission in the world Beyond that it has been the engine for most socialreform movements on the left and on the right and it has sustained the idealistic even visionary quality in American life Abolitionism civil rights womens rights pacifism and internationalism have historically grown out of leftwing evangelical movements with their optimistic millenarianism Social conservatism nativism and jingoistic nationalism have grown out of conservative evangelical movements and pessimistic millenarianism Both millennial traditions look forward to an end to human history an end to politics and government In a sense the secular and the religious traditions cluster about the two names for the country the United States being the secular constituted Republic America being the organic mythic or moral land In the Reagan Administration this latter tradition was strong Arthur M Schlesinger Jr in his recent book The Cycles of American History proposes a regular cyclical alternation in American life between periods of concern for the public interest and periods where private interests come to the fore  the first bringing government controls and democratic reforms the second a relaxation of controls a greater role for the market and a retreat into private life This alternation he maintains is a natural systolicdiastolic movement While each phase normally brings a corrective to the one before both contain dangers for as too much government can stifle and restrict too much privatization invites corruption injustice even tyranny In Schlesingers terms the last six years represent a rightward swing of the pendulum a period of lower taxes and looser regulations and a period of some public apathy about injustice and the problems of the society But there was another element in the national mood one that was clearly reflected in the makeup of the Reagan coalition Arriving in Washington in 1981 with the new President were not just the genial Republican businessmen that such periods usually bring in but a great many people inflamed with a passionate desire for reform These people believed not simply that the government had become too big and too burdensome but that it had become a moral evil infecting American society Many believed the free market would create the promised land of milk and honey Yet outside the economic domain they believed fiercely in the importance of government not the government that existed but the one they themselves would create a government that would bring America back to morality and make it a tower of military might  a fortress invulnerable Many of these people commonly spoke of America and not of the United States and saw the country as a Babylon they would remake into a New Israel The movement conservatives as these people called themselves once the term New Right had aged were virtual strangers to Washington when they arrived in 1981 yet they had an ideological lineage as old as any extant party or movement in the United States  their antecedents lying in antiMasonry and in a certain nativist strain of Populism Even with all this history behind them however and with all their nostalgia for an earlier age they were not a conservative party in the usual sense for whether Catholics or Protestants they were intellectually speaking evangelicals Theologically and as a habit of thought evangelicals put the emphasis on direct experience rather than knowledge of doctrine or ritual practice the individual once born again becomes a regenerate being free of the past Evangelicism is thus by its nature antiintellectual ahistorical and wholly democratic It is also highly individualistic and disposed against institutions It focuses on the future and the quality of will or intention rather than on the record of past deeds good or bad The movement conservatives were thus temperamentally impatient and as pessimists of the right they looked forward to impending national destruction if they did not succeed What made them different from previous rightwing evangelical parties was their numbers and the great many activists brought to Washington on the Reagan tide In the 19th and early 20th centuries evangelical movements of the left and the right had appeared and disappeared many times  but without the temporal regularity of the Schlesingerian cycle They seemed to appear in times of profound economic change and social dislocation in times and in places where the old order was crumbling creating uncertainty insecurity and the need for new standards around which to organize life These reform movements appeared in a more or less secularized or ecumenical form in the 1960s  and then in the late 1970s Before 1980 however rightwing evangelical movements important as they were in the country made relatively small inroads into national politics In part it was that their largest constituency  white Southern Baptists  was politically immobilized for more than a century by the issues of slavery and segregation In part it was that until the late 1950s the economy of the South was that of an underdeveloped country compared to the North In the 1960s the civilrights movement freed pastors such as the Rev Jerry Falwell from their selfimposed silence In the 1970s the movement of new industries to the South and Southwest created the SunBelt phenomenon In this newly rich region freed by its affluence from the Democratic Party most voters had strong roots in conservative evangelicism As candidate in 1976 and in 1980 Ronald Reagan drew his strength from the new Republican Party of the Sun Belt and as President he brought a good many of its leaders to Washington This party included both movement conservatives and laissezfaire businessmen and the two had a good deal in common When it came to the threat of international Communism or the role of the Federal Government in domestic affairs men like Jesse Helms and Edwin Meese 3d saw eye to eye On these and other issues the movement conservatives found a variety of natural allies in Washington the sagebrush rebels on Federal land use the supplysiders on taxes the neoconservatives on the Soviet threat and conservative Catholics on abortion and aid to religious schools On each of these issues the movement conservatives and their temporary allies  people such as James G Watt in the Department of Interior William Bennett in the Department of Education and William Bradford Reynolds in the Justice Department  formed as it were a radical party in contradistinction to the traditional conservative party of men like Paul A Volcker George P Shultz and William E Brock Many of them held high positions in agencies throughout the Government  including those agencies they most wished to destroy But in matters of domestic policy the radicals experienced a good deal of frustration There were so many regulations so many statutes on the books and when they tried to hack away at them they were set upon by publicinterest groups They could trim their departments and deregulate as the conservatives saw fit but generally they could not go further for their strength lay in the Administration not on the Hill in Congress they lacked the votes to change the laws as they wished In frustration some of them took actions which liberals and conservatives construed as lawbreaking The Environmental Protection Agency for example suspended most hazardouswaste regulations the Justice Department ignored or defied civilrights legislation the Department of Health and Human Services dropped thousands of people from the Social Security disabilityinsurance rolls and adopted a policy of nonacquiescence when the action was judged illegal In practice the courts found these and a great many other such radical actions illegal At the same time and for reasons not unrelated an astonishing number of Reagan appointees had personal collisions with the law or the Ethics in Government Act There was a simple sleaze factor in the Administration that reflected the general laxity in fiduciary standards across the land in addition there was sleaze complicated by ideology Some of the radicals had after all grown up believing that all government regulations were unjust restrictions on their personal freedom others purely and simply felt that government was the enemy In the EPA scandals for example ideology was a factor  as it clearly was in the Irancontra affair While the radicals were constricted in the domestic arena they had more room for maneuver in foreign affairs where the executive held greater sway Here as they saw it their main impediments were the career diplomats and the bureaucrats at the CIA As it happened the primary passion of many movement conservatives was foreign and military policy This was true from the beginning  and even for many people best known for raising the social issues and injecting them into the 1980 campaign In the 1960s and 1970s Phyllis Schlafly for example wrote five books on nuclear strategy with a retired rear admiral  all designed to show that Robert S McNamara Paul H Nitze Henry Kissinger and their coconspirators at the Council on Foreign Relations were Soviet dupes plotting the unilateral disarmament of the United States In truth it was not precisely foreign policy that interested such people In his speeches the Reverend Falwell never used that word at all but spoke about Nicaragua and South Africa under the heading of defense policy This was no idiosyncrasy In the international arena rightwing evangelicals see politics not as the collision of differing selfinterests but as the expression of a transcendent power struggle between good and evil For them the enemy is a free agent not one caught up in history or confined by geography and local politics Thus on the global battlefield there can be no stable balance of power and no agreement to disagree the threat to national security is everywhere at once In foreign policy the movement conservatives found that President Reagan spoke their language In March 1981 the President described American aid to El Salvador as an attempt to try to halt the infiltration into the Americas by terrorists and by outside interference and those who arent just aiming at El Salvador but I think are aiming at the whole of Central America and possibly later South America  and Im sure eventually North America Actually the President was far more optimistic than most movement conservatives but he shared their nostalgia for a simpler time and their notion that international institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations were meaningless or even vehicles for some general conspiracy against America On most foreignpolicy issues the Administration was divided as it was in domestic affairs between traditional conservatives and radicals The divide was nowhere more explicit than in nuclear strategy and arms control While negotiators including indeed Paul Nitze  labored away at interminable arms talks in Geneva the radicals  such as Richard Perle  blocked all potential agreements in the conviction that the Russians could not be trusted and could not be dealt with until the United States had built up a commanding lead in nuclear weapons Surprising everyone the President took the radicals off the hook by proposing that the Strategic Defense Initiative would soon unfurl a vast invulnerable umbrella over the country thus rendering the arms talks moot Many did not actually credit his belief in this form of salvation from nuclear war until Reykjavik when he toyed with the idea that the abolition of ballistic missiles might be just as good WHEN THE IRAN initiative came to light and news reports indicated that some in the White House had seen it as a geopolitical gambit and some as an effort to free the hostages it was not hard to guess where the President stood Over the years Ronald Reagan had made it plain tht he conceived the world in terms of individuals He ended most speeches with a story about some one person a gallant lad who had saved someones life a Vietnamese refugee made good Baby Doe or a welfare cheat who bought vodka with food stamps As the Tower Commission discovered the President who had spent some time with the victims of the TWA hijacking of June 1985 asked his staff almost every day about the fate of the hostages and the plans to get them out What he thought about the political situation in Iran the IranIraq war and the problem of maintaining stability in the Middle East remains unclear even now As the White House focused on the hostages so it focused on two other categories of individuals the freedom fighters on one hand and the terrorists on the other For movement conservatives both groups were generic In a speech to a group in Nashville in May 1986 Colonel North who also ran the counterterrorism unit in the National Security Council linked both groups with a syllogism The Russians he maintained supported terrorists around the world from the IRA to Abu Nidal therefore the United States had to help the freedom fighters to go after the Soviet model in Nicaragua Quite possibly North and his fellow movement conservatives connected these two groups in metaphorical ways as well When they spoke of freedom fighters their vision was as North put it young men and women who have taken up the cause of democracy against a government that is cruelly repressive It was also perhaps a vision of guerrillas irregulars who went into the jungles into an area of freedom  freedom that is from civilization itself The terrorists did the same they were evil but they too lived beyond the law fighting governments indeed all civilized institutions The terrorists too were free What was more the cause of the freedom fighters and the cause of antiterrorism  like the cause of the hostages  permitted North and his associates to go beyond legal constraints and institutions into the same realm of freedom Ramboesque derringdo In fact the Rambo story could stand for both the Iran arms deal and the contra operation Rambo after all bucked the United States Government to go rescue his buddies from prison camps and torturers the lone warrior then came back from the jungle to take revenge on the bureaucrats who had so cynically left American soldiers to die The Rambo story is the same story of justifiable violent revenge against evildoers and the system that runs through so many American movies notably those starring Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood Rambo however is a narcissistic fantasy figure a largerthanlife hunk of gorgeous oiled muscles who performs impossible feats But then there seems to have been some element of narcissistic fantasy at work in both the Iran and the contra operations At the very least there was a certain solipsism THE RAMBO STORY and religious cult behavior both involve anarchic freedom from rules and responsibilities To use the cult model to help understand what happened in the Irancontra affair is to see that if those directly involved constituted an inner circle then the outer circle included not just other Administration officials but at some metaphorical remove a large part of the American public as well Those who now feel deluded or lied to had all the clues they needed When he was speaking to us the Great Communicator told us all about his particular world view More specifically by 1985 the news media and the intelligence committees in Congress had all the information they needed to start an investigation of Colonel Norths activities on behalf of the contras Here as elsewhere clues to the dark side of the Reagan Administration lay in plain sight Not only Reagans popularity but the enduring appeal of such movies as Rambo and Death Wish suggest that there is in the American psyche some deep sense that civilization is intolerably repressive These movies offer us fantasies in which our anarchic urges are fulfilled and go unpunished but the great American novels show us the reality of what we are about the reality is Gatsby Huck Finn and Clyde Griffiths it is also Ahab who creates his own enemy and pursues him to the death But happily that is not all there is The members of the Tower Commission chose their language well Their Latinate phrases signified that the Irancontra affair should end as a comedy in the classical tradition after a period of mayhem the social order is duly restored In his response to the report the President acquiesced promising to start a new life in which he would act responsibly and obey the rules After the hearings the Congress may adopt stricter legal constraints on the Presidency  or take other measures But the arrival of Frank Carlucci and Howard Baker in the White House signified that the Romans had already won
EATING DISORDERS GO BEYOND FOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/nyregion/eating-disorders-go-beyond-food.html,LEAD THE typical woman who has an eating disorder is not the good student from a perfect home as most studies have found according to recent findings Behind the facade of privilege are often traumas such as alcoholism divorce and learning disabilities according to Dr Diane Mickley an internist who founded the Wilkins Center for Eating Disorders in THE typical woman who has an eating disorder is not the good student from a perfect home as most studies have found according to recent findings Behind the facade of privilege are often traumas such as alcoholism divorce and learning disabilities according to Dr Diane Mickley an internist who founded the Wilkins Center for Eating Disorders in Greenwich An analysis of the records of 400 patients treated at the fiveyearold center for anorexia nervosa and bulimia through 1985 including 200 more during the past year found that 29 percent had alcoholic parents and that 20 percent had alcoholic tendencies themselves Ninetyeight percent were female with 90 percent under 30 years old threequarters of whom were between 18 and 24 years old Some patients described food binges much as they did a family members drinking binge Dr Mickley said The study dispelled a myth about sexuality and anorexics said Dr Mickley Although anorexics are frequently portrayed as avoiding dating situations 30 percent of those sexually active and not married reported the stressful experience of having a abortion said Dr Mickley who is also an attending physician at Greenwich Hospital They feared birth control pills would result in weight gains Women suffering from anorexia nervosa typically believe themselves to be heavier than they are and they starve themselves to achieve an ideal of thinness  which they never can achieve Bulimics are usually women of average weight or slightly above average weight who compulsively eat and then force themselves to vomit to try to discharge the food  and the calories that would make them gain weight In an anonymous questionnaire conducted by Cynthia Adams a psychologist and associate professor at the School of Allied Health Professions at the University of Connecticut at Storrs with her student Ellen Kasper 93 percent of the 60 University of Connecticut students and 130 high school students in South Windsor surveyed reported that they ate when they were not hungry Of that figure 80 percent said their eating was in binge proportions 60 percent said they binged on food twice a week High school students said boredom prompted their binges while college students said stress was to blame Asked how they felt after binging the response by both groups was strongly guilty One of the scariest things said Dr Adams was that only 20 percent of the 14 to 17yearolds have never dieted meaning 80 percent had Even more chilling is that 14 percent of those high school students reported starving until they had lost 25 percent or more of their original weight which is the primary part of the clinical definition of anorexia nervosa Regarding the 38 percent of high school students who reported that they exercised an hour each day to lose weight  regardless of how they felt  Dr Adams said I define that as hyper compulsive exercise Elise Harrison a family therapist at Fairfield University said the schools eatingdisorder group begun in 1983  no longer met Mrs Harrison said the reason was that the women with anorexia and those with bulimia could not identify with each others problems Those with anorexia stopped attending women with bulimia have been reluctant to join because they are afraid people will find out they have a problem she said Bulimics are very secretive Mrs Harrison said Theyre afraid theyll see someone they know Other treatment facilities in the state for eating disorders include the Newington Childrens Hospital YaleNew Haven Hospital and Silver Hill in New Canaan All offer inpatient programs The Wheeler Clinic in Plainville offers outpatient psychiatric services but refers patients to different places for medial help The Wilkins Center for Eating Disorders in Greenwich is a comprehensive outpatient center with a program of medical and psychiatric services and specializes solely in eating disorders Dr Mickley said Five years ago we felt very negative about the prognosis for cure Today we feel it requires time work skilled care and management but most people can completely recover You expect to see improvement of symptoms within three months to one year But to deal with all the issues may take many years Bulimics are unlike former alcoholics I dont believe once a bulimic always a bulimic that they walk a tightrope or might fall off the wagon We have some recovered patients who are now therapists There is a better understanding than there used to be of managing and addressing symptoms and incorporating that into therapy she said One of the things we understand is that the emotional aspect is not the prime object said Dr Mickley You cant ignore starving and binging while youre talking about emotional symptoms The symptom has a life of its own That behavior becomes entrenched You cant starve for five years while youre talking about the cause Starving and binging are buffers that distance you from the emotional issue Only when that symptom begins to recede do you get in touch with some of the important emotional issues The 10room center treats mostly women it has treated six men in the past year said Dr Mickley which represents about 3 percent of the patients The age range for men varies as it does for women most treated here are between 18 and 24 years old I help the patients choose therapists they can make a alliance with Dr Mickley said Some overweights participate in weightcontrol groups For anorexia and bulimia almost everyone gets individual therapy as well The center employs physicians psychiatrists psychologists social workers nutritionists and recovered patients One specialist is a psychological tester who does assessments another a psychopharmacologist is a psychiatrist who is an expert in medications A dietitian who once counseled models who were pregnant said her specialty was teaching people how to be healthy thin She helps clients learn about their food needs and the physiological consequences of starvation and binging She also explains problems that can surface during treatment including fluid retention and a large weight gain at the beginning of treatment We have to retrain the body as well as the mind said Dr Mickley It also helps to know that people have gone through this The center uses group therapy and medication to treat the patients Patients sometimes see a problem in others before they see it in themselves said Dr Mickley said of the value of group therapy But its not a substitute for individual therapy its an adjunct and part of a spectrum of services As for the medications used she said About 50 percent of women with bulimia are benefited by antidepressants which help some of the ancillary symptoms like being depressed unable to concentrate and not sleeping It also has some specific ability to reduce the urge to binge It doesnt cure or make you not binge but many tell us the medication makes these feelings less strong and more manageable

Mr Grays look at 20 years in the lives of a group of Cambridge University classmates was first staged in London and then in revised versions at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven the Matrix in Los Angeles and the Promenade Theater in New York where it is still playing Mr McGuire joined the production for the New York opening last fall London PreNew York  Michael McGuires phone call caught me at a bad time  very late in the evening when I was full of scotch grieving over the death of a beloved dog waiting anxiously to hear about the fate of my new play Melon and in the middle of watching The Cincinnati Kid on television He was concerned about how we would proceed in rehearsals How did codirectors actually work together he wondered I said one eye fixed on the screen one hand wrapped around the glass Well well just say whatever seems appropriate surely Well no he said hed been giving the matter a lot of thought and he was unutterably opposed to any system that led to our disagreeing openly in front of the cast theyd lose confidence not fair on them  But dont misunderstand me he also kept saying I dont have any ego problem with this play And I didnt say though I wanted to that I did have an ego problem with this play as it was by me Instead I babbled on incoherently sometimes drawing on experience so past I could scarcely remember it sometimes being or attempting to sound curtly professional cutting across his uncertainties with a slurred epigram But the truth is I knew he was right One can codirect one of ones own plays with one of ones old friends as Id just done in Dallas one could codirect while masquerading as the author as Id done so regularly before in the States but how when it came down to it did one codirect a major production in New York with an official codirector who clearly wanted to claim in advance his share of the responsibility  how in fact can one codirect with a codirector who wanted to codirect I refused to answer the question on the telephone at the time and as a consequence had to address myself to it again at a crucial phase of rehearsals in New York when I wasnt drunk anxious grieving or watching a film on televisionNew York Sept 9 Michael came over to the Lombardy Hotel at about seven We had a long conversation during the course of which I got drunk while he sat sipping water talking about his lack of an ego problem  with reference of course to our being codirectors  until drunker and therefore rasher I said that people who dont have an ego problem dont have to keep saying that they dont have an ego problem because the thing about an ego problem Michael is that it never occurs to you youve got one until youve got one and as soon as youve got one you spend your time denying that youve got one There was a long pause He admitted that he did in fact have an ego problem about our codirecting He was intensely worried about who was going to do what we must not contradict each other in front of the actors etc I became obstinate saying Listen Im codirector youre codirector were after all both grown up and both sort of human intelligent vulnerable If we make mistakes why pretend that we dont and why be embarrassed in front of actors if we have disagreements As we had to go uptown for our dinner with the cast the matter was left unconcludedSept 10 We worked through the first scene and the epilogue then ran them together Things seemed to be going quite well and Michael McGuire and I seemed to be developing a perfectly affable public relationship So perhaps weve finally found an ego solutionSept 12 The theater was immensely hot but everything went OK except for a minor discord between Michael McGuire and myself over the position of a chair which had been placed right beside the character Stuarts desk  theres also a chair behind the desk of course Stuart sat down behind the desk for the beginning of the very long 15minute conversation with Martin who immediately sat down beside the desk So there were the two of them at the desk together their elbows almost touching like elderly clubmen gossiping about the stock market or Xs divorce or Ys divorce or my divorce or your divorce I said something rather tetchy to Michael about the pointless tedium of the experience though I knew that what he was really doing was trying to learn about the text through having the actors chat their way through it He said he wanted to let the actors get to know each other I said that they would best do that by working through the scene properly Nevertheless we had a quite pleasant lunch together In the afternoon things went on in a dull achingly hot  it was so hot one could scarcely breathe  achingly hot way until Marigold Judy Geeson came on at the end of Act One to announce her abortion Whereupon Michael asked her what she felt about the abortion how the fact of the abortion would show itself in her sense of the scene etc I was almost beside myself with irritation I had been through this conversation not once endlessly in London not twice endlessly at the Long Wharf not three times endlessly in Los Angeles but now for the fourth time endlessly I got up  this was an hour before rehearsals were due to finish  swung my bag over my shoulder made some very blurred apologies to Michael and left the theaterSept 14 Michael shows his worry every time I intervene Actually I dont know quite how long we can go on like this or at what point I shall have to do something about it Thank God we have lots of time Otherwise we get on very well Michael and I Sept 17 Im waiting for Michael McGuire to turn up for what we call a showdown conversation Yesterday at 10 oclock there was meant to be a runthrough which I decided not to attend because it seemed more important to find a chiropractitioner my plan being to have my back fixed and get to the theater before the proper rehearsals  the real days work as far as I was concerned  began I had a particular reason for wanting to be punctual as Michael McGuire had phoned me on Monday evening to grill me about the function and intention of Act One Scene Two which struck me as odd  surely it would be much simpler for me to address the actors directly rather than going through him  until it further struck me that perhaps he didnt want me to address the actors Anyway some time in the late morning I phoned the theater to say that I hadnt been able to get hold of the chiropractitioner at least the one who had been recommended to me my back was extremely painful how far along were they in the runthrough what time roughly would rehearsals begin only to be told that they had been rehearsing all morning as the runthrough had been canceled  due to Judy Geeson not being well  and had been concentrating on Act One Scene Two I phoned up Jack McQuiggan the producer and said wed better talk to thrash out once and for all the codirector question We met in the hamburger joint around the corner from the Lombardy an appropriately seedy place where in films the cop gets his rakeoff or the stoolie his bullet between the eyes He told me that the actors were getting bewildered and fed up and wanted to know why I both as the author and with the experience of three productions behind him wasnt running the show I said I could see now that the codirecting idea had been a bad one at least as it was working out in practice In fact I found myself with the worst of both worlds unable to insinuate myself into the production as playwright and taking over the production as I was used to doing or operating effectively as codirector which was what I was billed as being The situation had to be turned around for the sake of the actors and the production and as quickly as possible  but with proper respect for Michael who was working hard and doing his best in an utterly false situation We cabbed to the theater to find Michael running Dylan Baker who was new to his role in his big scene at the end of Act One It was quite clear that they were both at sea Nevertheless Michael proposed that they simply run it again I suppose that he was trying to assimilate the scene through running it as often as possible picking up information through familiarity but it was a timeconsuming and energysapping not to say from Dylans point of view confidencesapping procedure especially as I felt I knew not only how the scene should work but how it could work differently with a different actor playing the role Dylan tried to object to running it again asking to be allowed to stop whenever he was in difficulty Michael said no dont stop I dont think we should stop lets run it They started the run and I sitting on the right of the stalls from Michael stopped the scene almost at once took Dylan back discussed the intention of the text started him again stopped him again every sentence or so In other words I took over the direction in a manner that was not only highhanded it was brutal cutting across Michael whenever he showed signs of speaking until he sat back impotent and no doubt humiliated everything made worse by the fact known to Michael but not until the end to me that a clutch of investors was sitting at the back of the stalls observing At the end Michael came over to me unable to hide his distress and said You excluded me Excluded me completely I said Well now you know what Ive been feeling all week He thought for a moment then nodded Yes he said I see that But now we have a real problem Whos going to direct Whos going to talk to the actors We arranged to meet tomorrow at 10 now in fact before rehearsals to answer this question after wed both had a chance to think it through but as far as Im concerned the question is answered It would not only be a nonsense but an irresponsible nonsense for me to let things go on as theyve been going on What makes it difficult for me though is that I know its my fault if I had acted decisively at the beginning instead of passively waiting for my temper to erupt and force me to take control all this misery could have been avoidedLate that night Michael came and we talked a long and painful conversation though its tone was civilized He quite agreed that his attempting to direct a play that he knows far less than I now seemed preposterous On the other hand he certainly hadnt understood that Jack has always intended him to be in a subsidiary role and if he had wasnt sure that he would have accepted the job I said that I felt it would only be subsidiary during the next stretch of rehearsals that once we were in the steady runthrough period and previews his eye his ear and his judgment would be invaluable He said his main problem would be how to deal with the actors They would be aware of what had happened  Kristoffer Tabori had already given him a look and he didnt think he could stand that sort of thing especially as years ago he had been a sort of uncle figure to Tabori I said that I didnt think hed get that sort of thing from any of the other actors and proposed that he should go in as usual and do anything he wanted in the first two hours but before he began he should say that I was going to come in later and do some very close work on the text of the sort that I had done yesterday with Dylan Baker Michael said that if I was going to take over he would prefer me to do it immediately which left me with the prospect of five hours rehearsals without a break  too much really given the pain of my back and the nature of the work  but I agreed which brought the conversation to an end As it turned out I only had enough stamina for three hours but they were three hours of intensely detailed work  the only sort of work I can do as a director  but then I dont think myself there is any other sort of work worth doing as everything from the specific physical moves to the general shape of a scene grows out of it I was absolutely exhausted by the end and as I didnt really get much sleep last night God knows how Im going to cope with tomorrows rehearsalsSept 20 Michael and I went and had a drink as is becoming our habit Michael wanted to talk again about his position in the production I strongly sympathize with his problem because at the moment he sits mute in rehearsals feeling functionless and unvalued I said I needed him both as companion and friend and as a highly intelligent and experienced man of the theater to whom I could turn for some kind of judgment  on this move or that move for instance or this line or that line  when I was at all uncertain I also said that I needed his opinions on how the actors were progressing and that he would certainly come into his own when we got to the preview stage Besides I said it seemed to me extremely important that he should be present at every phase of the process so that he would be in full possession of it for any future productions which he would be directing on his own  if he wants to and I hope he does because I know hell do them better than anyone else  but I had to do the next stretch on my own A final note Though these excerpts give I hope a coherent account of my experience of the most crucial exchanges in my relationship with Michael they necessarily omit anything I didnt know at the time  for example that Michael was as concerned as I was from the beginning about the falseness of his position and that his seeming tenacity during the opening weeks of rehearsal which I attributed so simply to an ego problem in fact came from a series of conversations with Jack McQuiggan from which he understood that he was performing the function asked of him and was expected to continue to do so Whether Jack intended to give him that understanding I dont know but suspect that caught between my seeming withdrawal and Michaels devoted activity had no choice but to wait until I did something to alter the equation What these excerpts also omit as the complete diaries of course do not is any account of the many intensely profitable  for me anyway  conversations we had about the progress of rehearsals His insights and considerate questionings became increasingly valuable as he became more and more familiar with the play particularly so as his sense of humor insured that he pointed to mistakes and potential dangers in the most palatable fashion By the time we were in previews our collaboration had established itself as happy and cheerful indeed at times riotous certainly the most successful Ive ever had in the American theater GRAY MATTER  Christopher Hampton the adapter of Les Liaisons

BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/books/books-of-the-times-182787.html,THE FORTUNE TELLER By Marsha Norman 387 pages Random House 1895 AT first the reader is inclined to notice similarities between Marsha Normans first novel and her Pulitzer Prizewinning play  Night Mother As in  Night Mother the action centers on the relationship between a mother and a daughter As in  Night Mother there is much talk about the right to take a life though this time its abortion not suicide thats in question And as in  Night Mother violence and death intrude suddenly upon ordinary lives Aside from such broad parallels however The Fortune Teller has little whatsoever in common with the authors piercing sharply observed play Whereas  Night Mother a twocharacter drama in which a young woman tells her mother that she intends to kill herself orchestrated layers of intimate details to delineate an entire emotional world The Fortune Teller gives us only the sketchiest sense of its peoples inner lives They remain caricatures whose sole function it seems is to move the story line along dutifully and predictably Theres Fay  the fortuneteller of the title  who also happens to be an overprotective mother Theres her daughter Lizzie who falls in love with a rich handsome boy Theres Fays lover Arnie a nice policeman who yearns for a peaceful life And there are the assorted sidekicks crazies and extras whose actions will give the principals something to react to Most of The Fortune Teller in fact consists of plot which quickly summarized goes like this 27 children have been kidnapped at the state fair and Arnie and his police buddies ask Fay to use her psychic power to help them in their search Bit by bit they figure out that the abductions are the work of antiabortion fanatics and in the course of the novels 24 chapters they recover the kids one by one In between shots are fired a bomb goes off a child is given an overdose of sleeping medication and messages are left in blood Many of Fays visions are fulfilled and coincidences proliferate it turns out that one of the antiabortion leaders has a personal grudge against Fay that the child of Fays best friend Gail bears an uncanny resemblance to the daughter of one of the conspirators etc There are assorted stakeouts chases and lastminute rescues in addition to rhetorical antiabortion statements abortion is murder murder is wrong and cliched arguments in favor of freedom of choice But the Supreme Court only has to say whats right They can protect the option of abortion in the name of freedom in the understanding of human error in the faith in a second chance There are also long sticky disquisitions on fortunetelling the meaning of various Tarot cards and the powers of the subconscious For instance There is only the unspeakable joy of eavesdropping on your spirit catching tiny glimpses of its independent life resting for a moment in its wisdom puzzling laughing sometimes over what its up to what it makes of you In Fays case it quickly becomes apparent that she has something on her mind besides the missing children Shes worried that her own daughter Lizzie is about to disappear  specifically that shes about to run away with her new boyfriend Paul a shallow manipulative kid whose father owns a yacht Fay has convinced herself that Paul is really the Devil  a character in the Tarot cards as well as the familiar figure of evil And she predicts that Lizzie will sail away with him bear his child and live unhappily ever after Whether this is warped projection of Fays own fears of desertion or another example of her proven abilities to look into the future doesnt really matter  her possessiveness and increasingly crazed behavior have the net effect of driving Lizzie further and further away No doubt Fays fears about Lizzie are meant to counterpoint and enhance the themes developed by the novels main line of action and touched upon as well by  Night Mother namely the inability of parents to insure their childrens happiness or safety and the responsibilities perils and limitations of familial love Clearly the exchanges between the two women provide some of the best most fully realized scenes in this novel but while they occasionally promise to open into the sort of painful revelatory talks that lent  Night Mother its power Ms Norman never allows them to develop fully Instead she tends to cut back to the novels busy narrative truncating discussions between mother and daughter and turning Fays meditations on her relationship with Lizzie into tritely worded declarations of pain But did I love her too much Fay wondered Tell her too often Did I make her feel bad because she could never love me as much as I loved her Maybe I did Maybe I drowned her in it Maybe I rained that love down on her so hard for so long that now all she wants is to live in the desert where she has to go out and look for water where she has to work for it where most of the time when she thinks she sees it its only a mirage The mother in  Night Mother probably harbored similar thoughts about her daughter  or at least allowed her mind to play over the same territory of guilt and doubt The difference is that such feelings emerged from her impassioned and despairing talks with her daughter the readeraudience was not told what to think in such baldly sentimental terms In the end its only one of many differences between The Fortune Teller and  Night Mother but its one that helps explain why the novel feels so contrived and heavyhanded
Letter From Italian Bishops Adds to Political Fray,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/world/letter-from-italian-bishops-adds-to-political-fray.html,Italys Roman Catholic bishops have entered a political debate by issuing a pastoral letter that is widely regarded as an election endorsement of the Christian Democrats The letter issued over the weekend has produced a stream of hostile reactions from other parties which have accused the church of meddling A Christian Democratic leader responded by saying his rivals were bigots for criticizing the bishops Caught up in the fray the bishops today for the second day issued a statement trying to clarify their position The polemics reflect a long controversy over the churchs role in Italian politics as well as the tensions building over the parliamentary elections June 14 Also the bishops touched on a potentially volatile political issue by calling on the faithful to defend traditional moral values when they enter the voting booth Phrases and Ideas Included Although the bishops letter does not specifically mention the Christian Democrats it includes phrases and ideas that hark back to a period in the 1940s and 1950s when the church provided the Christian Democrats with important and sometimes explicit backing Important Italian newspapers Sunday morning carried Page 1 headlines like The Bishops Vote Christian Democratic The letter came after a decision by the leader of Italys largest Catholic lay group Comunione e Liberazione to stand for election as a Christian Democrat Several political columnists have depicted the party as aligning itself with the church at a time when it is quarelling with the Socialists and other former allies Although acknowledging that not all Catholics need come to identical political choices the bishops insisted that not all choices are compatible with the faith and with the vision of man and society which faith breeds Although this is a position that Pope John Paul II has stated in his travels it has a particular resonance in Italy The letter emphasized church prohibitions on divorce and abortion as essential elements in making political choices Virtually all the major political parties except the Christian Democrats sided against the church when it unsuccesfully backed referendums to repeal exsisting laws on divorce in 1974 and abortion in 1981 After World War II The bishops also extolled faithfulness to the traditional unity of commitment by Italian Catholics language echoing statements made when the church supported the Christian Democrats as the only defense against the Communist Party during the first few elections after World War II John Paul set off a political furor by using the same language during the campaign for administrative elections in 1985 He was criticized by some of Italys leftist and centrists lay parties but reservations were also expressed by some bishops who have argued that the church should not resume its direct involvement in politics The Socialist newspaper Avanti immediately responded to the letter by labeling it an anachronism and arguing that Christian values can not be the exclusive patrimony on one political party Other criticism came from the centrist Republican and Liberal Parties the Communists and the rightist Social Movement The Socialists tempered their criticism Monday after a spokesman for the Italian Episcopal Conference said that the letter was intended to help the country as a whole by highlighting fundamental values and was not meant as an endorsement of one party But today the bishops disowned that statement In response to the critics the Christian Democrats president Arnaldo Forlani criticized resurgent anticlericalism and said there were bigots who would prevent the bishops from pronouncing themselves on the important things of life Adopting a strategy explicitly based on conservative morality would involve a switch for the Christian Democrats They had distanced themselves from the church as Italy produced a less religious and more secular society through the 1960s and 1970s
The A.C.L.U.'s Myopic Stand on AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/opinion/the-aclu-s-myopic-stand-on-aids.html,Remarkably the American Civil Liberties Union still adheres to a policy statement on AIDS that it issued in April 1986 The organization opposes testing for the AIDS virus unless a person wants it It opposes reporting of cases of AIDS by doctors hospitals and laboratories It opposes tracing those with whom the harborer of the virus has had sexual contact All in the name of privacy Though it may come as a surprise to most of its members too often in important ways the ACLU is a conservative backwardlooking organization trapped in vested doctrine It clings to once useful concepts that are inappropriate to current problems Like the French military which prepared for World War II by building the Maginot Line which was nicely adapted to the trench warfare of World War I the ACLU sometimes hauls up legal arguments effective in old libertarian battles but irrelevant to those at hand For example take literary censorship cases in the 1960s In opposing censorship the ACLU argued that publication of certain books created no clear and present danger to society The clear and present danger argument in the 1920s had been used to protect from prosecution people who expressed political opinions without direct incitement to lawbreaking But it had nothing to do with the question of whether and how far the First Amendment restricted antiobscenity statutes Those who sought to suppress books they considered obscene did not argue that the books would cause an immediate conflagration Rather they had in mind the books continuing effect on sexual morality Censors presented the familiar slipperyslope argument If the courts allowed the open publication of Lady Chatterleys Lover the next thing you know they would allow Tropic of Cancer and after that we would sink so low as to publish Fanny Hill That of course is exactly what happened Since the prospect of a gradual deterioration in morality over a period of time was put forward to justify suppression it made no sense to argue that there was no immediate and present danger of instantaneous destruction of morality as the ACLU did Instead the answer as the Supreme Court held was that a book that possessed some social value was part of the press which the First Amendment guarded The ACLU again looking backward today cannot depart from a concept of privacy that worked well for liberals in abortion cases heard by the courts The nation  indeed the world  faces the worst plague in history The ACLU however declares that efforts to deal with it are less important than the preservation of privacy It finds no compelling health purpose in testing except at the option of an individual in any requirement that test results showing the presence of the virus be identified and reported and in the tracing of sexual contacts In justifying these imperious pronouncements the ACLU cites basic constitutional guarantees individual rights and civil rights These terms are far too vaporous to support a constitutional restriction on action by the states A more concrete prohibition is required The only one the ACLU cites is the right to privacy There has been so much talk about privacy that it is worth recalling that the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution The Supreme Court has indeed inferred a right of privacy in certain cases But it carefully has limited its decisions to cases before it and has explicitly denied that there exists any broad general right of privacy that can stand in the way of legislation important to the public welfare The Justices or a majority of them found a right of privacy in the First Amendment when someone was prosecuted for viewing pornographic material in his own home They found it in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments when police behavior or other criminal enforcement tactics were too intrusive They found it in the Bill of Rights generally when they sanctioned giving out birth control information They found it in the 14th Amendment when they gave qualified approval to a personal choice on abortion In these decisions however the Court took pains to make it clear that though a constitutional right of privacy exists in certain contexts the right is not unqualified It is subject to a measure of state regulation and it must be weighed against important state interests There is a difference of opinion in the medical profession about the danger of AIDS but these differences all lie in a spectrum extending only from the terribly dangerous to the utterly disastrous And no scientist sees any early development of a cure or vaccine In these circumstances the situation we face falls well within the borders of the area in which the Court has said that the constitutional right of privacy must yield to considerations of public welfare Attempts to limit the spread of the disease by compulsory testing reporting and contacttracing can reasonably be presumed to have some restraining effect on the travels of the virus One can advocate personal rights that go beyond the definitions the courts have given Though the ACLU is basing its position on what it asserts are constitutional guarantees let us make it easier for the ACLU by shifting the issue from the law of privacy as it exists to the law as one might think it ought to be Is it good that there be testing that goes beyond an individuals request for it Is it good that there be identification and reporting of those who carry the virus Is it good that there be tracing of those to whom it may be reasonably supposed the virus has been transmitted and who may in turn transmit it to others Obviously these things are good Are they in the light of what we know about the disease less important than privacy The answer is plain except to those so infatuated with personal rights as to ignore the sorest community needs Part of the horror of the disease is its certain outcome The ACLU rather than receding from a cherished doctrine would allow a number of people  perhaps a very large number  to die this horrid death The organization apparently believes in a divine right of privacy which reigns supreme above reason and common decency
AT THE MOVIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/movies/at-the-movies.html,STANLEY KRAMER the independent producerdirector has accepted an offer by David Puttnam the president of Columbia Pictures to develop and direct an indefinite number of films subject to agreement on each project by both sides Puttnam has the soul of an independent Mr Kramer said He has a good track record Hes interested in films one can take pride in The arrangement is not exclusive but gives Columbia the right of first refusal on any project Mr Kramer suggests Mr Kramer who is 73 years old has been in selfimposed exile from Hollywood for the past eight years In 1978 before making his last relatively unsuccessful film The Runner Stumbles Mr Kramer moved to Seattle The film was released in 1979 and since then Mr Kramer has taught at the University of Washington and Bellevue Community College served as host of a local television program that ran classic films and written a weekly column for The Seattle Times His column was on everything from abortion to nuclear war  trying to be provocative elicit comment and bring myself up to date he said I felt that after being a half a step ahead for many years I was suddenly a half a step behind This helped me catch up again In an industry that has a short memory where directors and stars tend to be viewed as being as good as their most recent boxoffice grosses Mr Kramers return to Hollywood with the support of a powerful studio is unusual He has enjoyed nearly 40 years of movie making often making films on subjects that stressed social values personal morality and societal problems  Home of the Brave Death of a Salesman High Noon The Wild One and The Caine Mutiny which he produced and The Defiant Ones On the Beach Inherit the Wind Judgment at Nuremberg and Guess Whos Coming to Dinner which he directed and produced Then in 1979 he dropped out I went away to kind of contemplate my navel and think about what was happening all the things I didnt understand in terms of values of the kinds of films being made he said We chose Seattle because my wife read in some consumer magazine that it was the ideal American city Mr Kramer said he feels that his temporary withdrawal from the film industry has renewed his creativity I decided that somewhere between films on outer space and Sylvester Stallone there is a place for me he said I was always associated with films that had an opinion I dont believe films change anyones mind but I was spawned during the Roosevelt era a time of great change and I still believe in trying to get people to think Im very excited about being a participating mule again  thats mule with a kick Asked if he wanted to make films about social issues he replied Oh I dont know Im going to try to tell a personal story My first film is Chernobyl based on the book by the American doctor who went there after the disaster I want to stress the human denominator whether its Soviet or American dealing with the greatest issue of our time the threat of nuclear power and war His second project after Chernobyl is tentatively entitled Beirut Studios Racing to Beat July 1 Strike Deadline The impending Directors Guild strike is already being treated by most producers studio executives and directors as a reality Films now in production are under increased pressure to wrap before the July 1 strike deadline The fear of a strike is also wreaking havoc with some films leading to choices that may affect the careers of some talented people and the artistic direction of the films The United Artists production of Bright Lights Big City starring Michael J Fox and Dianne Wiest started shooting in New York on April 13 The movie based on the Jay McInerney novel of the same name was being made by the spunky team that created the successful lowbudget Smooth Talk Joyce Chopras directorial debut for Spectra Films It was directed by Ms Chopra with a screenplay by her husband Tom Cole The director of photography was James Glennon A few days ago United Artists and Mirage Productions the production company of Mark Rosenberg and Sydney Pollack announced that Ms Chopra Mr Cole and Mr Glennon had all been dismissed James Bridges Urban Cowboy and The China Syndrome is the new writerdirector and Gordon Willis both Godfather films Annie Hall and Manhattan is the new cinematographer The producers and studio executives gave the strike deadline as the main reason for the changes saying through a spokeswoman Peggy Seigal that a more experienced director was needed to make sure the film beat the deadline This was very upsetting for everyone involved said Ms Seigal In another change involving United Artists Martin Brest the director of Rainman starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise has resigned over what studio executives termed creative differences The film was to start shooting in April in order to be finished before the directors strike but was delayed until late August or September because of dissatisfaction with the original script by Barry Morrow Michael Bortman is now rewriting the script in which Mr Hoffman plays an idiot savant whose brother Mr Cruise gets him out of an institution to try to claim his inheritance According to filmindustry sources Mr Brest resigned because of differences over the final working script he was given Rainman is still scheduled to start shooting later this year but a new director has not been named yet New Film Sets Reversal Of Roles for America For years the story of the American abroad was always popular in Europe Brash naive awkward the bungling if wellmeaning American was always good for a tolerant if smug giggle Now a new film which is to be produced by Sandy Lieberson directed by the Irish film maker Pat OConnor Cal and distributed by Columbia Pictures turns the tables Stars and Bars with a screenplay by William Boyd based on his British novel is the story of a young Englishman whose greatest dream is to chuck his genteel British upbringing and become a successful aggressive unrepressed outgoing straightforward American  just the kind his grandfather would never have allowed in his club The movies crew will film exterior shots for one week on the streets of New York Daniel Day Lewis My Beautiful Laundrette and A Room With a View stars as the young Englishman Henderson Dores The production also stars Harry Dean Stanton and features a variety of performers with eclectic experience in film and theater such as Spalding Gray Martha Plimpton Joan Cusack Glenne Headly and Laurie Metcalf Ms Headly and Ms Metcalf are veterans of the Steppenwolf Theater Ensemble in Chicago Mr Lieberson is a former producing partner of David Puttnam head of Columbia Pictures An American who has lived in England for more than 20 years Mr Lieberson has been president of 20th CenturyFox in Los Angeles and chief of production of the British company Goldcrest He returned to independent producing in 1986 with Rita Sue and Bob Too which is to be shown at the Directors Fortnight at Cannes this weekend The film is a social comedy about a young woman growing up in a lowcost housing development in one of Englands most depressed areas It is to be released here this summer by Orion Classics Stars and Bars had been bought by Mr Puttnam before he went to Columbia He and Mr OConnor asked Mr Lieberson to take it on Mr Lieberson said he was attracted to the project because it was a satiric look at the clash of cultures between Americans and a particular type of Englishman I think the loss of empire and tradition in England has made tremendous changes in English culture over the years he said Before there was a guarantee of success regardless of ability for the upper classes Thats largely been changed With the changes in the London stock market that allow outsiders to trade more liberally a tremendous new kind of competition has begun which can be felt in the intellectual upper class particularly Many of the institutions that were English for so long are now owned by the Japanese or Americans or Arabs causing the English to reevaluate their work ethic So a character like ours wants to leave and go to the United States something that would have been inconceivable before said Mr Lieberson That very brashness they used to scorn they like it now it helps them get ahead Henderson Dores represents a new kind of Englishman  an upwardly mobile yuppie type scrambling to get into the oldboy network He has the credentials hes gone to the right schools but he isnt automatically on top of the world anymore Mr Liebersons next film financed by United Artists is to star David Bowie and Mick Jagger The script is being written by Richard Price The Color of Money

TODAY'S MORALITY PLAY: THE SITCOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/17/arts/today-s-morality-play-the-sitcom.html,IN THE CONTROVERSY OVER TV evangelism no one seems to have noticed that the most influential preacher in America is not Jim Bakker or Jerry Falwell or John Cardinal OConnor Rather it is Bill Cosby Every week his program and some others  Family Ties Growing Pains Mr Belvedere and My Sister Sam  present vivid and appealing paradigms of love to vast audiences This love is disclosed by the resolution of family tensions in the lives of characters who have become as real as your nextdoor neighbors  the Huxtable family of The Cosby Show Heathcliff Claire Sondra Denise Vanessa Theo and Rudi Family Ties  Alex Andy Jennifer and Mallory and their parents Steven and Elyse So we learn without even realizing it how to live lovingly in families The popularity of these current family situation comedies is so great in fact that this year The Cosby Show and Family Ties became respectively the first and second mostwatched programs in the history of television We laugh at the familiar pattern of conflict and tension created by family conflicts trivial and not so trivial like the possibility that an overstudious young woman will skip a grade an engagement announcement a 50th birthday a big telephone bill a fight between young lovers a decision by a boy that he wants to take flying lessons a wedding anniversary of grandparents the divorce of two friends an assault of flu on the family As we laugh we see the virtues required for conflict resolution such frequently honored but difficult qualities as patience trust sensitivity honesty generosity flexibility and forgiveness The shows rarely draw explicit moral conclusions for us Usually they do not insist on hammering home ethical principles Rather they hint lightly at the skills and traits that sustain love A modern version of the medieval morality play has slipped into primetime television almost without anyone noticing it There are exceptions to the general restraint about moralizing and preaching After the final commercial in an episode of Growing Pains Kirk Cameron who plays Mike steps out of character to emphasize the importance of saying no to cocaine addressing the young people in the audience directly In this seasons hourlong episode of Family Ties in which Alex  Michael J Fox  mourns for a dead friend he faces squarely problems of life and death meaning and belonging faith and despair But The Cosby Show rarely attempts to preach directly on the need for family love It doesnt have to Albert Bergesen a sociology professor at the University of Arizona and a student of popular culture argues that the appeal of The Cosby Show is to be found in the intensity of family love into which we slip when the program begins It is like a Franklin stove radiating warmth around which we crowd on a cold winter night We know about rising divorce rates singleparent families abortion incest wife beating teenage pregnancy but when the Huxtables are on screen we absorb their affection of a functioning intact family and feel good When the program is over we are more hopeful for families and for our own family It isnt merely the gentle moral lesson Its the appeal of love An escape When I listen Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony its an escape too But its also a renewal Cosby is No 1 because it has mastered the art of renewing hope for the family Your family The Cosby Show then provides moral paradigms and displays warm and renewing love Does that make it religious Sure it does Professor Bergesen says Family love is one of the tiny windows through which the Good or the Possible or God if you want to use the term peeks at us It is in the little things of life isnt it that we often find the meaning of the big things Having recently watched a couple score of tapes of Cosby Family Ties Growing Pains Mr Belvedere and My Sister Sam I am prepared to propose that anyone who can certify that they have viewed two of these programs in a week can be dispensed if not from weekend religious services then at least from the sermon They do it a lot better than we do it Some kids at a recent church meeting had told me about an episode of Growing Pains in which Matthew who is about 9 or 10 years old found himself in deep trouble because of lies about a call to a porno phone number which resulted in 65 extra on the phone bill What was the lesson of the show I asked them Dont lie to your parents when youre going to get caught a boy a couple of years older than Matt informed me Then thinking about it he added Well    dont lie to them ever I also think I collected enough sermon ideas for the next two years My homilies for Holy Week this year came out of the Family Ties story in which Alexs friend dies and Alex himself must undergo a painful confrontation with his own selfishness in order to put on the new man to become reborn How many clergy I wonder see the family programs as sermon material Very few probably Too busy being relevant And too blinded by the ecclesiastical and ideological concerns to see religion where the Founder saw it  in the ordinary daily lives of people The congregations certainly watch however I proposed recently in a parish in Tucson halffun and fullearnest that we think about The Martha Mary and Lazarus Show in which these three young people if they had not been young they would have been married who were unofficial foster children of Jesus be imagined as not much different from Theo Denise and Vanessa Huxtable The point was that the love among the three biblical figures was as authentically human love as that portrayed however simply in the Huxtable clan The congregation thought the series was a great idea Then moved by my success I noted that the appealing connection between the Michael J Fox character and his little brother was another template for family love I couldnt remember the name of the Fox role Whats he called I demanded Alex the congregation answered with more vigor than they normally use in the official responses of the mass And the little brother Every kid in church looked at me as if I were crazy Andy they shouted What kind of a geek doesnt remember a character whose name is the same as his own Are these ethical though not moralistic and religious though not ecclesiastical themes intended by those who produce the programs Family life has been the raw material of much of Bill Cosbys humor from the beginning of his career and it has always been a humor of love Perhaps his doctorate in education has made him more reflective about what he is doing more conscious of the moral and religious issues he is tackling but he has always been in his own way a minister of the word His program and the others are based on the insight that implicit ethics and religion in a matrix of humor are highly commercial in a country where meaning and belonging are as important as they have ever been and where those institutions traditionally charged with meaning and belonging  churches and schools  are failing to deliver sufficient amounts of either So ministers of religion condemn television and television does the work that they are not doing There are many ironies in the fire Critics of both the right and the left have been attacking the family comedies lately as they will do when something is extraordinarily successful The programs it is said are shallow and superficial They do not depict the anguish and suffering of many families or the discrimination against many black families They ignore the misery and unhappiness that plague many husbandwife and parentchildren relationships They deal only with intact uppermiddleclass families The characters are wimps never wanting as a Chicago critic observes comparing these programs unfavorably to the new Fox series Married   With Children in which the father is a real man to get away from the family and go to a Bulls game Like much media criticism these comments are the result of the fallacy of misplaced genre A halfhour TV program is not a threehour Broadway production A miracle play is not a sociological report or an ideological indoctrination It paints with quick broad strokes and says to us not this is the way all families are or this is what you must do but rather these are the skills needed to make intimacies work Those who demand that Cosby be more militant fail completely to understand the subtle boundaries that separate genres and the damage you do when you blur these boundaries Should The Cosby Show be turned into an ideological platform its fragile magic would destroyed Sometimes the acting in these programs is very sensitive In an episode of Mr Belvedere Kevin weary of his virginity decides to make it with a girl with a reputation But Kevins natural courtesy  opening doors helping her on with her coat giving her flowers  persuades the girl that she need not be easy to be loved Kevin remains a virgin but he helps the girl to acquire selfesteem and transform herself The subtle interplay between the two young people played by Rob Stone and Debbie Barker provided some of the most touching and skillful scenes Ive ever seen on television The jokes on these shows are frequently very clever and telling of our times On an episode of My Sister Sam for example Sams agent about to give her advice about trusting her teenage sister Patty and still imposing limits says I dont have any children of my own but I do watch AM television    My Sister Sam in fact is not about an intact family Sam is a single woman photographer in San Francisco who has a relationship with a man who dwells in New York Patty shares Sams San Francisco loft a much hipper setting and situation than the Huxtable house But the conflicts the problems and the love are similar to what we see in the other programs Indeed trust is the virtue unremittingly extolled in the episodes I have watched of this show But there is more to religion is there not than mere family love What about peace and hunger and the Third World Social concern that worries about the distant neighbor and ignores the intimate neighbor is likely to be neither healthy nor durable nor successful Religion that has forgotten the importance and the difficulty of the most intimate of relationships is not likely to be taken seriously when it pontificates on other relationships Surely religion ought to have immense social implications But these implications will not be recognized unless religion also provides satisfying paradigms for the meaning of life and the healing of the wounds acquired and imposed in trying to love the intimate other The basic objection to Cosby et al is that they are about intact middleclass families a social institution that many Americans in the cultural elite and this includes not a few clerics think or would like to think is obsolete Whats wrong with a few programs about intact families Television viewers in America including many who are not in intact families seem to disagree with that cultural elite Based on the popularity of these shows the public apparently believes that an intact family is better on the whole than an unintact family Sometimes it may be necessary to be a single parent but on the whole it is better to be a married parent Because single parents and broken families are increasing it does not follow the public seems to think that the intact and affectionate family is any less the ideal or that familial love even in unusual situations such as that illustrated by My Sister Sam is any less important The appeal of the shows is their portrait of family love whether the family be intact or not
A ZIMBABWE ISSUE: KILLING OF BABIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/17/world/a-zimbabwe-issue-killing-of-babies.html,Eriya Jokasi was 38 years old unemployed and a widow with seven children when she secretly gave birth to a baby in a cornfield and using a heavy rock killed it Mrs Jokasi uneducated and dependent on her tribal chief for financial support told the police that she killed the infant out of fear that her dead husbands relatives would expel her from their rural village if they learned she had had another mans child She was sentenced to nine years in prison But the Zimbabwe Supreme Court calling for more research into the underlying causes of such killings later reduced the sentence to four years The court case and the judgments highlight both the psychological pressures involved in what is known here as baby dumping and the ways that this southern African nation is grappling with the issue as one that is as much sociological as it is criminal A Widespread Problem Infanticide of course is not peculiar to Zimbabwe and sociologists maintain that improvements in a nations social and economic conditions can reduce the number of such cases Since 1967 courts here have given about 90 prison sentences to women charged with killing their babies Zimbabwean law does not differentiate between murder and infanticide as crime But one supporter of womens rights said the number of cases did not reflect the seriousness of the problem because the percentage of actual incidents which no one can determine is another thing entirely Many Zimbabweans view the crime as abhorrent and callously premeditated But some lawyers and womens rights groups say it often represents an act of desperation in maledominated Africa where women have low status and few options and tend to be economically dependent Some women conceal pregnancies and then kill their babies in the view of these lawyers and rights groups because they fear abandonment by parents who would lose much of the lobola or the brides price that a family might have received from a suitor had their daughter remained a virgin Stigma of Rape This group includes schoolgirls who have been educated to increase the amount of lobola that families can demand and who face expulsion from school and rejection by their families if they become pregnant Others may be victims of rape but fearing divorce or ostracism because of the social stigma do not report it Still other women become pregnant because of promises of marriage Among some ethnic groups a woman must conceive before marriage to prove that she is fertile but later may be abandoned by the babys father The father can be ordered by the court to provide child support but such payments are said to be rare Abortion is illegal in Zimbabwe except in specific cases such as rape or incest Still Government gynecologists estimate that 40000 illegal and often dangerous abortions are done each year A widely held belief here is that legalized abortion would increase promiscuity The same attitude undermines the use of contraceptives some womens groups say Older women often accuse younger ones of being prostitutes if they use birthcontrol methods And husbands accuse their wives of using contraceptives so they can have extramarital affairs Infertility Feared Many women who have been raised to believe that their primary function is to bear children also fear that the use of birth control could make them infertile If a woman is rejected by her family and the father of the child and has no job and nowhere to go these sorts of things crowd in on her and often force her to kill her baby said Kathy OMeara a lawyer at the Harare Legal Projects center She has studied sentencing patterns of women convicted of killing infants and has represented women in court who were convicted of the crime The courts are beginning to take these things into account she said and are realizing that killing a baby is often more sociological than a straight crime Prison sentences of up to 10 years have been handed down for the offense according to court documents with the most common sentences ranging from three to five years The Supreme Court decision last year in the Jokasi case was seen by womens groups as a major judicial shift toward greater sensitivity in sentencing Problem for Society The court that gave Mrs Jokasi the nineyear sentence said she showed an unbelievable degree of callousness When the Supreme Court reduced the sentence a justice recommended that the problem be dealt with by society as a whole and called for greater research Until solid findings are available the justice said the courts should avoid the extreme of severity presented by sentences of seven to 10 years Judges are beginning to realize that baby dumping is a crime of selfdefense said Peggy Watson a member of the Womens Action Group which was formed in 1983 to safeguard the rights of women and to research the killing of infants As such there should be more understanding she said It is often not an act of gross wanton cruelty but women fighting for their own survival

"EVANGELICALS FLOURISH, WITH NEW YORK TOUCH",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/nyregion/evangelicals-flourish-with-new-york-touch.html,With a Bible open before him the Rev Daniel Mercaldo spoke

sex and money  Christian evangelical congregations such as Mr Mercaldos are flourishing Like their colleagues around the nation the New Yorkers preach a message of conservative family values and rebirth in Jesus When talking about a congregants life they mention their birthday and the day they were born again in Christ Warning of Temptation But as they spread the word of the gospel they do so with a distinct approach The appeal takes into account the religious diversity of New York as well as warnings about the citys temptations And the accent is decidedly more Brooklyn and Queens than Georgia or Louisiana As for the scandals in the Southern evangelical television ministries centered on the Rev Jim Bakker formerly of the PTL ministry  leaders of New York congregations see little danger to themselves and even possible benefits In the long range people are going to reprioritize where they are going to give their money and their time said Mr Mercaldo a Queens native whose crossshaped pulpit is flanked by an organ and a set of drums Theyre tired of turning on their television sets on Sunday morning and hearing three Southerners People are looking for a preacher with a Queens accent Joe Battaglia general manager of WWDJ a contemporary Christian radio station with 177100 weekly listeners in the New York area said that New York evangelicals do not fit the stereotype Evangelicals are usually seen as Southern rural uneducated conservative Republicans he said In our market that is totally wrong They may be conservative in values but not in their political persuasion Executives Discuss Ethics For example many of his listeners favor increased government programs for the poor and a freeze on nuclear weapons believing those positions are consistent with what Christ wants our lives to be like Mr Battaglia said There is a group of Wall Street executives who meet regularly to discuss Christian ethics Mr Battaglia said as well as active Evangelicals in the arts sports entertainment and business Pastors at the New York churches acknowledging that they are part of a minority movement said that they tend to be less insulated than their colleagues in the Bible Belt We often feel more comfortable with the rabbi down the street than the Baptist preacher down South said the Rev David Hudson executive pastor of Gateway Cathedral Evangelicals  Christians who take the Scripture literally and emphasize salvation by faith  do not have strong roots in the New York area where Roman Catholics Jews and mainline Protestant denominations have historically predominated The Impact of Carter But in recent years their numbers have been growing as the result of migration from the South the winning of converts and the willingness of those within mainline Protestant denominations to be identified as Evangelicals according to Jim Castelli who writes a syndicated religion column with the pollster George Gallup The growth has been particularly strong he said among blacks and Hispanic people According to the Gallup Poll 3 of 10 Americans describe themselves as Evangelicals or born again Christians While they make up as much as half the population in the socalled Bible Belt states of the South and Midwest they account for roughly 15 percent of those in the New York area according to the poll These figures represent growth pollsters say although there are no surveys from previous years for a comparison For one thing they note in past decades some were reticent to say publicly that they were Evangelical Among the factors that changed that was the election of a born again Christian Jimmy Carter to the White House in 1976 The church services have attracted followers by their familyoriented message and inspirational services On Sunday at Bethlehem Church in Richmond Hill Queens a full house of 600 worshipers sang spirited hymns held hands in prayer and fell silent as a congregant was seized by the spirit and spoke in unintelligible speech known as tounges The utterances are believed by some Christian groups to be supernatural gifts in which the person is serving as a channel of divine proclamation Leadership Is Solid The church is a member of the Assemblies of God the same church that recently defrocked Mr Bakker of the PTL ministry Around the country Sunday had been designated for prayer and fasting for the shame brought upon the denomination by Mr Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye Nonetheless the pastor the Rev William J Behr made no mention of the couple during the 90 minute service The Bakker scandals have not shaken his congregation said Mr Behr using the barometer of attendance and contributions both of which have continued to increase in recent weeks People know the leadership here is solid he said Never Been Busier Another indication of Evangelical strength in New York is the pace in recent weeks at Fundamentalists Anonymous Weve never been busier said James Luce associate executive director of the organization that seeks to help those who feel trapped in the Evangelical wing known as Fundamentalism According to Mr Luce Fundamentalists tend to see the world in absolutes and are likely to break off contact with those who do not agree with them Since the PTL scandal broke in March the number of letters and calls to Fundamentalists Anonymous has doubled to 150 a day Mr Luce said One person who sought help was David Hargett a 26yearold graphic artist from Syracuse who said he found friendship in an alien city when he joined a Manhattan fundamentalist church He decided to leave he said when he found the church controlling my life going so far as to tell him who his friends should be what he should do with his money and where he should work Mr Mercaldo the Staten Island preacher said that Evangelicals in New York have to be aggressive in seeking converts If you lay back in New York the city will gobble you up he said Were going on the offensive in aggressively living out the Christian life
Pressure Outweighs Rhetoric in Abortion Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/opinion/l-pressure-outweighs-rhetoric-in-abortion-fight-861887.html,To the Editor How RighttoLifers Promote Abortion your May 9 editorial on world population control makes a common rhetorical error It is fruitless to use ancient methods of persuasion in this case the device of irony to counter absolutist arguments Righttolifers are not morons and are as capable as anyone of understanding that successfully pressuring the Government to stop supporting family planning programs overseas is bound to result in countless homemade abortions But for people to whom opposing abortion is a moral requisite logical consistency does not enter the picture They can do nothing about a poor woman in Kenya mutilating herself for want of a doctor so in support of their conviction they use their influence where they can in Washington where they have every right to lobby And it is in Washington where they can be opposed  not in the school of rhetoric JON SOBEL Fairview NJ May 10 1987
PANEL APPROVES A KEY MEASURE TO BATTLE BIAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/us/panel-approves-a-key-measure-to-battle-bias.html,A Senate committee gave overwhelming approval today to a measure expanding the Governments power to fight discrimination A 1984 Supreme Court decision had significantly narrowed Federal enforcement powers and this bill overturning the Courts interpretation has been viewed as the most important civil rights measure to come before Congress in years The bill the Civil Rights Restoration Act has bipartisan support in the Labor and Human Resources committee which adopted it by a vote of 12 to 4 and in both houses of Congress where its chances of passage seem good I think the overwhelming bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans Northerners and Southerners is a clear vindication of the rights of women the handicapped minorities and the elderly Senator Edward M Kennedy the committee chairman said after the vote Fiftytwo senators are listed as cosponsors of the bill and at least threefourths of the House has voiced support Even opponents acknowledged that the measure may have overcome its most difficult hurdle today President Reagan is another hurdle Albert R Brashear a White House spokesman said today that the President had not yet formulated a position on the bill But William Bradford Reynolds who heads the Justice Departments civil rights division said in a statement today We think the debate at the markup points up the many problems with the bill We remain firmly opposed to it Withholding Federal Funds The bill the result of a long and difficult battle and entangled in a dispute over abortion involves laws that prohibit discrimination by the recipients of Federal funds the withholding of Federal money is one of the Governments most powerful civil rights tools In a 1984 case involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania the Supreme Court interpreted such a law to ban sex discrimination only in a specific program or activity receiving Federal aid not in the entire institution In theory then a college could discriminate in its athletic program as long as it did not discriminate in granting scholarships to students if that was the only program getting Federal aid Most civil rights advocates saw that interpretation as tying the hands of the Government in fighting bias but the Reagan Administration had argued for the limited view and said the High Courts interpretation would be applied to other civil rights laws with the same program or activity language Thus the impact of the ruling which involved educational institutions was extended to corporations local governments hospital airports and other private and public institutions that receive Federal financial assistance Proponents of the measure the committee passed today said the bill would merely restore the coverage of civil rights statutes to what they were before the Courts 1984 decision by specifying that the bans on discrimination was institutionwide But opponents asserted that the legislation goes well beyond the scope of the laws and in fact broadened and expanded coverage The four statutes involved are Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 which prohibits sex discrimination Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination based on race Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which forbids discrimination based on handicap and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 Debate Centered on Abortion The main focus of debate arose in the context of Title IX the law barring sex discrimination in educational institutions It specifies that any institution receiving Federal funds shall treat pregnancy childbirth false pregnancy termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability Senator Gordon J Humphrey a New Hampshire Republican on the committee argued that this could force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their religious principles Under language contained in the bill approved today any institution controlled by a religious organization could apply for an exemption from Title IX regulations conflicting with their tenets but Mr Humphrey said that did not fully address the problem and offered an amendment specifying that nothing in the bill should be construed as either granting or denying abortion rights The amendment was rejected 11 to 5 Abortion is legal in the United States said Senator Lowell P Weicker Republican of Connecticut What this bill says is that if you accept Federal funds then you cannot deny the rights of any individual Civil rights groups hailed todays action Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said it had ended years of frustration For three years weve not had the opportunity to vote the bill up or down because the thenchairman of committee Senator Hatch refused to let the bill out said Mr Neas as he stood in a hallway adjoining the Senate conference room surrounded by wellwishers some in wheelchairs Now you see what happens when you have a civil rights champion in charge of the committee

THEY NEVER WANTED TO BE THEMSELVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/they-never-wanted-to-be-themselves.html,YOU CANT GET LOST IN CAPE TOWN By Zoe Wicomb 185 pp New York Pantheon Books Cloth 1095 Paper 695 IN the title story of Zoe Wicombs superb first collection of stories You Cant Get Lost in Cape Town the narrator a young coloured South African woman who is winding up a relationship with a white man visits an abortionist in Cape Town The abortionist a middleaged white woman who doesnt want trouble with the law asks Youre not Coloured are you No the firstperson narrator lies Good says the abortionist This is a respectable concern    you can trust me No Coloured girls ever been on this sofa After the abortion the woman counts up the coins the narrator has given her and satisfied plants the kiss of complicity on the patient These connected stories written by a native South African now living in England turn on just such real or imagined collusions in racial crimes The main characters are mixedrace South Africans They accept their Governments equation of selfworth with racial classification As coloured they occupy a solid middle position with whites above and blacks below They long for flickable straight hair and sharp noses They heat metal combs on primus stoves hidden in back rooms Ruthlessly obsessively they bind their napecurls or beat them down with Vaseline Even the weather can let the coloured down Cape Town with its damp and misty mornings is no good for the hair The narrator Frieda escapes these myriad petty tyrannies through expatriation The deeper scars may call her back Race is inescapable in Cape Town The allpervasive classification law saves one from getting lost anywhere in the country A train ride to a girls boarding school a bus ride in the city an overnight visit with an old school friend now a married Cape Town version of yuppie  race and its attendant humiliations and paranoias intrude into every ordinary private activity Yet the political points are scored delicately Race is always in Nadine Gordimers words something out there Race laws are most cruelly operative when unseen and presumably unenforced internalized  the test of the artist lies in exploring the varieties of selfimposed oppression One is reminded of astronomers calculations their ability to plot the exact size and position of unseen bodies from the mild deviations of objects at hand Apartheid the white world and the coming racial collision are the unmoved movers in nearly all these stories In When the Train Comes Frieda the first nonwhite to be allowed into a previously allwhite Anglican school has to board the train for school in dustcoated new shoes because the paved section of the station is for whites only No soapbox hysteria here Not even when in the title story Frieda describes the thrills of her unlawful interracial affair with Michael a blond fellow student at her university We do not fear the police with their torches Frieda confesses what she fears is trapping the decent Michael into marriage and exile Ms Wicombs characters  mostly Friedas relatives and neighbors  do not condone the system of racial classification even if some of them go along with the segregated seating in buses and the segregated waiting rooms in doctors offices In Bowl Like Hole Friedas mother remarks We all have to put up with things we dont understand She forces her child to speak English rather than Afrikaans because she looks on English as the language of selfimprovement She doesnt expect the English language to satisfy her sense of justice or logic When she discovers accidentally that bowl does not rhyme with howl and scowl and fowl she unlike her husband an English teacher corrects her own mispronunciation promptly A FEW others subvert the apartheid system In the title story a maid brags on a public bus that she steals chicken legs from the family she cooks for in order to even out the systemic injustice In Ash on My Sleeve Moira a beautiful coloured housewife and mother who lives in a suburban house with a stoop and a garden regularly provides secret asylum to black men caught in town without passes In Behind the Bougainvillea Henry an intimidating black man in reflector sunglasses revives Frieda from her fainting spell in a doctors office carries her off to the room of one of his girlfriends allows her to see the contents of his bag a revolver a map and a hip flask reminds her that he had deepkissed her as a schoolchild then makes love to her Frieda who as a schoolgirl had disavowed enjoying his kiss and writing letters to him Would I be writing to a native now accepts Henrys crudely vengeful justice She confesses I have always miscalculated the currency of sex Henry is rumored to be both a guerrilla and a Government agent Some flee the racial crucible of their country They settle in Canada  which one of Friedas uncles describes in Home Sweet Home with unintentional irony as really    the land for the white man because it is cold and snowy Frieda exiles herself to Britain I will not come back she promises herself bitterly I will never live in this country again Ms Wicombs subject isnt  as American readers might expect  simple apartheid It is the desperate search of the coloured for identity in a harshly hierarchical society In this acceptance of apartheid and the desire to see beyond it Ms Wicomb follows Faulkner and certainly echoes her black countryman Njabulo Ndebele who in his recent collection Fools and Other Stories wrote Our literature ought to seek to move away from an easy preoccupation with demonstrating the obvious existence of oppression It exists The task is to explore how and why people can survive under such harsh conditions Moira the housewifeactivist articulates this necessity Coloureds havent been around for that long perhaps thats why we stray Just think in our teens we wanted to be white now we want to be fullblooded Africans Weve never wanted to be ourselves and thats why we stray    across the continent across the oceans and even here right into the Tricameral Parliament playing into their hands Actually    it suits me very well to live here Ms Wicombs prose is vigorous textured lyrical An alien landscape  the veld riotous with proteas the tangled bush the clearings for dingy townships the hills aglow with light from the Southern Cross  is rendered vividly The smallest gestures  the gyre of yellow mealiemeal boiling in a pot or a cooks fingers kneading pastry  are invested with arresting images Desire is a Tsafendas tapeworm in my belly that cannot be satisfied This is a sophisticated storyteller who combines the openendedness of contemporary fiction with the force of autobiography and the simplicity of family stories In A Fair Exchange Frieda who has become a writer comments on narrative strategies without the archness of conventional metafiction Ms Wicomb tackles familiar expatriate themes  growing up in a racist and traditional culture breaking away and coming back  without the selfinflicted ironies of most nonwhite expatriate writers Her characters struggle through language English Afrikaans Xhosa and in the end come to terms with who they are There is a glossary for the appropriated Afrikaans words In the last story A Trip to the Gifberge Frieda confides to her mother that she is considering coming back to Cape Town to live With something to do here at home her mother teases perhaps you wont need to make up those terrible stories hey One hopes Ms Wicomb herself will continue to make up her terrible and wonderful stories THE SNOB VALUE OF ENGLISH My parents were both Afrikaans speakers but they were rather ambitious and wanted their children to speak English Zoe Wicomb said in a telephone interview from England where she has lived for most of the last 16 years So they taught us but it was an English they werent very sure of themselves  no one within 200 miles spoke it Ms Wicomb was a child living in a remote settlement in Cape Province South Africa when she first encountered the snob value of the English language By age 22 after attending the University of the Western Cape the young woman designated coloured in the official Government lexicon was restless for change I left partly for adventure partly because there wasnt much opportunity in South Africa said Ms Wicomb who became a teacher in England And then there was always the sense that life in Europe would be so much better  one felt that racism had to do with apartheid Now 38 she finds sadness in her selfimposed exile I acquired British citizenship and then I found it difficult to go back she said I was terribly naive and I didnt realize the implications Though not autobiographical You Cant Get Lost in Cape Town is infused with the authors anger at the patina of egalitarianism in a society that had been held out to her as the worlds most civilized England is deeply racist she said but at the same time there is this extraordinary rhetoric which denies racism  the thing about the English is that they wont ever talk about anything unpleasant The stories also reflect Ms Wicombs efforts to come to terms with the many years away from home I feel desperately homesick  perhaps thats why I wrote the book she said And with that is the guilt that I left in the first place Ive written about a place that I actually abandoned KIM HERON
TRAVELIN' MAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/travelin-man.html,HAMMER By Armand Hammer with Neil Lyndon Illustrated 544 pp New York G P Putnams Sons 2295 THERE was a documentary on public television the other day showing how businessmen are generally portrayed on prime time as grasping moneygrubbing swindlers and crooks Its as if the creators of these programs had taken as their motto Balzacs saying Behind every great fortune there is a great crime They might argue in their defense that they are only portraying society as it is since each day provides new examples of insider trading and boardroom malfeasance If people get tired of J R a miniseries based on Ivan Boesky might do just as well This vision of capitalism as a piranha pond is given a useful corrective in the life story of Armand Hammer who took over his fathers small faltering pharmaceutical business and made a success of it while still in college And yet this is not the usual ragstoriches story with the usual Horatio Alger platitudes The twist is that Dr Hammer prospered by doing business with the Russians Hammer is the record of an enviable full life written by a man who is 88 years old with the acknowledged help of a freelance writer Neil Lyndon There was an element of filial piety in Dr Hammers fascination with the Soviet Union His parents were of Russian origin and his father appears to have been a quixotic man a romantic in temperament and a founding member of the American Communist Party Armand was named both for Armand Duval the hero of the Dumas fils play La Dame aux Camelias and for the armandhammer symbol of the Socialist Labor Party His father Julius was a doctor who got into serious trouble when he gave an abortion to a patient who had tried to abort herself with a darning needle When the woman died probably of influenza complicated by peritonitis Julius Hammer was charged with manslaughter convicted and sentenced to 3 12 to 15 years in Sing Sing of which he served the minimum This shame on the family was crucial to Dr Hammers development for it allowed him to do something he turned out to be very good at take charge He arranged for his fathers defense and became the titular head of the family while attending medical school at Columbia Unversity It was the first flowering of a remarkable ability to assume responsibility for others which is probably at the core of all entrepreneurial success In the odd way family calamities sometimes recur down the generations he would many years later have to intervene in a similar manner when his son Julian was also arrested for manslaughter In this case it was a drunken Army buddy who made passes at his wife and threatened him with a beer bottle Julian shot him and his father hired a good lawyer who got the case dismissed without a trial From these two incidents one can form an image of Armand Hammer suspended between two generations  between a father and a son both of whom were accused of killing another person  and acting as problem solver The decisive moment for Dr Hammer came in 1921 when he was 23 years old In Russia the Bolshevik regime was in its infancy crippled by famine and a typhus epidemic To most Americans this news of distress in a faroff land was less urgent than their morning coffee But Dr Hammer decided to take a field hospital to Russia and help the typhus victims In this humanitarian endeavor he showed the secret of his business success the ability to close the gap between thought and deed Many persons have grandiose ideas which they dont follow up on To take a field hospital at his own expense to a country in turmoil where he did not speak the language and where foreigners were viewed with suspicion verged on the ludicrous And yet he went ahead overcoming all bureaucratic obstacles and in the course of his medical work he came across a business opportunity There was starvation in the Urals and Dr Hammer offered to trade American grain for Russian furs and caviar Lenin wanted to meet this young American capitalist and urged him to take a commerical concession Dr Hammer thus became the Soviet Unions first American concessionaire with an asbestos mine and a pencil factory  the asbestos was sold as insulating material for Russian pipes and boilers and the factory is producing pencils to this day He dealt directly with Lenin whom he found to be far more pragmatic than he had expected Lenin was willing to admit that Communism was not working and that the Revolution needed American capital and technical aid In retrospect he reminded Dr Hammer of his hero Franklin Roosevelt Both men were approachable had a sense of humor and displayed a dazzling intellectual flexibility Dr Hammer remained in Russia until 1930 the only American entrepreneur who made a fortune under the Communists not only in money but in Czarist artworks he bought from the Bolsheviks He opened the Hammer Galleries in 1932 and hit on the novel marketing device of selling his Russian art at Marshall Fields in Chicago and Gimbels in New York after being turned down by Macys No doubt about it he had the Midas touch In fact there is something so relentless about his winning streak that I began to want to see him fall flat on his face at least once  but he never does He even tells us that while waiting to see President Roosevelt at the White House in the 30s he shot craps with FDRs aide Pa Watson and won 300 And yet what is the Midas touch but the ability to recognize what someone else does not as when he bought some watercolors that he says other dealers had rejected and they turned out to be by the Impressionist master Pissarro Or when he briefly went into the cooperage business When FDR moved to repeal Prohibition the brewers had no barrels for their beer the makers of staves having gone out of business Dr Hammer bought unshaped staves from the Russians built his own staveshaping plant and produced thousands of barrels for AnheuserBusch That was a fivefinger exercise compared to his chance investment in the oil business Once again the luck of the capable was with him for the first lease he bought into struck oil in 1956 He started to finance a tiny company called Occidental Petroleum that year later expanding its small California leases into a huge operation in Libya and the North Sea The story of how he competed successfully for Libyan leases against 40 other companies is a classic example of finding a way to outmaneuver the competition Dr Hammer promised to drill not only for oil but for water and he did indeed tap into a huge reserve of water endearing him to his hosts He had set out to ruffle the petticoats of the Seven Sisters and he eventually almost matched them in size With the advent of Col Muammar elQaddafi and the threat of nationalization Dr Hammer in the 1970s started pulling out of Libya and into North Sea oil and he says that when President Reagan in January 1986 banned all United States trade with Libya Occidental was able to comply effortlessly In the international entrepreneur of the Armand Hammer variety we find the last refuge of the picaresque Every deal is an adventure Villains like the Shah of Iran who tried to trick Dr Hammer into accepting a takeover bid for Occidental lurk in wait to strip you of your profits You rub shoulders with the mighty of the world The author shows us Leonid Brezhnev in 1973 worrying about President Nixons Watergate dilemma and saying to Dr Hammer with evident sincerity A man can only stand so much and then hes bound to break down I like the idea of chiefs of state of hostile powers being underneath it all kindred spirits who understand each others problems THERE are times however when Dr Hammers hobnobbing with world leaders is irritating for in order to maintain his most favored person position with the Russians he becomes disturbingly sycophantic I found Mr Brezhnev to be a man of great humanism and vast warmth he writes Brezhnevs emotions were deep and his eyes quickly filled with tears when his sentiments were stirred Were they stirred one wonders by the thousands of detainees in the gulags In addition Dr Hammer presents himself as the architect of world peace instrumental in arranging the 1985 Geneva summit between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan shuttling back and forth between Moscow and Washington on his vital mission In fact he is more like an enthusiastic amateur trying to break into the major leagues a George Plimpton of international relations Dr Hammers original impulse in going to Russia which was humanitarian still coexists with his business ventures Of course he goes there partly to gain access but so what Are there any unmixed motives For example at the time of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 it was Dr Hammer who sent the bonemarrow transplant specialist Robert Peter Gale to Moscow where he operated on some of the worst radiation cases It was a fairly complicated matter for a private citizen to set up but it was done and it provided an example of American good will at a time when some of our newspapers were printing wild stories about Chernobyl angering the Russians In the course of amassing a fortune Dr Hammer has managed to turn himself into a sort of living footnote to some of the principal events of his time That his book sounds like the Shakespearean kings cycle told by a courtier does not diminish it for great events seen through the eyes of a minor character have a fascination for us  we can identify with him Armand Hammer can be forgiven his bursts of selfaggrandizement and his sometimes jejeune political views in light of his ability to do what other men only ponder his skill at giving as well as making money and his persistent role as a SovietAmerican gobetween
TURNING KIDS OFF DRUGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/magazine/turning-kids-off-drugs.html,PAULA HAS BEEN A PROSTItute She has stood on street corners hawking cocaine just to be able to afford it herself She has been a vagabond a truant and a criminal but in her 15 years she has barely been a child  I started seeing my druggie boyfriend when I was 9 Paula says her blond hair clipped back in barrettes her face swollen from crying I let him beat me up he broke my lip gave me a black eye I started having sex with him when I was 12 then I started to do drugs Thats all I cared about after a while If I couldnt get money for drugs Id abuse myself Id beat myself with a brush so I would forget about the drugs I would go to disgusting hotels with men and let them do anything to me just to get more drugs I got diseases this terrible infection When I was 14 I got pregnant The day I had my abortion I went out on the street to sell drugs so I could buy some PCP I was bleeding I was sick But I didnt care Only drugs mattered While Paula talks about 125 people listen and stare intently What she says does not shock her young audience it only reminds them of how their own compulsions drove them to similar horrors As the day goes on many of them will describe their own experiences Some stories will be even more appalling than Paulas The confessions blunt humiliating and public are the heart of a threeyearold program in Hackensack N J  KIDS of Bergen County  that treats adolescents with compulsive disorders mostly drug and alcohol abuse For the sake of privacy the teenagers in the program are identified by first name only KIDS a private nonprofit group is unusual and somewhat controversial As the photographs on the following pages dramatically show the process of treatment is painful It does not rely solely on social workers psychologists or doctors to help an addicted child It uses the two strongest influences on a child as its primary therapeutic tools peers and family For a teenager to be accepted parents and siblings must agree to participate actively They must attend therapy sessions and two evening meetings a week for the duration of the treatment and when their teenager progresses in the program they must allow newer clients to stay at their home In the initial stages of the fivephase program the teenager sleeps in the home of another participant further along in treatment and spends 85 hours a week in intensive peergroup therapy Because the counselors are themselves former addicts who have graduated from the program the teenagers cannot dismiss them as a bunch of adults who dont understand Rehabilitation programs vary experts say no one approach is right for all children and all programs have their advocates and critics KIDS is sometimes labeled coercive and rigid Although former addicts often become counselors more traditional therapists have questioned their use as the mainstay of KIDS The architect of the program however believes their role is vital Kids push each other to get honest the same way kids push each other to start taking the drugs says Dr Miller Newton a medical anthropologist psychotherapist and the founder of KIDS who a year and a half ago was appointed by Gov Thomas H Kean as a charter member of the New Jersey Substance Abuse Advisory Council Truthfully though its a tough program and a lot of people are looking for a magic wand The program was born of Dr Newtons own confrontation with teenage drug abuse Mark the youngest of his three children started using alcohol and drugs when he was 12 years old It was 1979 and Dr Miller was then executive director of the Florida Association of Alcohol Treatment Programs his wife Ruth Ann was a counselor with an alcohol rehabilitation program for adults in Tampa They had missed the signs they were trained to spot You never know which kid is going to end up using drugs or alcohol says Dr Newton I would have guessed Mark was the least likely of my kids to get involved But adolescence can turn a kid around The Newtons enrolled their son in STRAIGHT a treatment program for teenagers in St Petersburg Within a few months Dr Newton became director of STRAIGHT and Mrs Newton joined the staff In 1983 a former patients father persuaded the Newtons to develop a similar program in northern New Jersey In May 1984 KIDS of Bergen County opened its doors A second KIDS program now operates in El Paso Tex Its very scary very frightening when you realize its your kid and hes addicted says Dr Newton You realize theres no guarantee hes going to get well Mark survived and is attending college in Florida Although recidivism is hard to measure because the program is so new about 40 percent of those who enter KIDS drop out before the program ends according to statistics provided by Dr Newton Of those who complete the course 70 percent can be expected to stay straight a figure comparable to other successful rehabilitation programs But that is not always the case with young people who let their guards down to peer pressure and drugs Last March in Bergenfield NJ four teenagers locked themselves in a car and ran the engine until they suffocated Traces of cocaine and alcohol were found in their blood All of them had been at one time or another in rehabilitation programs News of the suicides echoed painfully among the teenagers in KIDS Almost all of them at least once had imagined themselves in the same position CELESTE IS A BRIGHT ARTICULATE 18yearold with gentle brown eyes and a raspy laugh For three years she had been using pot alcohol cocaine mescaline and PCP or angel dust Last spring she tried to kill herself I hated the person I became says Celeste I thought it would never get better I walked into my druggie boyfriends bathroom one day and put a bunch of pills in my hand I felt so trapped Should I I thought I had nothing to lose Why not Her parents had heard of KIDS through a local support group On Sept 13 1986 Celeste signed herself in Experts struggle to explain why so many young people today abuse themselves with drugs alcohol even food In the past decade while overall mortality rates have declined the rate of teenage deaths has risen by 16 percent Automobile and other accidents accounted for the most fatalities followed by suicide and homicide alcohol and drugs are believed to have been a factor in a significant percentage of the deaths Professionals offer all manner of hypotheses disintegration of the family proliferation of violence sex and drug use on television and in the movies fear of nuclear war The teenagers themselves have no ready answers At KIDS their stories usually are not of unloving parents brutality or poverty though there are many about broken families Mostly they speak of the traumas of growing up  of poor grades unpopularity lack of selfesteem strict homes While their parents and grandparents also knew these pains the difference today is that drugs are easily available At some point someone who seemed to the children selfconfident offered them something that made them feel better too I used to look at those people at school and think I want to be happy like them  says Jason When I drank everything felt easier Drugs produce a chemical high It feels good says Dr Newton But the high is so bright and shimmering it makes regular life look gray so they become more and more attracted to and reliant on drugs to feel good THE DAY A TEENAGER comes to KIDS for a diagnosis is the start of treatment No time to call friends stash drugs or reconsider From that moment until the Phase 1 is completed a newcomer is never left alone not even to go the bathroom or to shower An oldcomer is a constant handtobelt escort a reminder that a newcomer cannot be trusted And yet the first is the loneliest phase of treatment Though crowded by other clients other families the staff the teenager is isolated  from his own family the people once considered friends the familiar drugs There are no distractions The walls are bare but for selfhelp posters The chairs are hard blue plastic Music is forbidden as is cigarette smoking even socializing Janice is in Phase 1 still resisting acknowledgment of the way drugs changed her from an honor student gifted in music to a liar a runaway and an addict As with most others she had no drug of choice her only preference was for what was available I just want to crawl into a ball she says clenching her fists and staring at the floor I dont want to share how I feel because I dont want to admit to myself what I did Oh no you dont says June a staff memberWere not going to let you off that easy Other kids wave their hands competing to be called on to urge Janice to get straight Tears streaming Janice finally recounts lying in a ratinfested garage doing drugs with her boyfriend and then losing her virginity to him I just wanted to be serene she says I just wanted to be liked I hurt inside so much When Janice finishes her story the rest of the kids shout Love you a ritual after anyone talks in therapy Love you Paula the group says in unison after Paula admits once combining pills and hard alcohol in a suicide attempt Paula is in the first phase of treatment So are her 19yearold sister Lynn and her 17yearold brother Paul There are several sibling groups in the program KIDS demands family participation partly to prevent brothers and sisters from following the same destructive life style Twice a week at open meetings the families sit on one side of the room facing the teenagers There is no one type of parent as there is no one type of teenager in KIDS For hours they listen to public confessions by their children If their son or daughter has not yet earned the right to talk privately with them  a privilege gained in Phase 1 by demonstrating effort they must speak publicly across the room Often what parents tell their troubled youngsters is as painful as what they are told I feel like Im living on a detour Sues mother says I feel like the angel of death is at our door Once a youngster earns talk he or she has 5 to 10 minutes with the family after the meeting to speak and hold hands It is then that a child must tell the family all the ways drugs ruined a young life I sold my body for drugs and I pushed you away when you tried to help me Paula says sobbing and clutching her mothers hands I dont want to push you away I didnt think I deserved your love But I want to get well Mommy I want to come home If she continues to be this revealing Paula may advance to the second phase This step up when a youngster can go back home is one of the programs most emotional moments At the Monday and Friday night meetings in front of peers and their families the teenager rushes across the room and into his familys arms shouting Coming home A few weeks ago it was Michaels chance to embrace his parents with those words I feel like Ive given birth again said his tearful mother cupping his face That night Michael slept in his own home for the first time in weeks and began to rebuild the family he almost destroyed In the next two phases the teenagers return to school or work and face the outside pressure that has already stolen precious time from them They begin to socialize with straight friends and family Still they must report back to the center for continued treatment The recovery is still incomplete Sometimes a teenager cops out goes back to drugs or runs away If he or she returns to KIDS it is usually to Phase 1 The initial fee of 7200 which often is partly paid by a scholarship covers the teenager for as long as treatment takes  the average time is 12 to 14 months according to Dr Newton  including a refresher if needed sometime after graduation DANIELLE REACHED Phase 4 went back to work and pretty soon was smoking cigarettes and hanging out with the people who had introduced her to drugs I still wanted their approval she says It was so confusing She started at the beginning again and has worked her way up to Phase 2 The last bridge before returning fully to society is Phase 5 A client no longer takes home newcomers has an individualized schedule at KIDS and helps staff Graduates say it is a tangle of fear and anticipation Celeste is still a few weeks away from entering the fifth phase When she leaves KIDS at night she still takes home a newcomer a reminder of where she was just a few months ago Her charge now is Paula Sometimes I dont want to talk anymore says Paula as they get ready for bed Sometimes I dont even believe Im there There were so many times I thought of copping out says Celeste I resisted everything I kept to myself in group Then I started to realize the person I became on drugs and I saw that I couldnt give up or Id be that again I still feel like Im out of control says Paula like Ill never get well When the lights are turned off Celeste wedges her bed in the doorway to keep Paula from leaving unnoticed The nights now says Celeste are filled with dreams and hope For Paula huddled beside her in a sleeping bag they are still terribly frightening and lonely
NEW WAY TO GAUGE FETAL HEATLH,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/nyregion/new-way-to-gauge-fetal-heatlh.html,LEAD SOON after learning she was pregnant Susan who is 35 years old made an appointment for an amniocentesis to check her developing fetus for Downs syndrome and other genetic abnormalities associated with older maternal age SOON after learning she was pregnant Susan who is 35 years old made an appointment for an amniocentesis to check her developing fetus for Downs syndrome and other genetic abnormalities associated with older maternal age The appointment was made for her 16th week of pregnancy the earliest an amniocentesis can be performed But then Susan a businesswoman from Fairfield heard about a new method of prenatal diagnosis that can be done at only nine weeks of gestation YaleNew Haven Hospital is one of seven medical centers in the United States participating in a collaborative study to examine the risks and accuracy of a new procedure called chorionic villus sampling Twentynine other hospitals in the country perform the procedure Like amniocentesis chorionic villus sampling is performed with ultrasound guidance Instead of extracting amniotic fluid a small sampling of the developing placenta is extracted for genetic analysis Both methods check the number of chromosomes found in sample cells An extra chromosome signifies an abnormality Like amniocentesis the procedure can be used to screen for genetically caused diseases like sicklecell anemia muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis Tests to determine a specific problem are done only if there is a history of genetic problems in the family of either parenttobe The sex of the fetus can be determined from the procedure as can be done with amniocentesis The risk of fetal injury or miscarriage caused by the new procedure has not been scientifically established and is not expected to be known until sometime after the end of the collaborative study next year But it is estimated to be 2 percent according to Dr Maurice Mahoney professor of genetics who is the head of the study at YaleNew Haven The miscarriage risk from amniocentesis has been determined to be onehalf percent or four times less Susan who was in her ninth week of pregnancy canceled her amniocentesis appointment and booked one for a chorionic villus sampling the next morning She said she thought the estimated 2 percent miscarriage risk was small enough especially when considering the advantage of the earlier diagnosis The results of a chorionic villus sampling are available at two and a half or three months of pregnancy The results of an amniocentesis cannot be determined until four and a half or five months of gestation By then many women have already felt signs of life I felt the urgency to know right away that my baby was OK said Susan My emotional attachment was growing day by day and week by week I had an abortion 10 years ago and I cant imagine going through that again The chorionic villus sampling takes about 10 or 15 minutes said Dr Mahoney The common method of entering the uterus is transcervical A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into the vagina by a physician who guides it to the uterus by watching an ultrasound screen The catheter through suction takes a tiny sample of chorionic villi tissue which is part of the developing placenta The procedure can be uncomfortable and slight bleeding can occur because the cervix is clamped Both side effects usually are temporary Susan found the procedure to be relatively painless causing her only a slight pinching she said She said she was extremely uncomfortable from the pressure of her full bladder which is required for an ultrasound scan at nine weeks After she emptied her bladder she felt fine In some cases because of fetal position the sample is drawn by a needle inserted through the abdominal wall One purpose of the study is to determine which method of retrieval is easier and safer The transabdominal method is the only one used in amniocentesis It takes two or three weeks to make a culture of amniotic fluid cells and analyze them genetically It takes only six days to get results from the chorionic villus sampling because no culture is necessary The timing factor of CVS is its major benefit said Dr Mahoney One doesnt have to withhold commitment to a pregnancy as long There is more privacy for the woman if information about her pregnancy is available earlier And if the abortion option is considered it is easier to do in the first trimester than in the second The procedure was first performed in Denmark in the 1960s and later developed successfully in China in the early 1970s and in the Soviet Union in the late 1970s Since then the procedure has been used in Britain and Italy in a big way said Dr Mahoney YaleNew Haven began performing the procedure about three years ago and has screened 350 women The principal instruments used to draw a chorionic villi sample a catheter or needle are considered to be investigational devices by the Food and Drug Administration The agency is awaiting the results of the collaborative study before approving the instruments for general obstetrical use Because the procedure still is being investigated it makes many people a little leery said Dr Murray Master an obstetriciangynecologist at the Womans Medical Group in Bridgeport and Trumbull We let older patients know that a new diagnostic procedure is available said Dr Master But when people hear there is increased risk of a miscarriage most people prefer to wait for an amniocentesis Amniocentesis has proved to be a relatively safe and highly reliable procedure according to Dr Mahoney It was developed in the United States in the early 1960s to examine the Rh factor of the fetus By the late 1960s its use was expanded to include fetal chromosome analysis In Dr Mahoneys opinion the 2 percent miscarriage risk attributed to chorionic villus sampling is overstated He said he believes the study will show it is closer to 1 percent which is still twice that of amniocentesis YaleNew Haven is the only hospital in the state where chorionic villus sampling is performed The University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington plans to offer it within six months About two thirds of the women who undergo the procedure at YaleNew Haven want to know the sex of the fetus once it is established all is well Susans baby due in August passed the test Its a girl
"VIEWS ON CONSTITUTION: PROMISES KEPT, MILES TO GO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/26/us/views-on-constitution-promises-kept-miles-to-go.html,Most Americans say the Constitution has accomplished the bulk of its aims from unifying a nation of separate states to providing defense and domestic tranquility a New York TimesCBS News Poll shows but a majority say the Constitution has done a poor job of treating all people equally Americans now support pretty much the same structure the Framers created in sessions that began 200 years ago yesterday the poll showed But their answers indicated that they would prefer a somewhat weaker central government than the one that has evolved and would reject both the Electoral College and life tenure for Supreme Court justices But in a sharp contrast to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood A Marshalls recent statement that the Founding Fathers sacrificed moral values for selfinterest the poll found 88 percent saying that the Framers main goal was to insure liberty while only 11 percent said their purpose had been protecting their states economic interests The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points Influences Subtle and Deep The poll taken by telephone was conducted May 1114 in advance of the bicentennial ceremonies and sought to measure the views of the 1254 respondents on the success of the Constitution and on what sort of governmental structures and mechanisms they would prefer asking in modern terms the sort of questions that a poll conducted 200 years ago might have posed The answers of course are influenced by the existence of the Constitution itself and years of education supporting its approaches as the best ones Although polls like this were unknown for nearly threefourths of the Constitutions history the extensive debates in the press at the time gave the Framers considerable information about public opinion points they often used in argument For example the ineffectiveness of the unicameral Federal legislature under the Articles of Confederation was so amply documented that the demand for a bicameral Congress was virtually universal historians say In the current poll 72 percent of Americans agreed that both a House and Senate were necessary Blacks Favor Stronger Center One key difference is that 200 years ago the views of women and blacks were not considered The poll included the opinions of both groups finding that women differ little from men on most questions but blacks tend to favor a stronger central government than whites and are more critical of the Governments accomplishments in promoting equality In an attempt to gauge the Constitutions overall effectiveness the poll paraphrased the principal elements of its Preamble and asked whether respondents thought the Government established under the Constitution had done a good or bad job on that point Large majorities said the Government has done a good job in providing for the national defense in making Americans think of themselves as one nation and in keeping life peaceful and free from disturbance But just 53 percent said the Government has done a good job in establishing a fair system of justice while 37 percent said it has done a bad job and 10 percent had no answer A Goal Not Yet Realized An even more negative note was a judgment by 51 percent of the respondents that the Government has done a bad job in treating all people equally  the modern corollary according to Paul A Freund the Harvard constitutional scholar of the Preambles pledge to promote the general welfare Only 41 percent said it has done a good job at that Among blacks 63 percent said the United States had failed to provide equality while 31 percent said it had succeeded Moreover 49 percent of all those polled said the Constitution usually protects only people who have money while 44 percent disagreed Those negative views parallel Justice Marshalls recent criticism as well as others For example in a speech at Columbia Universi last week A Leon Higginbotham a Federal appeals judge called the Constitution as written meaningless to blacks The institution that in recent years has often been at the center of disputes over equality the Supreme Court seemed to generate more unease than other branches Judicial Review Is Opposed Nearly a third of Americans said they opposed judicial review the Supreme Courts power to invalidate actions of other branches as unconstitutional saying they preferred that the executive and legislative branches check themselves Historians suggest that view is closer to that of the Founding Fathers Moreover just 8 percent of Americans said the court should be the most powerful of the three branches compared with 20 percent who said the President should be and 28 percent who chose Congress Forty percent said all three should be equal almost equal to the 44 percent who remembered their school days lesson that the Framers intent was that all three are supposed to be equal Another negative view of the Court appeared to be reflected in the fact that only 16 percent of the public favored life tenure for justices as the Constitution provides while 80 percent said justices should serve for a specific term Fortyfive percent wanted that term to be less than 10 years Even when the issue was raised again with life tenure explained as providing independence from political pressures only 35 percent favored life tenure while 52 percent opposed it One Scholar Is Not Surprised Laurence H Tribe professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard University said he was not surprised by Americans disapproval of life tenure He said Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and others undermine the Court by vague suggestions that the Court should be disobeyed when one disagrees with it On the left he said some voices have criticized the Constitution as interpreted by the Court as irrelevant and worse over its history When the Constitution was debated the critical argument was not about equality but rather about how to divide power between the Federal and state governments and within the Federal Government The Grand Compromise of the Philadelphia Convention was to establish two coequal houses one the Senate accorded even the smallest state the same two votes to be wielded by the largest while the House was based on population Although the chambers in fact remain theoretically equal in power the poll showed more than half of todays Americans believe the Senate is more powerful possibly because Senators serve sixyear terms compared with two years for Representatives or perhaps because Senators enjoy more visibility on television Still more than half of Americans appear to believe that the House is more reflective of popular will and the Senate a more deliberative body  exactly the intention of the Framers George Washington explained the need for a Senate to Thomas Jefferson in this way We pour legislation into the Senatorial saucer to cool it Electoral College Is Disliked A key change respondents said they wanted in the Constitution was the abolition of the Electoral College The institution was set up at a time when there was no television radio or other national mediand voters had no knowledge of candidates outside their immediate area Moreover there were no real national parties until well into the 1830s Accordingly electing a trusted elector known to be informed and cosmopolitan to journey to a central location and meet with others like him in order to choose a leader made considerable sense Although the institution still makes sense to big states such as New York and California because its winnertakeall aspect magnifies their influence Americans now overwhelmingly want the system changed The poll indicated 61 percent would favor an amendment eliminating the electoral college while 33 percent would oppose such an initiative Even the New Yorkers and the Californians combined supported abolition by 53 to 39 percent The popular satisfaction with the Constitution was also reflected in the fact that only 20 percent said it was too hard to amend it and only 11 percent could suggest an amendment they wanted made That response follows a general reluctance to modify or add to the original document In 200 years there have been just 26 amendments the last in 1971 For a Balanced Budget But when asked specifically about several possible amendments majorities responded favorably and not merely on the issues of the Electoral College and judicial tenure Eightyfive percent favored an amendment requiring Washington to balance the budget and 75 percent supported the defeated Equal Rights Amendment up sharply from 54 percent in January 1982 when it was still struggling for ratification And 69 percent favored an amendment to allow organized prayer in schools People were equally divided on an amendment that would require Federal state and local governments to conduct all their business in English with 47 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed Majorities of people under 45 years of age blacks and liberals were opposed to this amendment But there was a decisive rejection of the idea that a constitutional amendment should prohibit all abortions Just 25 percent supported it while 69 percent were opposed Skepticism on Central Power A plurality of Americans today 47 percent said the balance between state and Federal power is about right but 39 percent said the Federal Government has too much power Only 5 percent said the states have too much power Ironically many Americans wanted the Federal Government to take responsibility for things that originally would have fallen under state jurisdiction Majorities favored having one national policy for registration and voting 64 percent setting penalties for murder 62 percent establishing factory safety standards 65 percent and setting minimum wages 51 percent But majorities did want states to make their own rules on selecting public school textbooks 61 percent and setting speed limits 56 percent How the Poll Was Taken The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted May 11 through 14 with 1254 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example for blacks it is plus or minus 10 percentage points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll Setting the Rules Federalism Today Should there be one national policy set by the Federal Government or should the 50 states make their own rules    Federal States    in controlling pollution 49 46    in setting penalties for murder 62 34    on the issue of registration and voting 64 31    in selecting textbooks in public schools 35 61    in setting minimum wages 51 45    in establishing safety standards in factories 65 31    in setting highway speed limits 42 56 Based on 1254 telephone interviews conducted May 1114 Those with no opinion are not shown
REPUBLICANS SEE MARCH 8 VOTING AS OPPORTUNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/27/us/republicans-see-march-8-voting-as-opportunity.html,Senator Bob Dole of Kansas speaking to Georgia Republicans in Savannah last week took a swipe at Senator Sam Nunn saying that if the Georgia Democrat wanted to conduct foreign policy then he should suit up and run for President Republicans cheered Mr Doles jab at their states most popular politician for trying to hold President Reagan to a strict interpretation of the 1972 treaty limiting systems to defend against missile attack But the last thing Southern Republicans want to see is Mr Nunn running for President Republican strategists say a Nunn candidacy could spoil their hopes of turning the Souths Presidential primaries to their advantage next year Mr Nunn a favorite among conservative Democrats says he will decide by this fall whether to enter the Presidential competition If he stays out of the race Republicans say they expect to reap most of the benefits of the Souths regional primary which was a creation of the regions Democratic legislatures and Governors bent on increasing their regions influence in Presidential politics 30 of Delegates at Stake Fourteen Southern and adjacent states along with a few states in other parts of the country will hold Presidential primaries on March 8 More than 30 percent of each partys total national convention delegates will be chosen on that day The Republican theory is this the publicity focused on the South will heighten interest in the campaign and underscore the differences between the two parties Voters will look at a Presidential field where most of the Democratic candidates are to the left of center and all the Republicans to the right Many conservative Democrats and independents will find the Republicans more to their liking Of course nobody knows or even has an informed estimate how many Southerners will vote in Republican primaries Democratic primaries or in neither One hint however came from the most recent New York TimesCBS News Poll which showed that 29 percent of registered voters in those states said they voted in Republican primaries as against 55 percent who said they vote in Democratic primaries But the Republicans hope the comparison of the two fields will work to their advantage And the more white Southerners who cast Republican ballots party strategists say the better the prospects of a liberal Democrat such as the Rev Jesse Jackson doing well in the Democratic voting on March 8 which has been dubbed Super Tuesday The Republican side of Super Tuesday is going to be the real game said Marty Connors secretary of the Southern Republican Exchange a policy group formed by four Southern governors to help Republicans capitalize on the voting that day If Republicans are successful in pulling a reasonable number of conservatives out of the Democratic primaries he said I think we can give a boost to the Democrats most liberal candidate Thats the Super Tuesday result we want to see Democrats are concerned enough about the Republican strategy that the Democratic Leadership Council a group of party centrists has scheduled a Super Tuesday Summit in Atlanta on June 22 to discuss ways to increase voter turnout especially among conservative Democrats in the primaries Republicans say it is to their advantage that eight Southern states including Georgia Alabama and Texas do not require voters to register by party allowing them to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary North Carolina Republicans have proposed changing their party rules to eliminate the party registration requirement in their primary Unless someone like Mr Nunn enters the race predicted Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia the Democrats will be offering a field of candidates who by Southern standards are close to European socialists Republicans are assuming that Southern voters feel as strongly as they do about such issues as aid to the Nicaraguan rebels known as contras and a proposed missile defense shield But the results of a recent opinion poll of Southerners conducted by The Atlanta Journal and Constitution suggest that is not the case Most people in that survey said they were more concerned about drunken driving drug abuse and education than they were about abortion school prayer and the death penalty The issues they were least concerned about included contra aid and the antimissile program The regional primary is such a wild card that no one is certain what effects it will have on the nomination battles in the two parties I think its unknowable said Mr Gingrich a leading conservative strategist who is supporting the Presidential campaign of Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York Vice President Bush is acknowledged to be well ahead of any of his Republican rivals in the South But Mr Kemp and the Rev Pat Robertson have considerable strength in some states Among states that are tentatively scheduled to hold primaries on March 8 are Texas Oklahoma Louisiana Arkansas Missouri Mississippi Alabama Tennessee Kentucky Florida Georgia North Carolina Virginia Maryland Massachusetts and Rhode Island In addition delegates are to be chosen at voter caucuses in Hawaii Idaho Nevada Washington and American Samoa
EXPANDING POWER FOR INDIAN WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/28/garden/expanding-power-for-indian-women.html,Wilma P Mankiller the 41yearold principal chief of the Cherokee nation is used to comments about her name Most feminists would love to have a name like Mankiller she said It fits my work real well and Ive broken new ground for women Ms Mankiller who is the first woman to serve as chief of a major American Indian group faces a new challenge June 20 when she will seek election to that post for the first time Elected deputy chief in 1983 she succeeded Ross Swimmer as principal chief when he became director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Now she manages 1000 tribal government employees and a budget of 47 million for the 75000member Cherokee nation in Oklahoma Registration for the election is at a record level and Ms Mankillers opponents all are men although one slate includes a woman Barbara StarrScott running for deputy chief The campaign has been a difficult one although Ms Mankiller appears to be leading from informal polls and telephone canvassing The central issue is whether or not gender has anything to do with leadership she said Of the 50 candidates for the Cherokee Tribal Council 13 are women 3 of the present 15 members of the council are women and women are represented at the highest levels of Cherokee government It has taken Cherokee women 15 years to achieve such participation in tribal government according to Ms Mankiller Before whites arrived she said the women determined the qualifications and chose the candidates for chief Shifts between modernity and tradition are built into the lives of American Indian women And when talk turns to relationships between men and women for example Navajo women tell a story from their genesis myth In the story just as the Navajo people are about to leap from the underworld onto the earths surface the men and women quarrel and separate At first all goes well for each side but soon crops begin to fail some men become homosexual and some women give birth to deformed babies Finally the two sexes decide they cannot live without each other and united the people emerge into the outer world Navajo women laugh at the tale which suggests how men and women need each other equally But the laughter stops when the women assess their quest for equality in the modern world American Indian women have seen progress but also poverty and widespread alcoholism and unemployment especially among their men Daunting cultural barriers keep them behind their white counterparts in all areas economic social and educational From tribe to tribe and even within tribes the progress made by American Indian women has been as varied as the womens concerns At a recent meeting in the Office of Navajo Women in Window Rock Ariz issues discussed included a daycare service for Federal and tribal government workers in town family violence and the need for selfservice laundries in outlying areas Women have advanced steadily within tribal government generally Last December Verna Williamson 36 was the first woman elected governor of Isleta Pueblo on Albuquerques southern edge The newly elected Navajo tribal chairman Peter MacDonald named Loyce Phoenix 37 a nurse and health administrator as his chief of staff She is the first woman to fill that position for the Navajos the nations largest Indian group with 146000 members The previous tribal chairman Peterson Zah had appointed Claudeen Arthur a Navajo lawyer as the tribes Attorney General the first woman in that position In last Novembers Navajo elections women took 72 of 327 local offices the most since modern tribal government was instituted in the 1920s Reviewing these signs of progress Ms Arthur noted that the Navajo nation resembles an underdeveloped country characterized by small steps rather than giant strides And Ms Mankiller said There has been a revitalization of the role of women in the Cherokee nation though Im not sure if its a movement American Indian women say they have advanced in recent years partly because of expanded educational opportunities In the Navajo tribal scholarship program for example which includes some higher education 62 percent of the students are women They complete their programs quickly because of pressure to get jobs and support their families or supplement the family income Spiritual and cultural forces are also prompting change This is all in the prophesies that the spirit of the woman is emerging and is a strong force right now said Avis Archambault whose parents came from the Lakota and Gros Ventre tribes of Montana and who is a social worker in the Phoenix Indian Center As a Navajo proverb puts it What comes around goes around What is coming around for many of these women is the return of the power they had before reorganization of American Indian life Some tribes like the Pueblo and Navajo retain their societies matriarchal structures however women still own their own homes land and livestock American Indian women acknowledge that tradition has undercut their power and position in some cases Religious considerations for example make family planning and abortion difficult for Navajo women even to discuss When the Isleta tribal council sought to bar Ms Williamsons election as governor it contended that putting a woman in the job would violate religious custom At the same time it is by upholding tradition that American Indian women seem to have preserved a tribal life despite the devastations of alcoholism If it wasnt for the women their intestinal fortitude in keeping our traditions going we would have disbanded as a tribe a long time ago said Alfred Benalli a Navajo who grew up in Jemez Pueblo NM and who now directs an alcoholism program for five pueblos in New Mexico Gloria Duus founding director of the Office of Navajo Women noted that a traditional womens craft weaving may be a key to economic advancement for the Navajos if the tribe can help them market their products She also suggested that Navajo women can capitalize on the current widespread interest in foods and other products grown in the wild One of the biggest problems is that we need to really trust our own selves and our own thinking Ms Mankiller said and not allow others to convince us that our thoughts ideas and plans and visions arent valid

Suit Seeks to Ban a Defoliant,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/30/us/afl-cio-suit-seeks-to-ban-a-defoliant.html,The AFLCIO and the Natural Resources Defense Council today asked a Federal appeals court to immediately stop fruit and vegetable growers in the Northwest from using a popular defoliant that Federal scientists consider a threat to human health The Environmental Protection Agency banned the defoliant dinoseb last October after new scientific studies reported it caused a number of severe health disorders in laboratory animals including sterility and birth defects The environmental agency said at that time tens of thousands of farm workers who sprayed the chemical were in danger especially women of childbearing age But in March the environmental agency modified its decision to allow limited use of the chemical after growers of peas and lentils in Idaho and Washington asserted that no other defoliant worked so well to control weeds and that without dinoseb their crops would be severely damaged Then earlier this month Federal District Judge James A Redden in Portland Ore ruled that growers of beans cucumbers raspberries and other crops in Oregon as well as Idaho and Washington could also use the chemical The fight over dinoseb is another illustration of the problems the EPA is having in regulating chemicals that farmers find valuable and scientists consider hazardous The appeal of Judge Reddens decision was taken today to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit It seeks to reverse the decision as well as force the Environmental Protection Agency to abide by its original decision to ban the use of the chemical A group of farm workers joined the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and the Natural Resources Defense Council in the appeal The AFLCIO and the defense council said they were taking the action because neither the Department of Justice nor the Environmental Protection Agency was acting quickly enough to appeal the decision in Oregon and prevent thousands of farm workers from being exposed to the defoliant In seeking the emergency ban were acting where the Government should have acted to protect public health said Albert H Meyerhoff an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council In seeking a total ban of dinoseb on the ground it is unsafe the lawsuit cited a decision by the environmental agency in March to allow the growers of lentils and peas to use dinoseb as long as they prohibited female farm workers from handling the chemical Judge Redden also included this restriction in his decision to allow other farmers to apply dinoseb Attorneys for the labor and environmental groups called the decision unconstitutional sex discrimination Whats unique here is that instead of banning a pesticide the EPA and the court are banning women who are endangered by the pesticide said Ralph Lightstone a lawyer with the California Rural Legal Assistance a federally financed lawyers group that represents farm workers Lawyers at the environmental agency and the Justice Department said they would not comment on the case while it was still in the courts The battle over dinoseb reached Capitol Hill earlier this week when Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin charged that the agency and the Justice Department allowed the continued use of dinoseb because of pressure from agricultural interests Because of the Department of Justice inaction dinoseb can now be used freely in the Northwest causing fetal deaths deformed children and spontaneous abortions said Senator Proxmire in a letter to the Edwin Meese 3d the Attorney General William Prendergast a member of the Congressional liason staff at the EPA said today that his office had received letters and calls from around the nation asking the agency to reverse the October ban on dinoseb There was pressure he said but it didnt affect what the administrator did
THIRD WORLD NATIONS FINALLY EMBRACING POPULATION CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/weekinreview/third-world-nations-finally-embracing-population-control.html,LEAD SOMETIMErrxh soon the worlds five billionth inhabitant will be born and by the turn of the century Number six billion will arrive SOMETIMErrxh soon the worlds five billionth inhabitant will be born and by the turn of the century Number six billion will arrive According to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which issued those and other projections in a report this month most of the growth is in the countries least able to accommodate it In subSaharan Africa the rate of growth continues to rise  in contrast to most other poor areas of the world  and is outstripping increases in food production Familyplanning programs are beginning to overcome decades of resistance in many thirdworld countries however Following are comments made by Dr Nafis Sadik the executive director of the population fund in an interview with Ethan Schwartz of the United Nations bureau of The New York Times and a report on populationcontrol initiatives in the third world undertaken by the Rockefeller Foundation Question How have developing countries attitudes toward family planning evolved since the fund was established in 1969 Answer In 1974 at the Bucharest conference there was a lot of antagonism from the developing countries But in 1984 at the Mexico conference you noted that every developing country talked about the importance of taking account of population factors and this was regardless of ideology of culture of religion    We have been inundated with requests from African countries to help them with population policies  31 country programs  and this has never happened to us before This realization has been dramatic in the last two or three years  the change in Tanzania the change in Malawi the change in Zambia in Senegal In Nigeria where we couldnt get a national statement on population they now have the bestdrafted population policy which will be issued as a cabinet directive very soon Q You have spoken often about the need to direct family planning efforts toward women Why do you stress that A My own personal view is that since women have children we should try to give them the most effective contraception techniques Many womens groups get very upset with that  they think male responsibility is understated  but in the end I think it has to be the woman that makes the final decision I think the conditioning factors for acceptance of family planning and consequently the decline in birth rates are educational levels for women and participation of women outside of the home    More than anywhere else this is the case of Kerala State in India which has a very high acceptance of family planning  40 percent compared to 14 or 15 percent in the rest of India The major difference in Kerala is the high level of literacy among women and employment outside the home Most Kerala women work outside of home and many are entrepreneurs And within Kerala there is the fishermens group where literacy rates for women are very low and there you see the birth rate is quite high Q As a woman from an Islamic country Pakistan have you found it difficult to deal with Islamic or other conservative governments What is the Islamic attitude toward birth control A As far as governments are concerned I dont think Ive had any problems dealing with even the most conservative such as Saudi Arabia or Oman I think  that if you hold a certain position or have a certain role the barriers that exist let us say for other women do not seem to apply to you As far as Islam and Moslem countries are concerned there is no doubt that women in the Moslem countries in general seem to have a lower participation in employment outside the home less opportunity to develop themselves  and so there are higher birth rates There are exceptions like Tunisia Algeria and Indonesia which are changing dramatically In Islam itself there is nothing against family planning or birth control Ive been commissioning some studies on family planning and Islam and we have the first draft of a book weve commissioned which Ive had reviewed by a group of Islamic scholars Islam is much more liberal than Catholicism In Catholicism abstinence is the only method that is really allowed In this review of Islamic teaching it would seem that methods for preventing births whatever they are are permissible There is some discussion of whether sterilization is or not but that is still being reviewed One of the theologians even indicated abortion was legal in Islam Q The United States has withheld its contributions to the population fund to protest support for programs in China contending that these involved coerced abortion Has this hurt the fund A In 1987 we had a rallying  a show of support from other donors an increase of about 10 percent from other donors  but that is not to say we cannot use more We would have done a lot more in subSaharan Africa if we had received more resources We had to reduce our programs in all the other regions of the world Q What population trends do you predict for the next century A I dont think we are going toward doomsday The lesson we have learned is that something we thought was difficult to do has been done in a number of countries World population growth rates have gone down from 1969 to now from about 2 percent to 167 percent and will go down to 15 percent by the end of the century     In the developing regions they have gone down from 25 to 2 percent between 1970 and 1985 Growth rates have only gone up in one region subSaharan Africa from about 27 percent in 1975 to about 32 percent But all the major countries in Africa are embarking on national programs so population growth will come down
EXPLORING THE KINGDOM OF AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/magazine/exploring-the-kingdom-of-aids.html,I SPENT A MONTH recently in the imaginary kingdom of AIDS tracking what experts say is the designated future of the disease its coming assault upon the heterosexual community What I was looking at was the behavior of heterosexuals surrounded by the same storm warnings yet acting in a wide variety of ways Since it is primarily contracted through sex and the use of drugs two activities associated with both desire and free will acquired immune deficiency syndrome tests us as no disease ever has It is the first plague in the history of mankind whose regulation is entirely dependent upon our knowing behavior Threatened or unthreatened by the disease we find ourselves displayed with embarrassing clarity in the searchlight AIDS throws on our attitudes and feelings As a married man with three sons and a daughter I thought I was openminded accepting of diversity hopeful the near future would bring a cure for something I didnt understand I discovered that where AIDS is concerned I was insatiably curious sexually morally ambivalent and politically angry Meanwhile in the imaginary AIDS kingdom I found moods ranging from panic to defiance to a kind of jubilant apathy And over everything hung a blanket of confusion the heavy fog in the AIDS kingdom that will not blow away Why would people given the same facts and information and theories respond so differently TWO GLAMOROUS women spoke heatedly intimately They are very close to each other and remarkably alike both bicoastal both fashionably dressed At first glance the principal difference between them is age a quartercentury ago the older one had given birth to the younger How long have you known him the mother asked Not long the daughter answered Maybe two months Astonishing What possesses you to get married so soon Mother hell make a perfect first husband What Arent you planning for the rest of your life here Maybe hell outgrow me maybe Ill outgrow him but at the moment this seems a very constructive move Mother  A very constructive move  the mother mimicked The sheer pragmatism stuns me Come on now why are you doing this Frankly Mother I dont want to stay in the singles stream Im afraid I might get AIDS As the daughter sizes up her future she is better off throwing part of her life away on someone she does not love rather than throwing her entire life away on someone else she may sleep with but also not love If a chance rendezvous can be fatal the relationship between sex and death anciently understood in art and ritual is restored In the kingdom of AIDS a penis itself often likened to a sword in folk tales again becomes a deadly weapon This young woman tries to protect herself by a hasty marriage Another an elegant divorced woman of 41 celebrated for her beauty and passion swore herself to celibacy when her relationship with a financier broke up six months ago It is agony she said but I may never share my bed again with anyone Watching the fear rise among many whose behavior is not generally considered to be risky  that is among heterosexual men who do not use drugs and among women who are neither drug users nor involved with bisexual men  I have been struck by a fear of my own that the panic may so far outstrip the disease as to be ludicrous The danger is that when the panic is finally recognized as silly sensible precaution will disappear along with unreasonable fear Is the panic justified In interviews with more than 100 New Yorkers many of whom had friends with AIDS I have not heard of a single case where the disease was passed sexually by one nondrugusing untransfused heterosexual to another Most Americans who will have AIDS in 1991 are among the estimated 15 million already infected with the virus carrying around a live epidemiological bullet in their sexual organs and bloodstreams More than 90 percent of the 35000 AIDS victims in the United States thus far have been men On the other hand  AIDS has more hands than an orgy  the HIV virus does take all that time to incubate up to five years perhaps longer As in Schnitzlers play La Ronde a man sleeps with a woman who sleeps with another man who sleeps with another woman    Somewhere in that circle may be a bisexual or an intravenous drug user Ratios can shift In central Africa the disease has spread primarily among heterosexuals and slightly more women than men have it Who can say conclusively the panic is not justified And with AIDS expectation is all since our perception of the threat presumably determines our behavior perhaps only an exaggerated depiction of the danger AIDS now poses for heterosexuals will prevent that worstcase scenario from ultimately becoming the reality It seems paradoxical but the result is we are being warned that we are all bombs and some of our fuses have been lighted A 38YEAROLD WOMAN IN publishing broke off a lengthy relationship last summer For months she didnt allow herself to have a date Finally her old boyfriend from college freshly divorced in Darien Conn asked to take her to dinner Hes still a drip she told me but it was safe psychologically for me so I went Well I brought him back to the apartment and we made love Then were lying there you know right afterward and he says to me Youre friends with a lot of people in show business arent you Darien It was my own fault So I say I guess I know a few Whereupon he props himself up rather starchily on one elbow and says I suppose Id better start to worry about AIDS now hadnt I Right after making love There Id been flattered he wanted me after all these years and suddenly he sees me as his executioner Sex is always so fraught with possibilities for humiliation anyway Now were being taught that its also Russian roulette Fear guilt hostility violent fantasies rage the life impulse or a death wish  the dynamics of peoples responses to AIDS often mirror their feelings about sex For those scared by sex AIDS is the penalty for feeling sexual in the first place Sex is associated with aggression and aggression must be punished What more effective punishment than AIDS itself the ultimate castration A divorced 40yearold man told me he would never again sleep with a woman I havent checked out thoroughly He might have been talking about a new car Men and women are acting more afraid of one another than ever before in this century The ease with which people began to treat each other during the 1960s is vanishing Men and women talk of one another almost as if two separate races are involved Im your total yuppie profile from the Ivy League education to the job to the expectations said a young woman Ill call Amy Flagg a show business executive not yet out of her 20s The spate of articles about AIDS had literally iced the passions of Amy and her friends Yesterday I was at lunch with another woman executive and two young TV writers wed like to do business with she continued Everybody had read at least two AIDS cover stories and was petrified What would a few months ago have been a slightly flirtatious occasion combined with business instead became this sober deadly consideration of something no one wanted to talk about yet couldnt stop thinking about You find out someone had a drug problem three years ago forget it A bisexual forget it forget it forget it Even if a guy you know is straight but is kind of promiscuous forget it The people I know arent yet taking the uh precautions when they do have sex I guess were all going to start soon God I wish I could have just one lunch in the Russian Tea Room where we talk about something else besides AIDS Herpes maybe Samantha Ellis as Ill call a 31yearold investment banker noted among her friends for both her independence and abandon was furious and herpes was part of the reason The medical profession cried wolf on herpes and the journalists tagged right along she said It turned out to be a hoax Why should we believe any of you now Frankly Im someone who adores lovemaking I think the enjoyment of ones sexuality is such a precious gift and attribute  like a flower blooming  that I bitterly resent anyone attempting to crush it I asked whether Samantha has changed the way she lives The stories had no effect on me until recently she said I just cant handle the idea of prophylactics Id have no hesitancy about buying them myself but Id find it difficult to ask someone to actually use them The injunction not to exchange bodily fluids not only denies a fundamental aspect of intercourse  since sex by definition involves the sharing of selves  but it also means that a newly formed couple must pause to negotiate a delicate pathway around infection Do you mind using a condom Oh ah do you happen to have any with you Have you ever been with an IV drug user Im a lot more careful now about sleeping with someone I think is bisexual says Samantha This is in a way a tyranny part of the inexorable return to conservatism Its so antithetical to intermingling so antidemocratic it destroys the integrity and openness achieved by the sexual revolution People are saying you should sleep only with your own kind Last year on a business trip to the Midwest Samantha met a stagehand she liked She brought him back to New York for a while We had a lot of fun and although this wasnt the point we broadened each others horizons He didnt have a habit but occasionally he shot drugs into his arm If I met him today I wouldnt sleep with him We never would have had the relationship I resent so much whats happening FOR THE LARGER community as for Samantha Ellis the holiday is over Doctors orders Whether the heterosexual citizenry is following the helpful hints to safer sex and longer life hints packaged like scouting handbooks on how to tie different kinds of knots few are unaware of a change in circumstance People who felt guilty about sex or about not enjoying it as much as they had been told in the previous two decades that they should have just quit They have the perfect excuse It used to be good for you like aerobics and Brussels sprouts goodbye to all that because now it is dangerous to your health like smoking and hang gliding The baby booms babies are supposed to turn back the clock never easy when the hands are racing forward as they tend to do at 21 The urges of youthful rebellion  young people pushing out against the limits set by their parents  are now directed to the sensible instead of the experimental The 45yearold former radicals are now expected to teach their children how to be reactionary What a frightful time to be young said a society lady known for her cosmopolitan views but celibate since she stopped living with someone last summer The new caring man and independent woman we heard so much about the lovers keeping their own apartments just in case uh something interesting turns up while youre away dear a little tentative shall we say exploration all that is out out out Two years ago when our gay friends were dying we thought real men not only didnt eat quiche they didnt get AIDS Now the campaign is on among us and we have all these grand New York matrons showing up at benefits puckering their lips to lecture gravely that it wont be possible to have anal intercourse anymore its passe my dear ca ne se fait plus as though mankind is being robbed of one of the wonders of the world the Pyramids are collapsing perhaps As for our friends the gays they are not so very gay anymore my dear nor so wild with abandon nor leading the charge anymore against established sexual practices They opened the door and rushed through And they felt the earliest warning signal I DECIDED TO LOOK DEEPER into the trenches of the imaginary AIDS kingdom the bars where young people go to make new acquaintances Dorrians Red Hand on Second Avenue has had a reputation as an easy place to find a pickup It became notorious one night last summer when Jennifer Dawn Levin met Robert E Chambers Jr there and the two left for a sexual encounter in Central Park that ended in Miss Levins death Preppies and junior yuppies still swagger around in Dorrians as if they owned the sexual turf but according to at least a dozen customers there is far less action than there was a year ago I wont sleep with anyone unless I really really know him said a slender young woman wearing huge gold earrings and a long black sweaterdress A young man in a crewneck sweater leaned against the bar watching her AIDS has me scared to death she added I always thought I could do anything now I know I cant I asked how she knew The media hype got me I guess I changed about a year and a half ago You didnt change that long ago said the man in the crewnecked sweater OK said the woman with the gold earrings but on my last experience I used a condom I remember Next time bring your own moron Three 24yearold men  call them Tom Dick and Harry  all described themselves as extremely worried about AIDS Two years out of college Tom is a buildingsupply salesman hoping to become a veterinarian Dick is a realestate salesman and Harry a medical student Of the three only Tom wore a condom the last time he had sex which was with a prostitute who made him use one Harry the medical student carries condoms with him all the time he just doesnt always use them Dick had bought some for the first time a few weeks earlier He had met a girl he knew he was going to sleep with on the second date so he made the purchase But his last previous experience before I met him was with an old girlfriend I figured I was safe so I didnt use a rubber Dick said What bothers me is this incubation period because two three and four years ago I was having sex with girls I didnt know at all As worried as I am he went on Im a young single male and Im going to be meeting people and picking them up Ill just have to be more careful The trouble with condoms Tom said they take the pleasure out They take some of the pleasure out but they beat dying Dick said You use a condom at first then later you can forget about them Right said Harry you get serious you throw away your rubbers At a table nearby three 23yearold women in advertising  let them be Alice Betty and Carol  worried about stopping AIDS without stopping sex They said Dorrians had changed and they had changed When 3 AM rolled around they no longer saw people leaving with somebody different every night One good thing about AIDS is it kind of wakes everybody up Alice said Its like Knock knock in there anybody home Time to take care of your life you know  Really Betty said I cant believe condoms are the final answer though I havent used a rubber in eight years not since my first experience when I was 15 Believe me I dont want to go through that again I used one once Alice said but I didnt like it Its like theres something between you and him some kind of barrier Carol said We all believe in precautions but we dont necessarily take them Carol said Like I know cigarettes are harmful and have killed a lot more people than AIDS but I havent stopped smoking them WHAT WILL MAKE people really take precautions And what is the degree of danger for heterosexuals anyway I asked Dr Mervyn F Silverman the former public health director for San Francisco and now president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research what level of concern he thought was appropriate among heterosexuals Today the amount of virus floating around available to heterosexuals is small he said but the paradox is we cant let ourselves think that way because if we operate on that premise well wake up one day with an overwhelming problem We walk a tightrope between ChickenLittletheskyisfalling and apathy Neither one is helpful But arent the specialists inevitably spreading not merely precaution but panic when they project a huge AIDS population in the near future Probably Dr Silverman said but just because theres no reason to panic doesnt mean theres no reason to be careful What I want most is for someone to say to me five years from now You were all wet AIDS never made a dent in the heterosexual community Itll mean we did our job I thought of Dr Silvermans paradox as I watched the scene in PJ Clarkes Though not a singles bar Clarkes appeals to many upscale New Yorkers with a variety of tastes Hey Im not going with anyone right now but condoms are not for me said Chuck a 25yearold stockbroker to his friend Steve If I do meet someone Ill probably end up just winging it Me too said Steve who is 24 I wing it Ive thought about condoms said Mariel a 20yearold college student but I always end up winging it myself Kevin a 24yearold insurance salesman who was the only black person in the group let his friends finish before saying anything The war stories have got to me he said I know a woman who was once married to an addict She left him six years ago but shes dying now A gay man I used to work with is already dead Ive been celibate for six months because of AIDS Im waiting until I meet someone Im really interested in Then Ill have to date for a while Then Ill use a condom What had really gotten to Kevin what had really made him change his behavior as he made clear was not press coverage but personal experience With AIDS killing two of his friends he was taking no chances Hey listen Chuck said motioning for another round of beers sex is the lifeblood of the nation I say go for it ha ha FREQUENTLY IN suburban bars even more than in New York City I heard the remark that we only go out with people we know As Samantha Ellis said AIDS has done away with the democratic element that the 60s introduced to sex Safe sex did not mean only condoms and spermicides it also meant staying within ones prescribed circle The old taboos against outsiders are coming back again now The problem is that safe sex is a contradiction in terms The familiar as happily married couples know can be filled with variation and the unexpected but if something is entirely and predictably safe with no element of adventure or the unknown its not very sexy If as a number of men and women on Long Island told me they now come to public places in prearranged groups and have resolved to meet new friends only in their churches and synagogues the choice of romantic partners is further restricted to members of ones own religion The political conservatism that swept the land in the early 1980s is being joined by its social and therefore sexual counterpart I saw the politics of AIDS become increasingly polarized as I toured its kingdom Essentially the battle was between those who saw the disease as a medical problem and those who used it as a moral opportunity Within the Reagan Administration Surgeon General C Everett Koop was virtually alone in hoping to treat AIDS as a medical issue A conservative who strongly opposes abortion Dr Koop has emerged as a champion of instruction for schoolchildren in the prevention of AIDS which inevitably involves sex education Rejecting Dr Koops plea President Reagan has urged schoolchildren to abstain from sex as the best method of avoiding AIDS After all he asked when it comes to preventing AIDS dont medicine and morality teach the same lesson Well no Medicine does not teach abstinence any more than philosophy teaches happiness The medical profession looks for ways a disease may spread can be prevented and finally cured it hardly advises mankind not to engage in reproductive activity As for morality of course it all depends on whose morals are being promoted George Bernard Shaws would be considerably different from Billy Grahams and it is not entirely clear that even President Reagans friends would all choose the latter The Presidents Domestic Policy Council has urged educators to place sexuality within the context of marriage and pretty much let it go at that In addition to being a message that could have been promulgated by the McKinley Administration it totally ignores the presence  almost the omnipresence  of sex among adolescents The message also implies that sex itself is the cause of AIDS and that AIDS may therefore be considered a proper punishment for those who enjoy sex in an unsanctioned context But sex is no more the cause of AIDS than swimming was the cause of polio Indiscriminate sex with partners whose behavior is risky constitutes risky behavior just as swimming in crowded public pools exposed one to the polio virus We were never lectured that swimming needed to be considered in the context of joining an exclusive pool club we were told only that the polio virus could swim around like us in pools It is not that I have no stronger moral feelings about sexuality than about swimming because I do Sex can be an unstoppable force a force that can destroy relationships if ungoverned as well as confirm love and create life But none of that has anything to do with the prevention of AIDS To confuse the prevention of AIDS with the promotion of a specific morality is to defeat both resoundingly TO RAISE YOUNG PEOPLES awareness of the AIDS problem to stop them from winging it many schools have begun special programs for their students programs that vary widely depending on the school At the elite Dalton School in Manhattan for example a frequent question from students is Can you catch AIDS from French kissing The standard answer is It hasnt been proved but why take the chance French kissing is not what they are worried about in the New York City public schools an obviously crucial battleground of the AIDS kingdom What they are worried about in addition to AIDS is needles in veins and babies in teenagers A poster at the back of Maggi Zadeks classroom at John Bowne High School in Queens shows two crossed arms with sleeves rolled up ready to receive an injection of heroin Underneath it reads AIDS IS DEADLY  Dont Pass the Spike In her elective course on adolescent sexuality the peppy Ms Zadek a 42yearold divorced woman who could qualify as any teams head cheerleader in the big game against AIDS drilled her 11th and 12thgrade students on the disease and how to fight it She bounced from her desk to the blackboard wheeling to face her charges marching to their desks to insure wakefulness joking always in motion to engage the 27 young minds that had been entrusted to her Since Ms Zadeks principal subject was after all sex there was a live possibility that she might succeed All right why are we suddenly so conscious of AIDS  Sabrina Because its in the straight community now Right Why is AIDS so scary Shawn Its fatal I see Does AIDS kill  Curtis No It breaks down the cells in your immune system to let other diseases kill you Thats it You die of opportunistic diseases Now if we are going to have intercourse what should we do to stop AIDS  Jenny Use condoms Why not the pill Ill tell you  because condoms can stop AIDS passing through them If Im the man with AIDS its in my semen and I could pass it to you Now weve mentioned rough sex Ms Zadek went on during which capillaries can be broken allowing blood and semen to mix Were not talking about an annoying herpes rash Were talking death here Jason We live in our glands not our brains But we can at least use our brains to save our glands Jason you dont want to risk your whole life on a girl at 16 Seventeen All right Hey Jason be in control of your life The problem for Jason for Maggi Zadek and for the rest of us is that AIDS is a problem with no solution Education will always help but it will only help  not save us With our multiplicity of orientations we will continue to take the same warnings information and confusions and act differently in response to them We are faced with a disease for which there is no preventive vaccine no cure and no sure end but death Can it be so surprising if our responses to this disease range from paranoia to denial In this respect the threat of AIDS is not unlike that of nuclear annihilation In both cases the will to act either personally or collectively must be preceded by a perceived and immediate danger With AIDS that perception is rising among us A generation ago a President speaking of the cold war warned Americans they were in for a long twilight struggle He might as well have been predicting AIDS THE ART WORLD GOES ALLOUT AGAINST AIDS ITS A WORLDCLASS TRAGEDY AND emergency says the painter Jim Dine explaining why he has joined more than 600 visual artists in Art Against AIDS I have children and Im about to have a grandchild thats why This week artworks ranging in price from 500 to 16 million for a canvas from the estate of Jackson Pollock will go on display and sale in some 70 New York City galleries to benefit the American Foundation for AIDS Research AmFAR which finances biomedical and educational projects Founded in 1985 by Dr Mathilde Krim of Manhattan and Rock Hudsons physician Dr Michael S Gottlieb of Los Angeles AmFAR boasts Elizabeth Taylor as its national chairman Art Against AIDS promises to be a citywide social event as well as a philanthropic one involving not only the art world but big money high society and Hollywood After a reception at Sothebys celebrities including the art dealer Leo Castelli and the actor Richard Gere will host dinners for contributors The finale will be a shindig at the nightclub the Tunnel We havent seen this kind of response to anything since the Vietnam war says Anne Livet whose cultural consulting firm Livet Reichard Company Inc is helping to organize the affair Her partner Stephen Reichard attributes the outpouring of concern to the art worlds uniquely personal basis Its not like dance or fashion which depend on groups Reichard says An artists career can be totally oneonone You can have a CEO breaking bread with an artist living in 450 square feet in the East Village At least 50 percent of the first 200000 of every sale goes to AmFAR The other half is split between the artist and the dealer according to their customary arrangement profits above 200000 are divided according to individual agreements Many participants are donating all the proceeds Castelli and his artists for instance have already raised 300000 for AmFAR which hopes to realize between 2 million and 3 million We have friends says Castelli who have died

The Iowa Caucuses Have No Clothes,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/opinion/the-iowa-caucuses-have-no-clothes.html,Get thee to Iowa political soothsayers advised Democratic candidates in the aftermath of the funny thing that happened to Gary Hart on his way to the White House I have a better suggestion Stay away If enough Presidential candidates boycotted the Feb 8 precinct caucuses the event no longer would be invested with significance  significance it does not deserve Iowans are sensible literate people The system their politicians cooked up to give them a piece of the Presidentialnominating action is unworthy of them It is dumb  so dumb that most Iowans do not participate The 1984 Democratic precinct caucuses attracted eight candidates The contenders crisscrossed the state for months wearing out themselves their workers and apparently their audience The Iowa and national press covered the contest breathlessly And on caucus night only 75000 just 14 percent  of the states 534000 registered Democrats went to the precinct meeting places The caucuses disfranchise Iowans who are out of town or who work nights or are handicapped or too frail to brave a nasty winter night A caucus is a neighborhood gathering The 2500 Democratic caucuses feature an arcane delegateelection procedure that requires wheeling and dealing sometimes for hours All in public If you do not relish political wrangling with neighbors or you cherish the secret ballot the caucuses are not for you  as they are not for most Iowa Democrats Republican caucuses are more sedate though no better attended The big event is a straw vote on the candidates That tally makes the next days headlines The most significant event though is the election of delegates to GOP county conventions Those elections shape Iowas delegation to the national convention The press hardly pays attention to caucus selection of these delegates because Republicans have not figured out a way to make it newsworthy by providing hard numbers Political activists dominate both party caucuses The fuss over the caucuses is about the choices by small numbers of elites charged up over causes ranging from the arms race to abortion to evangelical Christianity in a state that in any case is atypical demographically and economically Campaigning for the caucuses is akin to finding needles in a haystack The candidates who find the most needles  that is the likely caucusgoers  get anointed as frontrunners and top challengers Obscured by the hoopla is the insignificant fraction of voters who decide the outcomes Mr Hart was judged by the press to be Walter F Mondales chief rival in 1984 after luring a mere 9000 or so followers to the caucuses So candidates roam rural Iowa looking for straw votes by offering photo opportunities with pigs A former governor pedals across the state The search for scarce caucus participants puts the candidates on a merrygoround of picnics coffees and livingroom teteatetes An estimated 2000 members of the national press corps will report the doings much to the delight of the states tourism and economicdevelopment promoters Toss in expenditures for campaign offices staff ads meals auto rentals and hotels and Iowa has a thriving election industry Given the intrinsic worth of the caucuses they are a classic case of the proverbial rube taking city slickers to the cleaners Yes Iowas caucuses give underfinanced unknowns a shot at the Presidency The relatively low cost of a campaign is more than offset though by the toll in stamina and time taken by the ordeal The Iowa parties may be among the chief victims when their best workers become too pooped to politick in the general election after 18 months of battling each other The youngster who blurted the truth Look ma the Emperor has no clothes brought people to their senses Politicians who proclaimed the idiocy of the Iowa caucuses refused to participate and demanded reform of the hodgepodge of offshoots would perform a similar service The purpose of a nominating process is to demonstrate fitness for office Opting out of the madness by tossing a towel into the ring instead of a hat would do exactly that
THIRD WORLD NATIONS FINALLY EMBRACING POPULATION CONTROL; TRADING IDEAS: PROGRAM PROMOTES SELF-SUFFICIENCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/weekinreview/third-world-nations-finally-embracing-population-control-trading-ideas-program.html,FOR decades many thirdworld countries have been suspicious of Western offers to help curb their exploding populations Familyplanning programs sponsored by government agencies and private foundations have often been seen less as altruistic enterprises than as attempts by the industrial nations to preserve their economic dominance by controlling the growth of emerging black countries Other critics have objected that family planning is an ineffective antidote to their economic ills Only in the 1980s have most developing countries made family planning a priority and welcomed outside help Still skepticism lingers A new program from the Rockefeller Foundation is intended to help allay remaining suspicions by getting the third worlds own experts to take greater leadership in research on birth control Family planners regard new initiatives as imperative Although fertility rates are decreasing in much of the world the number of women entering the childbearing years is rising so rapidly that births will increase each year until the end of the century The United Nations estimates that by 2010 the world population will be more than 69 billion compared with almost 5 billion today This year the Rockefeller Foundation is increasing its financial support for familyplanning programs from 8 million to 135 million And while the new program is beginning modestly  with a 1 million appropriation this year  there are prospects that other wealthy foundations will become partners in the project As a first step in its new program the Rockefeller Foundation earlier this year invited a dozen specialists from Africa Asia and Latin America to the United States Most were obstetriciangynecologists or endocrinologists For two days the specialists exchanged ideas and experiences For many it was the first opportunity to learn about the latest progress in contraceptive research taking place not in one of the prominent American or European laboratories but in other thirdworld countries In several cases agreements to collaborate were made on the spot For example Dr Elsimar Coutinho a Brazilian professor of obstetrics and gynecology agreed to work with Kenya on a program to test the acceptance of a contraceptive pill that is administered vaginally bypassing the digestive system and possibly minimizing some of the adverse affects of oral contraceptives In another instance several participants from African countries showed an interest in Gossypol a male contraceptive being developed by China from cotton seed oil China in turn will experiment with an antifertility vaccine developed in India that is intended to prevent pregnancy for prolonged periods And Kenyan experts will be working with family planners in Zimbabwe and Zambia who are trying to prevent repeat abortions by encouraging effective contraception Africans find this kind of thirdworld cooperation particularly attractive said Dr Japheth KG Mati professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Nairobi and a member of the medical staff of Kenyatta National Hospital In his country where women bear an average of eight children only 17 percent of married women 15 to 44 use contraception In 15 other subSaharan countries the figure is only 1 percent In Kenya the mortality rate for children under 5 is also among the highest Consequently familyplanning activities are closely tied to programs to improve health services for women and children and encourage smaller families As the Rockefeller Foundation continues with its program it will provide for training courses that draw their faculty from thirdworld countries With financial help from the foundation exchange visits and regional workshops will be encouraged Opportunities for such contacts have been limited except for meetings and occasional conferences sponsored by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities The Rockefellers focus on mutual thirdworld aid builds on its early efforts to train specialists in developing nations said Sheldon J Segal the foundations director of population studies who organized the conference Looking around at the group members I was struck by the fact so many of them began their careers in Western laboratories he said Several were my collaborators or like Dr Coutinho of Brazil were trained at Rockefeller University But now they are in a position to train others who have not had their experiences Its the way of the future
ANTI-'PERSONHOOD' PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/01/us/anti-personhood-parley.html,Advocates of abortion rights met here this weekend to marshal arguments against abortion opponents who contend that a fetus ought to have the rights of a person Ed Doerr executive director of Americans for Religious Liberty which sponsored the conference said the group hoped primarily to influence the courts and state legislatures Conference participants included theologians medical experts social scientists and lawyers Among them was Michael J Flower a developmental biologist at Lewis and Clark College in Portland Ore who said recent findings from the study of nervoussystem growth suggested that a fetus could not be considered a person if brain function was the criterion Brain waves are not organized before the eighth month Dr Flower said On balance when is it reasonable to say that personhood begins Not until well into the third trimester Judith C Rosen a San Diego lawyer said states that had already enacted fetalpersonhood laws which give rights to the unborn had created the potential for a legal conflict between mother and fetus There are two entities in one biological unit Ms Rosen said and we have to come up with a better nonadversarial model for that relationship

ABORTIONS ABROAD ARE NEW FOCUS OF WIDENING BATTLE OVER REAGAN'S POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/01/us/abortions-abroad-are-new-focus-of-widening-battle-over-reagan-s-policy.html,The Reagan Administration is facing a series of challenges to its international population control policy which has emphasized ending all ties to family planning organizations that do not explicitly reject abortion The policy which involves millions of dollars in grants to international family planning groups is being contested in a Federal court in New York on Capitol Hill and in newspaper advertisements and billboards More important than the money is that Americas overseas population programs have become an important battlefield between the opposing sides in the nations abortion debate In early skirmishing in Congress the Administration has lost key fights involving two main elements of its policy Last month the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to end the restriction on Americas donations to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Conservatives in Congress and the Administration had stopped Government contributions to the fund because of charges that China was forcing women to have abortions as part of its population control program The Senate committee also approved overturning the foundation of the Reagan approach to international population control Under this policy announced at a family planning conference in Mexico City in 1984 and dubbed the Mexico City Policy United States funds may not be given to any international family group that includes abortion among approved methods of population control or that is even associated with groups that do It had been against the law to provide American funds directly for abortions since 1973 but after the Mexico City conference funds could not go to organizations even if their overseas abortion programs were financed by other private means Domestic Effort Was Beaten To date antiabortion campaigners have been far more successful at incorporating their ideas in programs intended for overseas than for the United States Under the Administrations policy a group receiving American funds must dissociate itself from any project in which women are advised that abortion is an option An attempt to enact a similar provision for grants to family planning agencies within the United States was easily defeated by Congress in 1985 The first major effect of the policy was that Washington ended its support for the International Planned Parenthood Federation a Londonbased organization that had been receiving about 15 million annually and thatrefused to accept the restrictions But a far more bitter battle is shaping up over the Administrations intentions to end financing for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America whose 60 million fiveyear grant for overseas programs runs out at the end of the year Planned Parenthood has filed a Federal suit against the Agency for International Development which manages international family planning programs for the Administration The suit charges among other things that the agency is violating freespeech rights Reasonable and Proper In response the agency has noted in court papers that Congress considered and rejected a measure to overturn the Administration policy in 1985 Were uncompromising in our opposition to abortion said Jay F Morris the acting director of the Agency for International Development If you feel as we do that abortion is an unconscionable method of family planning then what weve done is reasonable and proper But it is the public relations campaign by Planned Parenthood that has angered Administration officials far more than the suit Billboards feature photographs of impoverished children from developing countries with captions accusing the Administration of declaring war against them Newspaper advertisements say that extremists in the White House have produced a policy under which thousands of women will die because they will be forced to resort to unsafe abortions This is well beyond civilized debate said Mr Morris Its malicious misrepresentation Man in the Middle The campaign also includes sharp criticism of M Peter McPherson the director of the Agency for International Development Mr McPherson nominated to be Deputy Treasury Secretary has become the man in the middle of the controversy over family planning reviled by people on both sides of the abortion debate While groups like Planned Parenthood believed Mr McPherson steadily carried out a rightwing agenda on family planning conservatives complained that he was an obstacle who had to be pushed He tried to satisfy the rightwingers something that was impossible said Sharon Camp an official of the Population Crisis Committee which supports a variety of birthcontrol methods including the right to abortion Conservatives found it easier to lobby the White House to force Mr McPherson to change some policies In one example the White House persuaded the agency to provide more than 1 million for programs run by Mercedes Wilson and Christine Vollmer strong abortion opponents who hold that the only proper method of birth control is having a woman monitor her cervical mucus in an effort to determine which days of her menstrual cycle she is most fertile Under pressure from the White House Mr McPherson also dropped a requirement that advocates of the WilsonVollmer program inform women of alternative birthcontrol methods

KEMP'S 1988 STRATEGY FOCUSES ON IOWA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/01/us/kemp-s-1988-strategy-focuses-on-iowa.html,Representative Jack F Kemps first stop in Iowa was at a school cafeteria where over baked beans and ham sandwiches he told a hundred or so Hamilton County Republicans how Vietnamese refugees dreamed of settling in their state Next came the Webster City High School graduation The New York Congressman thanked Mindy for the opening prayer and Peggy for the introduction and he called for a big round of applause for Bob the schools custodian who Mr Kemp noted will be retiring this year Then there was the speech on agriculture at the Chamber of Commerce in Ames the questionandanswer session in the rural town of Algona and an appearance at the statewide Special Olympics back in Ames After three days on the road with Mr Kemp culminating in his appearance at the Republican Leadership Conference which concluded today in Des Moines one might get the impression that he was running not for President of the United States but for some Iowa state office Americas Wine Taster Thats basically our approach said Mr Kemps spokesman John Buckley To a large extent were campaigning here as if this were a race for Governor The reason has much to do with Iowas role as what Mr Kemp calls Americas wine taster Iowas party caucuses next February will be the first crucial contest of the 1988 campaign A strong showing here political analysts predict will mean national attention and momentum for the primaries that follow By the same token a poor result can quickly transform a contender into a spectator So between now and February Mr Kemp and his organization are devoting a lot more time and attention to Iowa than to most of the rest of the country The other Republican Presidential hopefuls also want to win here of course But the two who are doing the best in the opinion polls running well ahead of Mr Kemp are approaching the campaign differently The Native Son Approach Vice President Bush is relying largely on the stature of his office His supporters repeatedly remind audiences that for most of this decade Mr Bush has been only a heartbeat away from the Presidency And Senator Bob Dole whose home state and base of support lies just across the border in Kansas is presenting himself as practically a native son who ascended to national prominence as the Senate Republican leader Wouldnt it be nice to have somebody in the White House you can sit down and talk to about agriculture he asked voters in Ames on Saturday To the many analysts who say Mr Kemp cannot possibly beat that kind of opposition his strategists reply that he does not need to They believe that if they can keep expectations fairly low all Mr Kemp will have to do is run a reasonably strong third in the caucuses for everyone to say that he did better than expected A LongShot Strategy Then his strategists hope in subsequent primaries either Mr Bush or Mr Dole will falter leaving Mr Kemp as the comefrombehind longshot challenger whom the public and the press have to keep their eyes on Under current campaign rules Mr Kemp can devote a maximum of about threequarters of a million dollars to his Iowa campaign and he plans to spend every penny of that How much of a strain that will place on his efforts in other states depends largely on whether he can improve his fundraising political analysts say June may be a critical month He is scheduled to be on the road one out of every two days seeking contributions around the country Mr Kemp expects that no more than 150000 voters will turn out to support a Republican candidate in the Iowa caucuses He believes his image and message will appeal to the large evangelical Christian community abortion opponents senior citizens and young conservatives who look upon Mr Bush as too dull and Mr Dole as too somber Appeal to Typical Republican Demographic studies describe the typical Iowa Republican as a 55yearold churchgoing white Protestant from a small town a member of the Elks Rotary or other service organization who while not a farmer works in a business related to the farming economy such as agricultural supply retailing or banking Some of the themes Mr Kemp has been stressing since he announced his candidacy almost two months ago would appear to appeal to such a voter The Representative advocates getting tough with the Russians cutting taxes and outlawing abortions But some of his other positions might seem not so much a natural fit with the typical Iowa Republicans as purposefully crafted for them For example Mr Kemps commitment to cut Government spending has not led him to propose any reduction in Social Security benefits And despite his opposition to Government interference in the free market he pledged in his agricultural speech in Ames on Friday not to tamper with Federal farm subsidies and price supports any time soon No Quick Decisions Random conversations with Iowans who turned out to see Mr Kemp these past few days suggest that most are intrigued but by no means galvanized We Iowans like to keep our options open said Karl Kiilsholm a farmer from just outside Algona We dont make decisions quickly on these things Others said they liked Mr Kemps looks  he tends to remind people of either John F Kennedy or Phil Donahue and his energy and enthusiam Mr Kemp who is 51 years old has a rhetorical style that combines the rousing spirit of a locker room pep talk  he is a former professional football player  with the inspirational cadences of an evangelists sermon In almost every speech Mr Kemp pokes at least a little fun at himself The trouble with Jack Kemp he likes to say is you ask him what time it is and he tells you how to make a clock The Congressman also knows how to use humor to deflect criticism a tactic that President Reagan used effectively in regard for example to charges that he was too old to occupy the White House Ive been called a voodoo economist a snake oil salesman and a riverboat gambler Mr Kemp told one audience And thats by the Republicans
"BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT, FALWELL RETAINS LONG-HELD GOALS FOR GOD AND COUNTRY",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/04/us/back-in-the-spotlight-falwell-retains-long-held-goals-for-god-and-country.html,After several years behind the scenes the Rev Jerry Falwell is back on center stage to play reformer of the scandalplagued PTL ministry But his longterm role is still the effort to lead and expand the religious right from his church university and political bases in this central Virginia city of 83000 Both Mr Falwell and the scholars who have watched him closely over the past decade say the 52yearold Baptist minister whose Moral Majority organization and whose very name polarized people and impeded political gain after some major successes in the early 1980s is now taking a more gradual but no less intense approach toward entering and altering the American mainstream Mr Falwells vision in essence translates itself into ideas and influence a stark contrast to the grandiose gaudy architecture that served as monument to Jim Bakker the man Mr Falwell replaced at PTL An Evangelical Statesman Its not that Jerry Falwell has tried to become the intellectual leader of the religious right as much its statesman said Prof Samuel S Hill of the University of Florida in Gainesville the author of The New ReligiousPolitical Right in America If Pat Robertson is a politician and Jim Bakker is an entertainer he continued then Jerry Falwell is a preacher What he wants to do is apply the same set of ideals to religion and to America Thats why he got involved in PTL not to try to take it over Mr Falwells chief instrument now is Liberty University here formerly known as Liberty Baptist College As chancellor of the 16yearold institution Mr Falwell has poured in more than 40 million for administration and construction and has announced plans to bring the current enrollment of 7000 to 50000 by the year 2000 The academic program was recently accredited by the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges  a measure of educational legitimacy that many evangelical Christian colleges fail to gain or never bother to seek Libertys athletic program has sent football baseball and basketball players to the professional leagues and has been profiled by Sport magazine Every fall Sunday Mr Falwell announces Libertys weekend score from his pulpit at the Thomas Road Baptist Church Out to Spread the Gospel The goal in all this Mr Falwell says is to imbue students with the intellectual theory of the religious right and then send them throughout the country to spread that gospel Already some 700 graduates of Liberty University serve as pastors of their own churches and the figure grows by about 300 a year The university also broadcasts coursework and speeches over Mr Falwells Liberty Broadcasting Network a cable television service that reaches about a million homes As far as Im concerned Mr Falwell said in an interview yesterday in Fort Mill SC the PTL headquarters  Liberty University is one of the best ways that I can impact the course of the country I foresee creating for political conservatism what Harvard has done for political liberalism The sensibility at Liberty University reflects Mr Falwells own The 4400acre campus includes a tombstoneshaped shrine to the fetuses aborted since the Supreme Court legalized the practice in 1973 and a museum of creationism a doctrine that claims scientific proof for the Biblical story of creation Staying True to Its Origins Students must subscribe to a 92page code of conduct Relatively formal dress is required for class  coats and ties for men dresses or skirts for women  and such activities as dancing and drinking are barred As the Rev Mr Falwell and others see it such strictures should not isolate Liberty University within higher education but only insure fidelity to its fundamentalist origins Jerry speaks jokingly about Harvard said Prof Jeffrey K Hadden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville author of the forthcoming book Televangelism Power and Politics But he speaks seriously about Liberty being to evangelical Christians what Brigham Young is to Mormons and Notre Dame is to Catholics Mr Falwell also cites an example closer to home at least geographically My son Jerry recently earned his law degree at the University of Virginia  he recalled and as I sat there with thousands of parents I was reminded that 200 years after Thomas Jefferson had founded the university he was still stamping his influence on the country through the university At the same time Mr Falwells increasing emphasis on Liberty University and a gradual approach to social change coincides with difficulties on the financial and political fronts A Shift in Priorities Jerrys pulled back from politics in favor of the spiritual side said Cal Thomas a former vice president of Moral Majority who is now a newspaper columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate He told me that he thought his priorities had gotten out of balance By everyones estimation including Mr Falwells own he has not repeated the partisan political success of 1980 when his Moral Majority lobbying organization was widely and perhaps excessively credited with delivering the evangelical Christian vote in previously unequaled numbers to Ronald Reagan Jimmy Carter would say in defeat that Moral Majoritys influence was quite significant Moral Majority however quickly attracted ire from the political center and the left and with other religious right groups it found it difficult to get its constituents out to vote in nonPresidential elections Supplanted by New Organization Since then Moral Majority has noticeably lowered its profile The group still exists to propound the religious rights viewpoint on abortion and other domestic issues but it has in large part been supplanted by Mr Falwells newer organization the Liberty Federation The federations bailiwick is foreign policy and it supports President Reagans line on arms reduction the Strategic Defense Initiative and constructive engagement with South Africa Mr Falwell has frequently given a figure of 65 million people for the Liberty Federations following although its newsletter Liberty Report circulates to 500000 member families according to lobbying reports filed with Congress Meanwhile the political action committee that Mr Falwell established and subsequently turned over to colleagues is in financial trouble The I Love America Committee as the PAC is officially known spent only 65000 on political races in 1986 and it owes more than 70000 to creditors including Liberty Federation Moral Majority and The Old Time Gospel Hour Mr Falwells television show In addition the Federal Elections Commission recently fined the committee 1100 for filing financial disclosure reports after the deadline three times We Achieved What We Wanted Mr Falwell acknowledges that the electoral climate for him is far different and in some ways more difficult than it was in the early 1980s But he contends that he has made lasting gains in politicizing evangelical Christians and moving the national political agenda rightward Moral Majority by necessity became the lightning rod of the conservative movement he said It was first It was extremely successful in 1980 And that brought down a firestorm from all who disagreed While our own positive ratings were very shortlived  a few years at most  we acheived what we wanted to do We created a religious and social and political conscience for these millions of religious conservatives And while many would not align themselves with Moral Majority or any group they are voting at the polls doing what wed have hoped The Presidential candidacy of the evangelist Pat Robertson political scientists say is proof of the changes Mr Falwell helped create Just three days ago one of Mr Robertsons opponents for the Republican nomination Vice President Bush assured an evangelical gathering in South Carolina that he had accepted Jesus Christ as his personal savior That sort of direct spiritual experience is the common denomiator of all evangelical denominations Personally Mr Falwell has declared his support for Mr Bush but by Federal law his taxexempt organizations cannot endorse candidates For Ministry Money Trouble The third major leg of Mr Falwells operation his ministry has suffered some of the financial problems that have plagued many televison evangelists in the glutted market of the 1980s While Mr Falwells total revenue from university ministry and political groups  rose in 1986 to an alltime high of 84 million contributions to The Old Time Gospel Hour fell to 443 million the lowest since 1981 The results include a total longterm debt of 53 million 4 million of that for the television show itself and the layoff of 225 employees in January 1986 leaving a work force of 2100 Mr Falwell recently announced two major fund drives a national effort to put The Old Time Gospel Hour in the black by the end of this month and a Lynchburgarea initiative to build a 10 million 10000seat church to replace the Thomas Road facility with its capacity of 3000 worshipers Coming at this time the PTL scandal has been a mixed blessing for Mr Falwell As he indicated in an address carried on the PTL Club television show earlier this week the campaign to restore fiscal and moral rectitude to that ministry has left Mr Falwell little time for his own crises A Contrast to the Bakkers On the other hand scholars of the evangelical movement say the financial and sexual excesses of Jim Bakker have served as a contrast to Mr Falwells manner While Jim Bakker surrounded himself with such structures as an imitation Main Street and a hotel suggesting a Las Vegas version of turnofthecentury America Mr Falwells holdings here are variations of a utilitarian redbrick theme Mr Falwells personal style also appears to profit from the comparison a comparison made almost inevitable for the transfer of power at PTL The Baptist minister has an annual income of about 200000 from his church and university salaries payment for speaking engagements and royalties on a number of books He lives in a mansion but it is in a workingclass district of Lynchburg where 25000 bungalows are the rule And the image Mr Falwell projects on his oneman television show The Pastors Study is practically Ivy League with its tasteful subdued set and Mr Falwells own flannel or pinstripe suits Holding Others to His Standards What the control of PTL offers Mr Falwell is access to a nationwide cable television network reaching 135 million homes and the earning potential of the Heritage USA theme park which last year had 61 million visitors placing it behind only Disneyland and Disney World in attendance Both the television and theme park enterprises Falwellwatchers say will in time reflect the ministers rather reserved manner and his personal desire for importance instead of income Its always a good idea to take people at their own word Professor Hill of Florida said and Jerry Falwell describes himself as a Calvinist fundamentalist As a fundamentalist he continued he is open to judging other people to judging sin and error wherever its found And as a Calvinist he believes in obedience duty and standards He pretty much lives up to his own standards and he is willing to hold up other people to them too whether its liberals mainline churches or Jim Bakker

2 GROUPS LIST CANDIDATES' VIEWS ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/04/us/2-groups-list-candidates-views-on-abortion.html,It would take a small miracle for Republican Presidential aspirants to change their antiabortion views by 1988 but Democrats are virtually certain to nominate a candidate who favors a choice on the issue according to two groups favoring abortion rights Leaders of the groups the National Abortion Rights Action League and Voters for Choice said in releasing a guidebook on the candidates views that there were three Democratic contenders who fully supported abortion rights But they said the Republican contenders hewed almost without exception to the antiabortion views of President Reagan The Republican field currently reflects Ronald Reagans approach to this issue not the Republican voting population said Kristina Kiehl head of Voters for Choice But it would take a small miracle to get that changed between now and 1988 Haig Opposes an Amendment The guide was released at a news conference last week by Ms Kiehl and Kate Michelman executive director of the abortion rights action league The guidebook is based on Congressional votes gubernatorial actions statements and writings by the candidates The groups said former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr was the only Republican contender who opposed a constitutional amendment to ban abortion or to let states ban it Most potential Democratic nominees oppose any type of constitutional amendment although some have mixed records according to the guide For example it said Senator Joseph R Biden Jr had an erratic record on reproductive rights adding He has consistently opposed Federal funding of abortions for poor women and has a mixed voting and rhetorical record on the issue of whether women should have the right to choose an abortion Other potential Democratic candidates are on record against a constitutional amendment except Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia who has said he will weigh a Presidential bid this summer Mr Nunn supports a constitutional amendment permitting a state option to make abortion illegal Praise for Three Democrats Ms Michelman said Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and the Rev Jesse Jackson completely understand and support the basic right of women to full reproductive rights Another prominent Democrat Governor Cuomo of New York also fits in that category but he says he is not seeking his partys Presidential nomination One Democratic candidate former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona opposes constitutional amendment that would give states the option to make abortion illegal the guide said but opposes Federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape incest or life endangerment The guide said another Democratic contender Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee also opposed a constitutional amendment and opposed Federal financing of abortions except when life was endangered Ms Michelman said the abortion rights action league was encouraged that Democrats who had changed their thinking in recent years on abortion have shifted in support of the right to choose Simon and Gephardt Shift For example according to the guide Mr Simon opposed Federal funds for abortions for poor women in 1977 but by 1983 he was a strong supporter The guide also said Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri supported a constitutional amendment to ban abortion until last year when he said the facts had changed and there was no public consensus on taking such a step Among Republicans however the guide said the record was different For example before George Bush became Vice President he opposed a constitutional amendment banning abortion and supported Medicaid spending on abortions in cases of life endangerment rape or incest But by 1984 according to the guide he was opposing all Federal financing of abortions supporting an amendment on abortions and saying he had never advocated any other position The guide said another Republican contender Gov Pierre S du Pont 4th of Delaware supported a constitutional amendment giving states the option to make abortion illegal Four other Republican contenders support a similar constitutional amendment and also oppose Federal financing of abortions according to the guide They are Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate minority leader Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada and the Rev Pat Robertson
U.S. COURT UPHOLDS FINES AGAINST BISHOPS' GROUPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/05/nyregion/us-court-upholds-fines-against-bishops-groups.html,A divided Federal appeals court yesterday affirmed a lowercourt decision that imposed a 100000aday fine against the two principal organizations of Roman Catholic Church bishops in this country The dispute involves a contemptofcourt decision that fined the organizations for refusing to provide documents subpoenaed in a lawsuit which was filed by abortionrights groups challenging the churchs taxexempt status The fine has been stayed throughout the appeal In the contempt decision issued in May 1986 in Federal District Court in Manhattan Judge Robert L Carter imposed the fine on two organizations the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference The unusual case involves an effort to require the Internal Revenue Service to rescind the churchs taxexempt status Yesterdays 2to1 decision was issued in Manhattan by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit The majority decision was written by Judge Jon O Newman with a brief concurring opinion by Judge Amalya L Kearse and a dissent by Judge Richard J Cardamone Appeal Being Considered A lawyer for the church groups Mark E Chopko said that they were disappointed with the decision and that they had three weeks to decide whether to appeal further Marshall Beil a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case expressed delight with the latest ruling He added We hope that the Catholic bishops will comply with the rule of law and produce their documents
SCHROEDER CONSIDERS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/us/schroeder-considers-running-for-president.html,Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado said today she was considering becoming a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination Mrs Schroeder who is 46 years old and is the senior woman member of the House of Representatives had been a supporter of Gary Hart the Coloradan who withdrew from the race last month after his relationship with a Miami woman was disclosed In recent weeks Mrs Schroeder said she has been urged by many Democrats to consider making her own bid for the nomination Aides said the eightterm Congresswoman expected to decide sometime this summer whether to join a field that already has seven Democratic contenders If she runs Mrs Schroeder would be the first woman to seek the Presidency since 1972 when Representative Shirley Chisholm Democrat of Brooklyn ran unsuccessfully People have asked me to look at it seriously and I feel I have to look at it seriously Mrs Schroeder said today in an interview with The Associated Press Is It Too Late The only reason to run is to really go out and try to win she said You look at it How committed are people How far along is the process Is it too late Mrs Schroeder said that her ability to raise the money needed for a latestarting campaign would be crucial to her decision Thats very serious thats very sobering she said You can have the best ideas in the world and they dont get out unless you have the money to get them out Dan Buck her administrative assistant said Mrs Schroeder planned to spend this weekend in California meeting with Democratic fundraisers and strategists Although Mrs Schroeder would be starting late Mr Buck said she would have one advantage over the other Democratic contenders She graduated from high school in Iowa she got married in Iowa and she still has a lot of relatives in Iowa The Iowa caucuses in February are the first official voting of the 1988 primary campaign One Democratic strategist said She has served in the House longer than Gephardt and has paid her political dues campaigning for other Democrats all over the country She has national political stature and her credentials are as good or better as any of the other candidates A Critic of Pentagon Waste Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri who is leading the Democratic Presidential field in Iowa in statewide opinion polls was elected to the House in 1976 Mrs Schroeder was elected to Congress in 1972 an upset victor in a campaign in which she opposed the war in Vietnam and stressed environmental concerns In her first year in the House she won a seat on the Armed Services Committee over the strong objection of the committees chairman Representative F Edward Hebert a conservative Democrat from Louisiana She is a sharp critic of Pentagon waste Some political strategists say Mrs Schroeder who is a strong advocate of arms control could mobilize the antinuclear groups behind her candidacy which so far have scattered their support among a number of candidates She also serves on the Judiciary Committee and is a leading sponsor of legislation sought by womens groups as well as a strong opponent of efforts to restrict the right to abortion Mr Buck said that family issues would be central to her campaign if she ran The Congresswoman also coined a memorable phrase about President Reagan calling him the Teflon President because criticism did not seem to stick to him
ELECTION OPENS OLD WOUNDS IN TRIESTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/world/election-opens-old-wounds-in-trieste.html,Trieste is an Italian port city designed by Austrians and by Italian standards its streets are a bit too straight and its citizens a little too orderly inclined to pay their taxes punctually and to stop at pedestrian crossings when the lights are red So the parliamentary election campaign in this erstwhile Adriatic outlet of the Hapsburg empire which projects into the western flank of Yugoslavia is bland lowkey and determinedly unboisterous Local judges severely fine political parties that affix their posters anywhere but on designated billboards We dont want to disturb the peace of the city said Sergio Colini a bulky and imposing Christian Democratic Member of Parliament who added that his right hand was cramped from personally scribbling several thousand letters to his constituents Yet stately Trieste has its secret traumas its halfforgotten nightmares It is at election time that they rise uncomfortably close to the surface 1945 Massacre Remembered In the spring of 1945 during the collapse of Hitlers Reich Titos Communist Partisans occupied Trieste for 40 days and massacred thousands of Italians imagined or actual Nazi collaborators Men women and children were thrown alive into an abyss in the rocky Carso Mountains which pitch up dramatically from the flat grayblue Adriatic It was not until 1954 that the city ceased to be a United Nations charge and returned to Italian control but in the meantime 350000 Italian refugees had fled from the nearby Istrian Peninsula which was absorbed by Yugoslavia When Italy and Yugoslavia finally resolved their frontier differences through the Treaty of Osimo in 1975 there was a backlash here against what was seen as highhandedness in Rome A populist coalition calling itself the List for Trieste denounced the treaty and protested against the projected establishment in the Carso of an ItalianYugoslav industrial zone that was expected to draw 30000 Yugoslav workers Environmental concerns were cited but antiYugoslav sentiment and fear of cheap foreign labor fueled the protest In a series of elections the autonomyminded List for Trieste emerged as the biggest political force in the city whose fastshrinking population stands today at 240000 But most politicians say the List is in slow decline  perhaps a good omen for the 5 percent of Triestes residents who are Slovenes as well as Italian citizens The Lists most conspicuous figure is Mayor Giulio Staffieri a compactlooking former airline pilot who mostly worries about promoting Trieste as a port for exports from Austria Hungary and southern Germany and trying to secure it the status of a dutyfree zone A new stretch of superhighway connecting the city to Vienna and Munich should help revive the moribund port Yet when Mr Staffieri a dapper man talked about Yugoslavia he suddenly sounded less modern voicing the opinion that all Slav peoples have this expansionist imperialist instinct He added quickly that Yugoslavias ruinous economic plight does not give it time to worry about us and that is better for us too Up to God to Pardon We preserve the memory the Mayor said of the massacres and refugee exodus four decades ago We can pretend to forget in order to live peacefully here But it is up to God to pardon In an ornate deal characteristic of Italian politics the List for Trieste is not running its own candidates in the June 14 elections but instead has persuaded both the Socialist and Liberal Parties to put its people on their ballots It is an opportunistic arrangement for Bettino Craxis Socialists since several List candidates are conservatives on such issues as divorce and abortion and sometimes sound like smoldering irredentists on lost Istria But at a rainsprinkled rally in the vast Piazza della Unita dItalia Mr Craxi defended the alliance as strengthening Triestes links with the rest of Italy Politicians concur that the most pressing problem facing Trieste is how to arrest the citys gentle but undeniable economic decline There seems little hope of reversing its tumbling population curve  annually 4500 Triestinos die and only 1500 are born It is an old city and a young city said Antonio Cuffaro a Communist Member of Parliament comparing Triestes aging population with its 18thcentury Hapsburg beginnings very young by Italian standards And it has the disadvantage of knowing its own history
WHY YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR IS A GROUP,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/magazine/why-your-family-doctor-is-a-group.html,A YEAR AND A HALF ago nearing the end of a twoyear fellowship at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center Tom Lester had never heard of Katonah NY or the Katonah Medical Group And except for having decided that he wanted no more of institutional medicine he had given little thought to where he might practice  until he picked up The New England Journal of Medicine and saw the groups ad for someone interested in combining general internal medicine with his matched subspecialties of hematology and oncology In January 1986 Lester took the 40mile train ride from New York City to Katonah to meet with the groups seven internists He was met at the station by Dr James W Hanway the groups 58yearold president and the two men drove the mile or so back to the office through the quiet town of two and threestory storefronts They went past the Bakers Cafe the thrift shop and a local institution called Charles where a person in one stop can still pick up a decent pair of slacks and an extension for a garden hose It was a persuasive introduction to the community for Lester and like the good schools phrase in the ad which Lester in his childless innocence took to mean that the groups members had all attended same was intended to signal that in Katonah a doctor would find life especially pleasant As soon as I saw the town Lester recalls I thought this is what I want But it was his reading of the group itself and particularly of its members tolerance for individual differences in style of practice that convinced Lester he had found the right place Meeting with the group for the second time with 12 of the 13 members present Lester found himself professionally pincered between Herbert Kaufmann the groups erudite and laconic gastroenterologist who wanted to know how aggressive the young man would be in the treatment of a terminal pancreatic cancer in an elderly woman and Stephen J Grayer the groups general surgeon who wanted to make sure Lester would be aggressive enough in treating a young woman with breast cancer There was one test still to come At the time of the interview Lester was 31 single and living in a studio apartment in hospital housing in Manhattan He was furthermore engaged to a woman who he made clear to the group had no intention of giving up her Memorial SloanKettering job as an instructor of nurses in the administration of chemotherapy Though not given to communal barbecues or other rituals of togetherness the group whose members lead extremely comfortable but farfromostentatious suburban existences suggested that Lester bring his fiancee out to Katonah for dinner to meet them and their rarely assembled wives I think Lester says of the polite 11thhour inspection that ensued they wanted to be sure I would be happy here In the end the Katonah group enthusiastically invited Thomas J Lester to become its 14th member It was a match that seemed likely to last and to the Katonah group as well as within the larger medical community continuity is no small thing these days IN A PROFESSION IN WHICH permanence and the expectation of it once seemed as much a part of the natural order as the deference that accompanies the medical honorific change has begun to work its way It is manifest in an onslaught of such threatening terms as cost controls and health maintenance organizations in escalating rates of malpractice insurance and in the even higher mental cost of having to factor into every medical decision not just what is best for the patient but what is prudent for ones own professional survival It has to do with a seemingly unchecked drive toward specialization and with the widening gap between patient expectations and the stilllimited solutions medicine has to offer Finally it has to do with the subtle diminishment of the personal autonomy of individual doctors and of what one member of the Katonah group Harold Federman a pharmacists son from the Bronx speaks of as the vocation of medicine We grew up in an atmosphere where we felt we were doing good says Steve Grayer a cum laude graduate of Harvard Medical School We felt respected and we tried our best We feel we havent changed But suddenly to be challenged at every turn in the road Its almost like you have to prove youre not guilty Once the individual doctors best defense against outside interference was his standing as a solo practitioner In todays rapidly changing medical universe the closest thing to a protected environment  and the best guarantor of medical autonomy for the individual doctor  may be the group In 1961 when the Katonah group began only a tiny fraction of the nations physicians were in group practices of three or more doctors By 1969  three years after the creation of the Federal Governments Medicaid and Medicare programs and the first year for which the American Medical Association keeps such figures  there were 6371 groups by 1984 the last year for which the AMA provides figures that number had more than doubled to 15485 More significantly between 1980 and 1985 the number of doctors in group practices increased 43 percent compared to only an 18 percent increase in the number of physicians in solo practice To many people the very idea of group medicine suggests a further diminishment of intimacy between the patient and the physician But the entity called the group practice is in fact simply a legal and economic entity that harbors the stillindependent successors to the family doctor of myth and memory box left The majority of groups today remain singlespecialty alliances of fewer than five physicians although the number of multispecialty practices like the Katonah group is fast increasing as well For several decades the group practice has made sense for doctors loath to be their own bookkeepers or eager for respite from the 24hour demands of the job In recent years as the technological sophistication of medicine has grown the groups ability to absorb the cost of services that would sink a solo practitioner also has increased its medical utility But perhaps the greatest and most unexpected impetus to the formation of group practices today is the determination of doctors to retain some degree of control over their own professional lives In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine a team of researchers from the University of Minnesota School of Public Health outlined the struggle going on between doctors and an assortment of thirdparty payers and medical entrepreneurs The researchers affirmed that group practices provide one of the best means for physicians to regain an influential position in the patientcare process Since 1968 the Katonah group whose members have admitting privileges at Northern Westchester Hospital a highly regarded 300bed facility in nearby Mount Kisco  has practiced out of a comfortable twostory tan brick building just south of the center of town owned by a real estate partnership that parallels the medical corporation Medical and clerical backup for the physicians is provided by 43 employees overseen by the groups business administrator of 16 years Richard C Amodeo whose other chief duty is to track the fluttery paper trail of patient records test orders and billing slips that link each patient to his medical treatment and ultimate financial accounting It is if not a flawless operation one that frees its principals from most of the lesser irritations of their profession It gives its members continued medical autonomy each answering only to his own idea of what is right and allowing one another as Jim Hanway puts it to practice as we all would practice It is precisely that ethic  once a given in medicine but increasingly the privilege of the few  that drew Tom Lester to Katonah where he is now in the middle of an 18month trial period the group calls a fellowship He and the older members of the Katonah group  all of them men though next January they will be joined by their first female colleague an internist  stand halfway between the old and the new medicine A PROPER CHECKUP BY Henry Horst Ludemann is a thing of beauty and the fact that it is often not completed in less than two hours is simply one more proof to the 61yearold Ludemanns devoted patients that the regard they feel for him is reciprocal In 33 years of practice the courtly Germanborn Ludemann  who was brought to the Katonah area as an infant and who is considered by patients to be truly a local man one of their own  has refined his examiners art into a symphony of tests mechanical tactile and gently inquisitorial Im criticized by my associates for taking so much time says Ludemann whose days routinely stretch to 10 PM or later before he heads for his home in nearby Somers in his lumbering ancient Cadillac But I cant do it any other way I hate to think that because I didnt do something a patient will suffer Indeed any patient who cherishes the childhood memory of the family doctor standing beside the sickbed will believe he has found heaven in Henry Ludemanns patient capable hands The shortfused and those in a hurry had better choose another member of the group As a rough rule of thumb Dr Ludemann sees two patients for every three seen by Jim Hanway or Harold Federman and he sees them for close to twice as long His dictated patient notes swell with a Jamesian detail and although the group employs two fulltime transcriptionists the volume of Ludemanns assessments requires that most of his tapes be sent out for typing Ludemann is an anachronism but a worthy one one of his associates remarked You almost have to be retired to go to him How he might fare in a health maintenance organization in which doctors  either as employees or on contract  offer prepaid medical care is questionable Of all the threats to a physicians autonomy perhaps none looms so large as the HMO  a potential sweatshop in the view of some the dragon outside the gates to many others And indeed whatever one thinks of HMOs there can be little doubt that many doctors including several in the Katonah group could not survive in one The purpose of an HMO is to achieve cost savings says Geraldine Alpert a consultant who has advised the Katonah group That means seeing as many patients as possible and keeping productivity high In fact the group has lately found itself besieged by job applicants reporting just such fiscal tyranny One woman doctor said Jim Hanway said she had to see one patient every 12 12 minutes She couldnt take it Because of the spiraling national growth of HMOs  from 39 in 1972 to 595 last year  the longterm threat to oldfashioned practitioners like Ludemann is substantial In the New York metropolitan area however where forprofit HMOs have been operating only during the last two years the pressure is not yet so intense as to force the issue And although the Katonah group has been approached by several HMOs trying to sign up doctors in the area Mrs Alpert has advised them to wait and see For now the group can afford to put off a decision on joining an HMO but it has nevertheless begun to feel the pinch of healthcare costcutting Onethird of the groups 27000 patients a year for example are over the age of 65 but Medicares fee schedule frozen for almost the last three years currently permits the group to charge Medicare patients no more than 3535 on a basic 45 office visit Of that amount Medicare actually pays only 2352 Depending on whether the group has accepted assignment on a given patient it must then bill the patient for some portion of the remainder of the fee Implicit in many of Medicares directives is the question of control  of who will decide what is medically warranted and on what basis If you were 65 says Steve Grayer whose deadpan earnestness on medical matters can give way in a flash to an enthusiastic discussion of the merits of old cars and I thought you needed to have your gall bladder out until recently I could not do it without first calling up a Federal agency and getting them to approve the admission Its easy to understand why they do it says Grayer who was the chief surgeon in a medical unit along the Ho Chi Minh Trail before joining the group in 1969 Theyre trying to save money and thats not a bad thing to do But it still is a little demeaning after youve been doing this for 20 years  and hopefully not cheating anybody to have to call up some 800 number and get permission Nor is the Federal Government the only agent looking over doctors shoulders in the effort to cut costs One day during his office hours Jim Hanway had a call from an insurancecompany nurse representing the employer of a patient he had admitted to the hospital She wanted to know how long the patient would be hospitalized I dont know Hanway replied Well the woman said Ill check back with you in a few days The intended pressure on Hanway to cut the patients stay short was unmistakable and he was appalled Despite his institutional credits Yale College Class of 1950 and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons Class of 1954 Hanways practical view is that his value as a physician hinges on the personal connections he can establish with his patients A big part of the art of medicine he says is getting people to do what you want A community group practice allows Hanway to maintain that connection in the face of the many forces that threaten it Still while many observers argue that doctors should isolate their decision making from any financial considerations Hanways personal thesis is We can break the bank And it is totally unrealistic not to think about it CERTAINLY ONE OF the principal factors in the escalation of costs is the growth of specialization It is a trend that this group and others simultaneously represent and resist The groups disposition is clearly generalist five internists three obstetrician gynecologists offering the traditional range of care for female patients two pediatricians to treat children from birth through adolescence a general surgeon who removes tumors and sews up split lips The remaining three specialists are all practicing internists who see nonspecialty patients as well In practical terms the increase in specialty medicine has been a mixed blessing for both doctors and patients While there have been real improvements in diagnosis and treatment specialization has also resulted in inflated expectations of certainty greater expense and a decided loss of intimacy between patients and their primary doctors Ideally the possibility of informal consultation and referral within a multispecialty group offsets the problems If I hear a murmur during a patients checkup says Paul R Spierling who knows that the annual gynecological checkup is often a womans only regular contact with a doctor I can call one of the internists over to see whether its normal or something to worry about If I feel a lump I can call Grayer to take a look and its no charge to the patient It was specifically the prospect of this sort of collegial backup that led Spierling to choose a multispecialty group in the first place And yet there is no getting around the fact that specialization breeds more specialization In the late 1960s while stationed at Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas Hal Federman actually apprenticed himself to a local doctor in order to learn how to do D and Cs Today says Federman I wouldnt be allowed that kind of flexibility Listening to Federman tell his story at the hospital Tom Lester  who has just performed a bonemarrow extraction on one of Federmans patients  shakes his head in amazement I dont even do pap smears he says It used to be Federman says that we all did sigmoidoscopies as part of the normal checkup using the oldfashioned instrument  a rigid scope the approximate size and shape of the lower half of a baseball bat And in theory Federman who at 47 refers to himself as an older physician could still learn how to use fiberoptics But Federman a conscientious precise man who also heads the hospital ethics committee already has a full plate So he refers patients to Kaufmann whose own practice  once perhaps 50 percent general internal medicine  is now almost 90 percent gastrointestinal work PATIENTS ARE SENT to Herb Kaufmann in the expectation that he will discover the true cause of their rectal bleeding recurrent stomach pain or change in bowel habits Much of the time he does Indeed watching him perform a colonoscopy one morning on a patient in his 60s it is hard to believe that the body can keep any secrets at all With the patient comfortably sedated Kaufmann slowly feeds the black scope into the patients sigmoid colon site of the majority of colon cancers Through the eyepiece of his scope Kaufmann inspects the colons pale pink walls carefully for polyps lesions or diverticula  small pockets that form in the colons walls  before picking up speed like a bobsled pilot banking expertly as the colon makes its predictable turns and dips Having spotted a polyp in the sigmoid at the start of the exam Kaufmann now returns to locate it exactly a tiny pink loop of tissue nearly hidden inside a fold of the colon He feeds a fine wire snare into a channel of the scope then lassoes the polyp with the combined dexterity of a microsurgeon and a puppeteer drawing it back through the scope to be sent out for histologic examination It is a mesmerizing sequence How terrific one cant help thinking How amazing And it is But there are limits to the certainty even these marvels of technology can insure Kaufmann tells the story of a patient whose symptoms of indigestion led logically to both a series of Xrays and endoscopy down into the stomach No disease was detected Six months later the patient was diagnosed as having an infiltrating cancer of the stomach wall Asked whether it troubled him Kaufmann whose undergraduate degree from Princeton was in philosophy says Yes and no No doctor wants to miss a diagnosis he says and yet a good doctor has to learn to live with uncertainty However at ease doctors might be with the concept of uncertainty it is rare for their patients to feel such equanimity when their own health is at stake More and more frequently for more and more patients only further tests or a referral will do Nor is the patients quest for certainty the only force behind the increase in specialization Nothing has so consolidated physicians reliance on specialists and technology as the increase in malpractice claims and awards No doctor remains unaware of the potential for legal disaster in the course of his most routine work We were all brought up in an era when the internist half of whose training is in cardiology  took care of the heartattack patient says Jim Hanway My first 10 years up here we didnt even have a cardiologist on staff at the hospital full time So we did everything Today because of the malpractice climate that is no longer true One of the few continuing sources of disagreement in the group is over the sporadic suggestions by several members that they invite a cardiologist to join their practice For now the consensus among the internists is that they do not want to narrow their purview and their connection to their patients any further Whats more few cardiologists would want to do general internal medicine as the group would require according to Hanway But as a protective compromise virtually every heartattack patient is referred to a specialist for at least a single consultation I can tell you before my cardiac consultant ever sees the patient what hes going to write and exactly what hes going to order says Hanway But if the patient does badly  and the mortality rate of seriously ill patients who have heart attacks is significant then some court is going to say Doctor if you had had a cardiologist take care of this heart attack the patient wouldnt have died  whether or not thats the case A short time ago Hanway learned that a patient of his a judge had presided over a malpractice case in which a 9 million judgment was made against a neurosurgeon Only a lifelong regard for the rights of patients prevented Hanway from bringing the case up with the judge on his next visit What Id like to have said to him Hanway says was If this judgment stands it will do more to change the economics of medicine than anything else that has occurred yet  Except for being named with nine other doctors in a 1962 case that came to nothing Hanway has never been sued in his nearly 30 years of practice making him something of a rarity In part its luck he says and in part its that you dont sue your friends an advantage of living and practicing in a tightly knit community But at bottom Hanway has no conviction that justice is at work in protecting him or any other doctor Half of what is labeled medical malpractice says Hanway who has served on both the Westchester County and New York State medical malpractice review boards is bad results that were not preventable or unexpected results or honest mistakes by decent doctors  and we are all human Virtually everyone in the group has been sued at least once All can recite horror stories from friends or personal experience Even Henry Ludemann everybodys choice as the most careful of doctors was sued by the widow of a man hed never met before but failed to save after the mans aorta was severed in a highspeed automobile accident TO ASK DOCTORS TO talk about the changes under way in medicine is to invite perhaps predictably a catalogue of things gone wrong and especially of outside forces raining down interference To watch them at their work is to discover something quite opposite  a joy in the daily business of medicine and especially in the contact with patients that seems to balance out the long litany of real or anticipated losses Like the work of mothers or policemen the work of a community doctor is a continual juxtaposition of the trivial and the tragic the fixable and the insoluble The daily bread of community medicine is leavened with uncelebrated victories punctuated with reminders of their limits as healers Early last year when a newly pregnant young woman named Diane Anton came to see Paul Spierling on the recommendation of a neighbor it was with the expectation of an entirely routine pregnancy On his first examination of her however Spierling discovered an ovarian cyst that he told her would bear watching If it did not disappear there was a danger that it could twist or rupture causing a sudden emergency Or it could simply continue to grow taking up room needed for the fetus But the biggest problem Spierling said is that we dont know what it is and you dont want to sit on a premalignancy or a malignancy for nine months In fact the cyst did not disappear and as the woman approached her 18th week the optimum time for any intervention she and Spierling agreed on surgery to remove it The operation was scheduled for early on a Tuesday morning at Northern Westchester where many of the groups members have served terms as chiefs of staff Mrs Anton a selfpossessed 28yearold medical microbiologist was given a spinal anesthetic to minimize the risk to the fetus progesterone to help prevent a spontaneous abortion and also heparin an anticoagulant because of the increased tendency of pregnant women to form blood clots With an associate who is not a member of the group assisting and with Mrs Antons fourmonth fetus lying undisturbed inches from where they probed in her abdomen Spierling worked to free and remove a large endometrial cyst that had completely occupied her right ovary It was not malignant but had already begun to take up extra space in her pelvis and almost certainly would have interfered with the pregnancy The operation during which Mrs Antons large eyes remained open and calm  though she said afterward she was anything but  took over two hours and like the natural process it was meant to protect had the mixed feel of the miraculous and the mundane In this case Diane Anton was home from the hospital within a week back to work in three and carried her baby to term In October she gave birth by Caesarean at Northern Westchester with Paul Spierling assisting the doctor who happened to be on duty that day to a 9pound 14ounce boy whom she and her husband named Daniel A MONTH OR SO later Tom Lester found himself taking the somewhat confused medical history of a patient sent to him for evaluation by Jim Hanway The patient was a retired trucker in his early 60s who appeared at least a decade older and whose wheezing and red face advertised the lifetime of smoking and drinking that he described to Lester Six months earlier the man had had part of his right lung removed because of a tumor and was then almost immediately diagnosed as having a second malignancy in his left lung Ordinarily a second surgery would be recommended but because of emphysema the patients lung function was already so poor that he could not walk without having difficulty breathing Removal of a portion of his left lung would reduce his lung capacity still further Lester testing his understanding asked How would you feel about having another surgery The patient compressed his lips and said If its 5050 Ill take my chances walking At this point Jim Hanway joined the discussion to hear Lesters opinion and it seemed clear to act as advocate for his patient While the patient sat silent with arms crossed and head bowed the two doctors discussed his situation in plain English He doesnt want to be made into a pulmonary cripple Hanway said with a gesture toward the man He is willing to try radiotherapy or chemotherapy if he can be assured some chance of it helping Otherwise hell take his chances with his tumor Lester listened to Hanways reiteration of the patients position looking from Hanway to the patient then back again before explaining that what it came down to then was very little choice at all Because neither chemotherapy nor radiation held any promise of eradicating the tumor the patients only chance  and it was a fair one  lay in surgery But Lester could not guarantee what the patient understandably wanted guaranteed that he would not be worse off cured than he was now When Hanway and his patient had left the room however Lester looked down at the file still on his desk and noted once again the patients level of pulmonary function At Memorial SloanKettering he said theres no question but that he would have been treated In the group the choices are made differently THE FINANCES OF THE GROUP THE KATONAH MEDICAL GROUP IS NOT just a simple collection of 14 community doctors but a privately held corporation that owns a building and land valued at 17 million and took in 4 million for tests services and procedures in 1986 All the groups members hold shares in the corporation A new member like Tom Lester initially purchases his shares for 1000 they then increase in value over the course of his tenure based on the income he brings to the group The building partnership is held equally by the members On becoming a member a doctor takes on a lowinterest 23year mortgage from the group Group members are paid salaries as executives of the corporation and automatically receive quarterly bonuses if there has been a profit Both figures are based on the individual physicians billings for tests and services seniority has no bearing A percentage of the profits are held by the corporation as retained earnings on which are based the shifting value of the shares The net income of the doctors ranges from 60000 to 160000 a year with the low men on the totem pole being the pediatricians and surgery and obstetrics generating the largest fees according to the group president Jim Hanway The average income of doctors in America is just over 100000 You can get richer quicker as a solo practitioner but youre not as safe says Richard Amodeo the groups business manager In fact there are few strictly financial advantages for the group members that do not also accrue to solo practitioners the doctors receive no special perquisites such as cars or housing But the groups size allows it to insure itself against a members illness or injury for 90 days whereupon a commercial disabilityinsurance policy kicks in Thus a malady that might seriously burden a solo practitioner such as the heart attack that Dr Henry Ludemann suffered in 1985  is dealt with easily by the group The group spends 25 million annually on supplies equipment insurance and salaries for its 43 employees all expenses coming out of a pool to which each doctor contributes a flat percentage of his income Among the largest single expenditures is 375000 in annual malpracticeinsurance premiums Only five doctors have left the Katonah group in 26 years and its first retirement required by the group at age 70  will not occur until January When a member leaves his shares in the medical corporation are paid out to him over three years his equity in the real estate partnership is paid out over a fiveyear period In addition a departing doctor also receives separation pay of 100 a month for every month hes been a member of the corporation up to a maximum of 30000 for 25 years service  MARTHA FAY
RED HIGH HEELS AND SMOKE STOCKINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/books/red-high-heels-and-smoke-stockings.html,LOVE ME TENDER By Catherine Texier 212 pp New York Penguin Books Paper 695 CATHERINE TEXIER has written a strange haunting novel that both seduces and spurns much like the characters who inhabit it Composed in a jumpcut style and recorded in a blackandwhite grainy prose the story of Lulu a 25yearold French dancer and her sexual wanderings across Manhattan is a cinematic rendering highly reminiscent of the nouvelle vague of French film making alienated moody intellectual and sexy There are five characters in Love Me Tender whom Lulu seduces or spurns or you might say by whom Lulu is misused Ms Texier encourages a certain ambiguity In matters of pure sex the mindless encounter rough trade the sadomasochistic fantasy or reality the user and used are often one and the same There is Salvine a rich expatriate Frenchwoman whom Lulu meets through an ad in the personals column She wants Lulu to speak of her French childhood into a tape recorder She wants to use Lulus memories to find her own I want to understand Salvine repeats What About changing culture what it does to your memories to your past Later she turns out to be a dominatrix by coincidence having an affair with one of Lulus lovers There is Mystique a topless dancer at the Blue Night Lounge where Lulu has a job a downtrodden woman suffering midlife crisis She listens if she is spoken to But she wont solicit information If someone suggests she lacks basic human curiosity she says life is no police crossexamination and anyway you dont get to know people by listening to them but by looking at them smelling them sniffing them Mystique is suspicious of the intellect She only trusts her senses Mystique is Lulus only friend She mothers her There is Henry the lecherous illustrator who plays fantasy sex games with Lulu and who it transpires is about to abandon her and get married He is not thinking of Lulu    who must be on her way to his place but of another woman very young whom he met that same afternoon in the subway    Theyve exchanged phone numbers    and he knows for sure theyll be lovers but not yet let her stew a day or two then he thought of Lulu later as he was taking a bath and of something hed never done with her and he sent a cab for her so that she wouldnt have an excuse for not coming And then there are Lulus two other lovers Julian the junkiepoet who shows up sporadically and whom she may love and Mario the hot macho son of a Lower East Side drug dealer with whom she travels to Mexico and who may love her Put on your red high heels your silk bra your garters and your smoke stockings Julian whispers Get dressed for me Ever met a Latin whos not jealous [ Mario ] tells her Chica dont be naive And what does a jealous Latin do Mario Dont mess with him if you want my advice Lulu is searching for herself for her identity she never knew her mother for her cultural roots she too is an expatriate for some sense of her connection to love All of which is right and expected in what is fundamentally a comingofage novel What is unexpected eloquent and shocking even Apollinairean in its implications is that Lulu conducts this search through sex She is promiscuous identified as a slut detached from tenderness fixated on lust Ms Texier whose prose is tight and vivid but like Lulu often impassionate writes some hot raw realistic sex scenes here This is an unusual risky business for a female writer of serious literature Anais Nin being perhaps the sole exception The ranks are filled with ministers daughters who felt lust but had to veil it with lyricism or torrid romance Catherine Texier combines in one woman questing intellect and guiltless passion The result is modern strangely powerful and definitely a turnon It is Lulus detachment however that becomes a problem for the book She engages with no one and that includes the reader Lulus lack of feeling and persistent alienation finally eclipse her as a being we can relate to This might have been all right were she not the protagonist But I never had a sense of Lulu at all The intelligence and originality of the writing my involvement with the other characters and the idea of Lulu carried me to the end At the climax of the book Lulu becomes pregnant and has an abortion and there is a surprising poignant plot twist that ties up the end But something odd happens next Ms Texier seems to turn moral She seems to say that Lulu in her mindless sexual coupling was doomed to lose love perhaps that she even deserved to  an oldfashioned attitude coming on the heels of such an enlightened handling of female sex Or maybe not Though she lives in New York Ms Texier was born and raised in France Her first novel Chloe lAtlantique was published there Love Me Tender is her first novel in English She was groomed in the tradition of Laclos and Lulu is a practitioner of les liaisons dangereuses Perhaps Ms Texier like Lulu is seducing and spurning us In the fires of love all get singed
"POLISH CHURCH AWAITS POPE, BEWILDERED BY ITS NEW VIGOR",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/world/polish-church-awaits-pope-bewildered-by-its-new-vigor.html,The Roman Catholic Church of Poland which was beleaguered and defensive when Karol Wojtyla was rising through its ranks has grown remarkably strong in his nine years as Pope Now as John Paul II is about to begin his third papal visit to his native land starting Monday the church from which he came faces serious paradoxical problems arising from its very success New Harder Questions When the church was weaker and its priests were being persecuted it did not have to deal with questions like these  Should the church retreat further from the social activism of the Solidarity period when it shielded believers and nonbelievers challenging the Communist state  Should it bestow even limited blessing on the policies of Polands leaders and risk being accused of collaboration  Should it urge Polish workers to work harder for less money  Should it curb its most aggressively antiCommunist priests in the hope of expanding Vatican influence beyond Polish borders to the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries For decades perhaps even centuries the Polish church saw itself as the good son who in the parable cited in Luke was less warmly appreciated by his father than his prodigal brother Like the good son the Polish church was loyal constant pious and dutiful Yet it felt itself to be less cherished in Rome than the Italian French Irish or American churches It had a tendency to parochial isolation and its martyrs were more contemporary than those of other churches With the ascension of the then Archbishop of Cracow to the throne of St Peter that selfimage changed and the Polish church grew more assertive at home and in the world A Growing Clergy The clergy is growing here There are now more Roman Catholic seminarians in Poland than in any country in the world A third of all newly ordained European priests are Poles More churches are being built in Poland than in the rest of Europe Mass is broadcast weekly on the state radio Catholicsponsored newspapers reach two million families Most children attend catechism classes We have virtually attained full freedom of worship said Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski of Warsaw The Rev Antoni Pominski editor of a church newspaper in Woclawek said If someone predicted 10 years ago that the church would have gained so much so soon I would have thought him mad Krzysztof Sliwinski a writer for liberal Catholic journals who was associated with the now outlawed Solidarity labor union said Sometimes I think there are elements in our church that are now almost indecently triumphant Just as the elevation of Karol Wojtyla to the papacy inspired the Polish nation so the rise of Solidarity and its protection by at least part of the clergy further enhanced the churchs influence For centuries the church defended national interests against real and wouldbe occupiers and their local catspaws The church also prospered after the suppression of Solidarity when it remained the last refuge and resort of opposition The church was strong before Solidarity Jozef Cardinal Glemp the Polish Primate said in an interview shortly after thousands of Solidarity activists were interned in 1981 It got stronger during Solidarity and it gained again in strength under martial law It seems that whatever happens in Poland  whatever else it does strengthens the church From Strength Come Problems But with the strength come problems Society has projected its hopes and aspirations on the church and now society expects too much from us Bishop Dabrowski said As Solidarity declined he said some of its supporters have looked increasingly to the church to take up the struggle for social justice human rights and broader liberties At the same time the Government has sought to cajole the church into giving its blessing to Gen Wojciech Jaruzelskis professed policies of normalization and economic change Many inside and outside the church say they believe that the Popes visit and planned meeting with Lech Walesa the founder of Solidarity and scheduled discussions with women workers in Lodz will communicate his respect for the ideals of Solidarity But there is a general expectation that the visit will mark a transition from a time when many priests could openly identify with the labor unions as a vehicle for national revival and independence A Nonpolitical Emphasis The Pope is to pray at the grave of the Rev Jerzy Popieluszko the proSolidarity priest murdered by the secret police But the event is listed as private Similarly parish priests are asking people not to bring political placards to observances or to make the V hand signs for Solidarity Some Poles are asking how much autonomy the church needs before it is prepared to undertake programs of social action As one liberal Catholic asked over dinner recently How many state authorizations to build churches have to be given before the church authorities can feel bold enough to start demanding the right to organize hospitals nursing schools their own high schools or independent associations of Catholic workers Though there is a marked hesitancy on the part of some in the hierarchy for institutional broadening of church involvement in social services the episcopate has in general terms endorsed a course of social activism A Variety of Strategies As explained by several church leaders the Polish church chafing under the restraints of once aggressively atheistic Communism had these possible strategies  It could as Polands leaders once hoped confine itself to purely religious life officiating at ceremonies and maintaining church buildings and cemeteries  Or it could in theory seek to support or initiate small political groupings as embryonic Christian democratic parties that would take part in the limited parliamentary politics tolerated in a country where the Communist Party by definition has the deciding role Though both these concepts have their proponents in the church they have been rejected by the Polish bishops who instead have claimed the right of the church to involve itself fully in the social and moral life of the nation In the aftermath of Solidaritys rise some priests saw the nonviolent movement as a reenactment of 19th century Polish uprisings against occupation forces which priests joined and blessed First Visit Inspired Nation There are historians and political observers who believe that it was the patriotic aspects of the Popes first visit in 1979 that generated the jubilation and euphoria that led to the rise of Solidarity When he returned for his second visit the Pope was clearly sorrowed by martial law and he pressed for release of political prisoners and a national reconciliation Now on the eve of his third visit there are no political prisoners and large parts of Polish society are worn down by the raising and dashing of hope In this atmosphere church leaders are expecting that the Pope will be stressing personal sacrifice and individual religious and moral transformation rather than a prospect of miraculous or eruptive national redemption I have a feeling that all of us Poles have failed his hopes and wishes for us said Father Pominski the editor in Woclawek He came and too many of us thought that things would change by miracle In the first two visits we all saw him as ours a Polish pope but now I think he is coming as the the worlds pope and I have a feeling he will try to reach each of us deeply in a spiritual way Some priests have predicted that the Pope will focus on alcoholism divorce and abortion Both in the church and in Polish society there is a significantly widespread view of the good Pope and the bad Primate Asked about this Bishop Dabrowski the Primates counselor smiled and said The Pope speaking with universal authority inspires with his vision while the Primate has to pull us back and restrain us from unrealistic aspirations Others said Cardinal Glemp was also concerned with strengthening church institutions in preparation for the day when a Pole would no longer be Pope

A Country Still Reaching for a Civil Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/09/opinion/l-a-country-still-reaching-for-a-civil-religion-568487.html,To the Editor Alan Brinkleys lament over the lack of a meaningful conception of American public life as a whole of a commonly accepted conception of what is good or right or just What Harts Fall Says About America OpEd May 21 echoes a profound concern of the Founders as the Constitutional Convention opened 200 years ago For the Founders were divided between antiFederalists who believed that classical republican character and virtue  the willingness of the individual to sacrifice his private interests for the good of the community  ought to form the basis of the new American regime and the Federalists who subscribed to the new science of politics which held that selfinterest was the necessary and proper foundation of public life The Federalist conception came to dominate the Constitution reflects an attempt to channel mens passions and interests in the cause of stable liberal democracy But there remained many who worried that a utilitarian solution was not enough But what bound virtually all Americans together was exactly what Professor Brinkley finds missing today  something transcendent in which to believe They believed in God whether the personal God of the Bible or Natures God of the Declaration of Independence Even the unreligious like Jefferson believed that the only firm basis for the liberties of the nation rested on the conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God and that they are not to be violated without his wrath Religion specifically Protestant Christianity set the context of loyalties and obligations within which the quest for interest would operate Religion framed the essential standards of personal and civic conduct However at the same time the Founders recognized the indispensability of religion they were aware of the convulsiveness of sectarian religion Madison the architect of the Constitution saw religion much oftener a motive to oppression than a restraint from it Thus the perennial problem of religion American history is replete with attempts to find an appropriate civil religion which would foster civic virtue without promoting sectarian strife As Professor Brinkley notes as recently as the early 1960s there was a commonly accepted definition of America as a nation a meaningful American public philosophy The causes for the breakdown were multitudinous and complex but the resulting aimlessness and emptiness that Professor Brinkley finds is clear Professor Brinkley also rightly scores Presidential aspirants for offering narrow technical solutions to the nations sundry problems what is needed is a coherent and compelling American public philosophy Americans have always considered themselves a chosen people It would be well for our presumptive Presidents to ask if we are indeed chosen If so to do what How well are we doing How can and must we do better Is there a civil theologian among our leaders who can forge a new American consensus a new covenant Or are Americans as Mercy Warren feared in 1798 too selfish and avaricious for a virtuous republic and too divided by religion on fractious issues like abortion school prayer and creationism Alexis de Tocqueville the most astute observer of the American character offered a guide in the 1830s that perhaps seems naive in this age but is worth pondering He paints the portrait of the unbeliever who no longer thinking religion true still considers it useful GERALD DE MAIO DOUGLAS MUZZIO New York May 26 1987 The writers are associate professors of political science at Baruch College

WOMAN'S RIGHT UPHELD ON SUING OVER STRESS FROM ABORTION By MARK A. UHLIG,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/10/nyregion/woman-s-right-upheld-on-suing-over-stress-from-abortion-by-mark-a-uhlig.html,New Yorks highest court ruled today that a Long Island woman who submitted to an abortion on the erroneous advice of her physician could seek damages for the emotional trauma of the abortion which she regarded as sinful In a 5to1 decision the State Court of Appeals ruled that the woman Carmen Martinez had a legal right to sue for damages because the breach of duty that resulted in the abortion had directly harmed her emotionally The threepage ruling which reversed a lowercourt decision establishes a new exception to the prevailing legal concept that damages for emotional trauma may not be recovered by one person for injuries that are sustained by another In the past the concept has been applied solely in cases involving injury to fetuses Lawyers familiar with the case said the ruling might also strengthen the grounds for lawsuits by people who suffered emotional trauma from mistaken or unnecessary medical procedures even when the procedures did not result in physical injuries The Psychological Injury Ordering the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court to reconsider Mrs Martinezs suit the court ruled The emotional distress for which she seeks recovery does not derive from what happened to the fetus it derives from the psychological injury directly caused by her agreeing to an act which as the jury found was contrary to her firmly held beliefs The decision was opposed by Judge Vito J Titone In a twopage dissent he wrote We have never gone so far as to suggest that tort compensation could be had for emotional distress derived from the guilt resulting from performing an act contrary to ones convictions because negligently advised to do so Mrs Martinez a homemaker in Elmont became pregnant while under medication for a glandular problem On the advice of her physician she underwent an abortion Jan 13 1979 According to her lawyer Mrs Martinez a practicing Roman Catholic strongly resisted the idea of an abortion She agreed to the procedure the lawyer said when her obstetrician was informed by specialists at the Long Island JewishHillside Medical Center that her medication a cortisone derivative Dexamethasone could produce severe birth defects causing the child to be born with an abnormally small brain or no brain at all Recomputation of Risk Two days after the abortion however it was discovered that the dosage used to compute the potential danger was more than 2000 times larger than Mrs Martinez actually received making the risk of birth defects much smaller than first thought She felt that she had murdered a healthy baby Mrs Martinezs lawyer Malachy J Duffy said He added that his client had required five years of psychotherapy to recover from the depression and guilt caused by her decision In a negligence suit filed Oct 18 1980 a jury awarded Mrs Martinez and her husband who have four other children a total of 275000 in damages from the obstetrician Dr Anita Borg and the hospital The award was reduced to 150000 by the trial judge Lawyers for the hospital appealed the verdict to the Appellate Division which overturned it on the ground that Mrs Martinez could not recover damages for emotional distress from a medical procedure that had not caused her direct physical harm Under the ruling today the suit will be returned to the Appellate Division to reconsider the facts

'AS SIMPLE AS GOOD AGAINST EVIL',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/14/books/as-simple-as-good-against-evil.html,SMALL SACRIFICES A True Story of Passion and Murder By Ann Rule Illustrated 487 pp New York NAL Books 1895 ALTHOUGH we are curious about any act of extreme violence most of us want to be reassured about two things that we couldnt commit such an act ourselves and that it couldnt happen to us or those close to us For the crime writer the first is a simple matter of telling a story about an offender who despite superficial similarities is not really like us at all The second is much harder for feeling assured that a violent crime wont happen among us takes more than knowing that a particular criminal has been locked up It takes genuine understanding of both the doer and the deed so that in another instance we can see the violence rising  whether in ourselves or in another  and contain it or at least get out of its way The more brutal and bizarre the crime the greater our need for such reassurance It is no wonder that Ann Rule who in The Stranger Beside Me tracked the career of the serial killer Ted Bundy  one among a growing number of such grisly psychopaths  should now turn to a rare and appalling kind of homicide the attempt by a young mother to kill her three children Diane Downs 27 told Springfield Ore police on May 19 1983 that a bushy haired stranger had waved down her car on a deserted road and shot her sleeping children As doctors worked to save them  her 7yearold daughter died while her 8yearold daughter and 3yearold son survived but remain badly disabled  the mother said I hope my cars OK Does it have any bullet holes in it Shocked investigators set out to prove that the shooter was Diane Downs So Ms Rules account is not a whodunit but an oldfashioned police procedural a weknowwhodunit buthowwegonnaproveit Its hero is Fred Hugi a childless district attorney who vows to avenge the maimed children and their murdered sister tirelessly guides the yearlong investigation and successfully prosecutes Ms Downs in court She got life plus 50 years Mr Hugis unrelenting crusade as simple as good against evil is enough to make the book a pageturner despite some shopworn characters and weary prose borrowed from cop fiction Fred Hugi believed absolutely that what he was doing was right  that he had no other way to go He had someone to answer to and if he lost he would lose big The book verges on more Diane Downs a compulsive talker journalkeeper and writer of love letters taped countless interviews with police and press and at her trial was on the stand for almost five days This extraordinary record provides some vivid fragments of her life An incest victim Ms Downs married to escape and became a battered wife She ran away from her husband many times shot at him and tried repeatedly to kill herself She had an abortion then to make cosmic amends became a surrogate mother The clinic for surrogate parents simply sent her from psychiatrist to psychiatrist until one OKd her Neglecting her children she ricocheted through a series of fast affairs with married men though she didnt like men sex or herself In addition during her brief career as a mother she moved often enlisted in the Army delivered mail got a divorce went to night school plotted arson learned to fly drank too much opened her own surrogacy business planned to become a doctor so she could live in a big house and shortly before she was arrested for murder deliberately got pregnant again But Ms Rule doesnt pursue the stranger inside Diane Downs Instead she falls back to a simpler scenario in which nice guys are manipulated by a scheming woman an incurable sociopath an enigma with talon nails It is impossible to know she says whether Diane Downss psychopathology arose from sexual abuse  if indeed she was abused as a child  or whether she was simply born a bad seed Ms Rule writes More than one rational forensic psychiatrist has said flatly Some children are simply born evil They start out evil and they remain evil  We are back in the familiar and tidy world of the good prosecutor and the bad woman outraged and titillated by the crime gratified by justice done and  though unenlightened  more or less safe Buried like a bullet in woodwork is the wretched edifying story of Diane Downs You have to dig that out for yourself

POLITICS AND PRAYER: WOMEN ON A CRUSADE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/15/arts/politics-and-prayer-women-on-a-crusade.html,The 13 women sat around a kitchen table their heads bowed their hands clasped praying aloud Our Father intoned Yvonne Axiotis we pray for our school committee our mayor our congressmen and senators Show them the ugliness that is tearing apart our society Give our President health and clarity of mind for he comes up against so many enemies And Mrs Axiotis added reverently Give his wife the wisdom to be a godly wife The occasion was the monthly meeting of the Springfield Mass branch of Concerned Women of America one of the fastestgrowing organizations of the New Right political movement The topic of the evening How to prevent a healthcare clinic from opening in a local high school The women said they feared it would foster promiscuity among students and diminish parental control So they prayed for holy boldness in pursuit of their cause and debated what arguments to marshal in their campaign A Moral Path In other cities and towns local concerns are different but the primary goals of the organization prevail wherever it has chapters to steer the nation onto the path of traditional moral values based on the Scriptures and to restore the family to its place as the preeminent unit of society Despite its clearly religious approach the organization is steering clear of the controversy about Tammy and Jim Bakker and their PTL ministry The organizations advisory council includes Macel Falwell and Frances Swaggart the wives of the fundamentalist ministers Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart To pursue its goals Concerned Women of America combines oldfashioned prayer with modern political strategy letterwriting campaigns with litigation Now in its ninth year the organization known as CWA said it has 573000 members in 1800 groups called PrayerAction chapters According to its tally it is larger than the National Organization for Women the League of Women Voters and the National Womens Political Caucus combined But critics question the way it counts its membership anyone who has ever paid the 15 annual dues remains on the rolls even if the membership is not renewed If we used the same methods we would be in the millions said Eleanor C Smeal president of NOW Concerned Women has an annual budget of 6 million collected almost exclusively officers said through dues and contributions Beverly LaHaye the organizations 58yearold founder who was recently granted life tenure as its president said that when she was first motivated to take action in 1978 she had no premonition that she would someday lead a national group with a staff of 25 in Washington Alarmed by the prospect of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution Mrs LaHaye who was then living in San Diego decided something had to be done to prevent its passage Up to then she had devoted herself solely to the role of wife and mother of four Her husband Tim LaHaye a Baptist minister had organized the California branch of the Moral Majority and the Institute for Creation Research to rebut the theory of evolution The couple conducted programs called Family Life Seminars and wrote books about sexuality in marriage Concern About Amendment I began to question some of the churchwomen in my community about what they knew about the equal rights amendment Mrs LaHaye said in a recent interview in her office in Washington Phyllis Schlaflys conservative lobbying group the Eagle Forum had already been established but it was not touching the women in my community Mrs LaHaye said It was as if the churchwomen had stuck their heads in the sand about the ERA she said She and six friends decided to conduct a rally against the proposed amendment in a theater and got in touch with local churches We were a churchgoing group and we were trying to reach Christian churchwomen she said That night we had 1200 people We were shocked Then we offered to put together moral questionandanswer programs for clubs and Bible study groups and we did 66 meetings in three months Though tax exempt Concerned Women is permitted under law to do some lobbying it has trained volunteers around the country and has one professional parttime lobbyist in Washington Along with the Eagle Forum it is given credit for the defeat of a proposed state equal rights amendment in Vermont last year The campaign was bitter and Concerned Women was accused by NOW of fiscal improprieties and of distorting the potential effects of the proposed amendment With time the scope of the organizations issues has broadened It opposes abortion rights sexeducation courses that do not teach moral values condom advertising on television a bill to require companies to give parental leave equal pay for men and women doing comparable work and unisex insurance rates It supports a strong military system and President Reagans Strategic Defense Initiative aid to the Nicaraguan contras antiabortion legislation mandatory AIDS blood testing for marriagelicense applicants and antiobscenity laws It also works for human rights of Soviet citizens mainly Christians imprisoned for their religious beliefs Aid for Underprivileged This month Mrs LaHaye announced that a new department had been formed to provide humanitarian aid education food and clothing to underprivileged people in the United States and abroad But it is in the legal arena that Concerned Women has had the most impact and where it provokes the most worry among its opponents Its legal division takes cases involving what it considers the preservation of religious freedom and the protection of parental rights It maintains a staff in Washington of three fulltime and three parttime lawyers and is planning a national network of legal offices similar to those operated by the American Civil Liberties Union to be called the American Justice League Of the 14 cases in which Concerned Women has involved itself in four years none has provoked more attention than Mozert v Hawkins County in Tennessee Seven families in the rural town of Church Hill Tenn sued the school system to obtain alternative textbooks for their children The parents asserted that the reading series used in the schools included themes  pacifism evolution feminism and disobedience of parents among them  that violated their religious principles A Federal District Court judge ruled last October that the children could be excused from classes that were to use material that their parents found objectionable and that the children could be taught reading at home An appeal is to be heard July 9 in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati We think there are increasing instances when the rights of conservative Christians are abused said Jordan Lorence a staff lawyer So religiousliberty cases constitute the bulk of our work But we have an itch to become involved more in prolife litigation Admiration and Opposition Wherever they are involved activists from Concerned Women Mrs LaHaye in particular generate both admiration and opposition Anthony T Podesta president of People for the American Way a liberal lobbying group that paid for the school boards defense in the Tennessee book case called Concerned Women sophisticated and well financed For example he said Pat Robertson filed a lawsuit in Alabama to ban books outright Beverly LaHaye filed suit asking for alternative readers That is more shrewd and subtle Her position seems more sympathetic so it makes those of us on the other side carry a heavier burden Phyllis Schlafly and Beverly LaHaye work on the same issues compete for the same members and same dollars Mr Podesta said The difference is that Phyllis dissects an issue legally while Beverly prays that it will be defeated Indeed when Concerned Women does not prevail that too is part of Gods greater plan its adherents believe God did not put us here to win the battle Mrs Axiotis said at the meeting in her home The battle is His We are just the foot soldiers So if the school clinic does open it is not because we lost but because its Gods plan
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/17/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,LIKE many American women I know a good bit more than Id like about birth control much of it garnered from books magazines telephone calls to friends and raunchy conversations at bridal showers I remember in high school when a classmate began taking the pill and suddenly started to look like a balloon at the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade I remember when the women in my college dormitory gritted their teeth and had a plastic article that looked as if it had been made by Mattel placed inside their bodies And I remember an absolutely uproarious allfemale brunch where a friend described her first experience with a contraceptive device which shot out a bathroom window into the college quadrangle She never retrieved it I wouldnt have either The only form of birth control none of us talked about much was the condom because precious few of us had ever used or seen one except at fraternity house water balloon fights The most we had heard a man say on the subject of birth control of any kind was You took care of this right Condoms are of national interest now because they might slow the spread of AIDS and while I think this is all to the good something about it makes me furious I know that the threat of death is more serious than pain pelvic disease or infertility but I really wish someone had thought about a campaign for condoms 15 years ago Perhaps the posters could have carried a picture of the Dalkon Shield Its a horriblelooking thing that IUD like one of those oversize pictures of a tick with its fat round body and splayed plastic legs But its even more horrible to talk to women who used it and who weep as they speak who have had ectopic pregnancies that blew their Fallopian tubes apart or pelvic disease that left them with scar tissue If we knew then what we know now perhaps theyd be having children instead of surgery If we knew then what we know now perhaps there would have been condom commercials encouraging men to give the women you love a break  use a condom But when we were becoming sexually active condoms were a joke and the joke was on us Most of the time women had sole responsibility for birth control But now as then some men do not use condoms because they are sort of a drag as one man told me as opposed to birth control for women which has sometimes led to stroke or sterility Perhaps this is changing since dying of AIDS is obviously much more of a drag than using a condom But some heterosexual men and women still seem more interested in denial than protection much less male contraception Recently I talked to the doctor who runs the health services office for a womens college She said that many students were asking the clinic for condoms I also talked to students and said I was pleased that while protecting their lives they were also persuading the men to participate in birth control I was somehow not surprised when this statement turned out to be wrong Some of the women had got condoms and then stashed them in their underwear drawer And there they sat right next to the little wheel of pills or the plastic diaphragm case These women were confident enough in their relationships to sleep with their boyfriends confident enough to assume their boyfriends did not have AIDS but not confident enough to ask those boyfriends to do something they might not want to do The women too had heard that condoms were kind of a drag Ive never met a woman who exactly loved her method of birth control but that doesnt seem to have inhibited women from using it The bottom line has always been that this is because we are the ones who get pregnant which is true But pregnancy and birth and all they entail have changed in the past 15 years We have seen men go to court to halt abortions and adoptions insisting that fathers are just as important as mothers We have seen the presence of fathers in the delivery room change from a curiosity to a commonplace When the pregnancy test is positive we even say that we are pregnant But while society has come to expect participatory fathers it does not expect participatory birth control Women who take the pill dont blow up like a balloon the way they once did nor can women purchase an IUD in the United States because of the sheer number of lawsuits brought against their manufacturers But one thing hasnt changed women still take care of birth control Women take care of business Thats why condom manufacturers are marketing directly to us now even though most of the American men who have contracted AIDS dont even sleep with women We took care of business when we were trying to inhibit conception I suppose everyone assumes that well take care of business when its time to inhibit death too I suppose everyone is right It still makes me angry The manufacturers insert in a package of birthcontrol pills says you should take them under a doctors supervision They can be associated with serious side effects which may be fatal the insert says including blood clots in the lungs and brain liver tumors high blood pressure gallbladder disease None of those are associated with condom use
O'CONNOR AIDE PICKED TO HEAD SYRACUSE REGION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/17/nyregion/o-connor-aide-picked-to-head-syracuse-region.html,Bishop Joseph T OKeefe who runs the daytoday activities of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York as the second in command to John Cardinal OConnor was named yesterday by Pope John Paul II as Bishop of the Diocese of Syracuse The appointment gave Cardinal OConnor the most important post to fill since he became Archbishop three years ago Bishop OKeefe who developed a good working relationship with the Cardinal was appointed Vicar General by Terence Cardinal Cooke in 1978 In Syracuse Bishop OKeefe who is 68 years old will manage a much smaller diocese With 490 priests and 340000 Roman Catholics the Diocese is onefifth the size of the New York Archdiocese In a news conference in Syracuse Bishop OKeefe said the job before him had nothing to do with the size of the flock Under 3 Cardinals I come as a pastor to spiritually care for the people of Syracuse the lifelong New Yorker said Spiritual needs are the same no matter where you are The Bishop who will be installed in August at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception succeeds Bishop Frank Harrison who is retiring at the age of 74 Working under three Cardinals Bishop OKeefe was a parish priest teacher administrator and  for six months between archbishops  the head of the archdiocese In recent months he took an unusually strong public stand and clashed with Governor Cuomo on Catholic teaching on abortion Bishop OKeefe with twinkling blue eyes and a shock of white hair pushed back over a receding hairline has a reputation for being a fair and efficient behindthescenes administrator He was popular with priests and until recently his office was the place where the 2427 priests in the archdiocese would go when they had a problem Ordained by Spellman That system changed somewhat when Cardinal OConnor set aside one day a week to meet with priests Many priests meet with him on the designated day Wednesdays Bishop OKeefe was born in Manhattan in 1919 and grew up on the West Side He was ordained by Francis Cardinal Spellman in 1948 and after working in Catholic schools and parishes became an administrator at the headquarters of the archdiocese in 1965 In October 1983 after the death of Cardinal Cooke Bishop OKeefe was chosen by a panel of priests and bishops to lead the diocese temporarily He remained in that capacity until the arrival of Cardinal OConnor Last September the Bishop issued a directive asking all priests in the archdiocese to bar from speaking in parishes those who disagreed with orthodox Catholic teaching Governor Cuomo protested the policy saying there should be room for greater diversity of opinion in the church We lay people he said have a right to be heard

Questioners,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/weekinreview/the-iran-contra-panel-in-profile-what-the-questions-tell-about-the-questioners.html,AFTER six weeks of hearings into the Irancontra affair the members of the joint Congressional committees have begun to emerge as familiar personalities Some have been eloquent like Representative Lee H Hamilton the chairman of the House panel Some have proved to be doughty defenders of the Reagan Administration like Senator Orrin G Hatch A few like Senator George J Mitchell have pursued a consistent thread of inquiry And one Representative Les Aspin has been notable for his absence In all the questions and sometimes the soliloquies of certain legislators have given shape to the proceedings What follows is a guide to some of the Senators and Representatives who have made important contributions so far and who are likely to remain in the spotlight when the hearings resume Tuesday DANIEL K INOUYE Chairman of the Senate panel is a 62yearold Democrat from Hawaii    A 24year veteran of the Senate was a member of the Watergate committee 13 years ago    A reserved man he has helped run the hearings behind the scenes trying to keep them as bipartisan as possible    Pressing to finish hearings before the August recess has limited his own questions so far but colleagues say he will be tough as one of the main questioners when Rear Adm John M Poindexter the former national security adviser appears early in July WARREN B RUDMAN Vice chairman of the Senate panel is a New Hampshire Republican    56 years old    One of the sponsors of the GrammRudmanHollings law mandating annual steps to reduce the budget deficit    A former attorney general of New Hampshire who takes pride in his prosecutorial skills he has emerged as an outspoken alter ego for the quiet Inouye    Among the committees Republicans the most forceful critic of Iran and contra operations    Active role has prompted reminiscences of the way Howard H Baker Jr gained prominence in Watergate hearings before becoming Senate Republican leader GEORGE J MITCHELL Democratic Senator from Maine    At 53 a former Federal prosecutor and district judge    A liberal was

Irancontra operation and by Administration spokesmens misleading statements to Congress    Was particularly upset by the testimony of Maj Gen Richard V Secord in one of the hearings most theatrical moments thus far challenged General Secord to prove avowed patriotism by opening up bank records for committee inspection    A smooth questioner with folksy turn of speech ORRIN G HATCH Utah

of center among Senate Republicans though he backed contra aid    During the hearings he has emerged as a skeptic at one point questioning whether he could believe the testimony of any witness PAUL S TRIBLE JR Republican Senator from Virginia is a former Assistant United States Attorney    At 39 the youngest member of the Senate panel and also the biggest surprise    Has been lowkeyed conservative with a voting record loyal to President Reagan but was transformed in hearings into a bold questioner who pressed Administration witnesses hard    Clue to change may be predictions that he faces a tough reelection campaign next year against Charles S Robb the Democratic former Governor LEE H HAMILTON Democrat is chairman of House panel    56 years old tall with a crew cut    Little known outside Congress and his heavily Republican Indiana district    Colleagues say he displayed integrity in a decade as head of Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East    Outspoken in

POLITICS; VOTE-GETTERS SNUB NAASSAU DEMOCRATS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/nyregion/politics-vote-getters-snub-naassau-democrats.html,ATTEMPTING to end 17 years of Republican domination of Nassau County Democrats had such difficulty finding candidates that they were forced to select second choices for at least three of the five top election contests this November Among those refusing to take on what Democrats admit will be underfinanced uphill campaigns were three proven votegetters Assemblymen Arthur J Kremer and Lewis J Yevoli and Mayor Vincent Suozzi of Glen Cove and Richard M Kessel executive chairman of the State Consumer Protection Board who a few years ago was rejected by the party when he wanted to run for county executive This year Mr Kessel did the rejecting The reluctance was particularly noteworthy because only one of the five Republican candidates for county executive and supervisors of Hempstead where there are two supervisors North Hempstead and Oyster Bay is a fullterm incumbent Three of the five are interim incumbents and the fifth is a town councilman These are Democratic candidates in the local elections that are more important for party building than Presidential or state elections County Executive  Raymond B Grunewald of Greenvale a 59yearold lawyer and former Federal prosecutor who ran unsuccessfully for county comptroller in 1985 Hempstead Presiding Supervisor  Edward A Grause of East Meadow the 64yearold Hempstead Democratic leader who holds a patronage job with the countys Board of Elections Hempstead Supervisor  Viki DeJong of Westbury a civic activist making her first run for public office Oyster Bay Supervisor  Leonard Austin a Farmingdale lawyer who has run unsuccessfully for several posts including Oyster Bay supervisor North Hempstead Supervisor Ben Zwirn a 36yearold lawyer and businessman who switched back to the Democratic Party the day he was designated by the Democrats He had left the party three years ago because of dissatisfaction with the party in his hometown of Port Washington Mr Grunewald who will be leading the Nassau Democratic ticket in his challenge of the interim County Executive Thomas S Gulotta acknowledged that he would have deferred to the Democratic public officials as candidates because of their greater name recognition He said he had told the new Nassau Democratic chairman John Matthews If you want me Im here Mr Grause who will be challenging the most powerful Nassau Republican  Joseph N Mondello the interim Hempstead Presiding Supervisor as well as the County Republican chairman  said he had sought out a number of highly qualified individuals for the Democratic nomination for presiding supervisor before selecting himself Id hate to think Im running because I was the last person out of the room he said Mr Grause said that in his campaign he would point up Mr Mondellos dual role as party and public official although other Nassau Democrats said that Mr Grauses dual role would deprive Democrats of that issue Mr Grause said he would resign as town leader if he were elected presiding supervisor Mrs DeJong the candidate for Hempstead supervisor will be opposing another interim Republican appointee Gregory Peterson who like Mr Mondello has moved up from town councilman In Oyster Bay Democrats had hoped to persuade Mr Yevoli to run for supervisor in a year when the incumbent Joseph Colby confronted with Federal and local investigations of corruption in the town government decided under pressure from Republican leaders not to seek reelection Despite that seeming advantage Mr Yevoli who like Mr Kremer would not have had to surrender his Assembly seat to run viewed the Republican Party as too formidable He also maintained that even if a Democrat were elected supervisor he would be confronted with a Republican majority on the Town Board Nassau Democratic leaders are still hopeful that Mr Yevoli will change his mind He could do so as late as midJuly In that case Mr Austin Democratic leaders said would be willing to step aside The Republican candidate for supervisor in Oyster Bay is Angelo Delligatti a town councilman The only elected Republican incumbent among the five top officeholders is North Hempstead Supervisor John Kiernan However Nassau Democratic leaders are most optimistic about this race at the moment because of Mr Zwirns personal financial assets and his contacts among Republicans while he was a member of that party Despite what many politicians including Democrats believe was an inauspicious start Mr Matthews the new Democratic leader was enthusiastic over his ticket He described the Democratic candidates as fighters and said he hoped to raise at least 150000 for the campaign in addition to any money the candidates themselves received Republicans are likely to raise and spend at least triple that amount Mr Matthews himself ran for county executive twice and lost to Francis T Purcell in 1985 It was Mr Purcells resignation that started the Republican job switches at the county level and in Hempstead One key to Mr Matthewss effort to revitalize the Nassau Democratic Party after his initial problems with candidate selections is whether such Democrats as Mr Kremer Mr Yevoli and Mr Kessel will actively campaign and raise money for the Democratic ticket  in effect putting their own reputations on the line Mr Kessel for one wont be much help He said that in his state post my role is to be as nonpartisan as possible He added that his refusal to run this year did not mean he was ruling out future candidacies He said he foresaw that Nassaus problems particularly what he said was its growing urbanization would worsen in the future This isnt the last county executive election Mr Kessel said The leading Democratic votegetter in the county District Attorney Denis E Dillon has been criticized by Mr Grunewald for his antiabortion views as well as his candidacy for Governor on the RighttoLife line last year against the Democratic incumbent Governor Cuomo Mr Grunewald who is somewhat of a flamboyant orator echoed past Nassau Democratic candidates as he criticized the Nassau Republican machine that operates Nassau County governments as if they were fiefdoms He said that the series of job changes amounted to the Republicans granting incumbency to each other and using the public financial trough as their private watering holes He said he would make an issue of the Republicans failure to deal with garbage disposal potential water shortages choking traffic and lack of lowincome housing The ultimate issue is the lack of real leadership and planning Mr Grunewald said His principal running mate Mr Grause who has been a Democratic Party activist for 30 years also talked of water garbage and housing among other issues Asked why such issues had not helped elect Democrats in the past Mr Grause said that too many Nassau voters look at the grass see that its green and say everything is all right
Jews Are Aghast at the Pope's Invitation to Waldheim,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/opinion/jews-are-aghast-at-the-popes-invitation-to-waldheim.html,LEAD In September 1971 in a synagogue in Paris there was a new beginning in the often painful history of the relations between Jews and Roman Catholics For the first time ever the Vatican had sent an official delegation to the table to meet with an equally weighty group that spoke for the major Jewish organizations In September 1971 in a synagogue in Paris there was a new beginning in the often painful history of the relations between Jews and Roman Catholics For the first time ever the Vatican had sent an official delegation to the table to meet with an equally weighty group that spoke for the major Jewish organizations In three days most of the issues that continued to preoccupy Catholics and Jews from antiSemitism to abortion were aired and the delegates discovered how long the journey was yet to be before Catholics and Jews could wipe away the legacy of centuries of persecution and disrespect The moment of that meeting that I cannot forget was an intervention by Archbishop Roger Etchegaray of Marseilles who is now a Cardinal at the Vatican He turned to me at a break in the proceedings and said The issues are not important old and tragic though they may be At this meeting we must begin to look into each others hearts and begin to feel each others pain Pope John Paul II has now granted Kurt Waldheim an official audience He has done this even though  or perhaps because  every civilized government will have nothing to do with this President of Austria who lied about his Nazi past I shall heed Cardinal Etchegarays injunction and try first to look into the heart of the Pope Mr Waldheim is a practicing Catholic and no matter what his state of grace he is entitled to the pastoral concern of the church Austria is a very Catholic country and it cannot be excluded from the love of Peters successor But must the Pope be his pastor Is there no priest in all of Austria to minister to Mr Waldheim Is there no other way of saying to the Austrian people that they are cherished sons of the church The Vatican now says it is surprised and grieved by the subsequent outcry Let me then ask my Catholic brothers to understand the pain in a Jewish heart I speak not of the pain of the centuries but of the hurts of recent years We have rejoiced in the zeal of the church and especially that of the present Pope in the battle against antiSemitism We know of quiet interventions for people in trouble and it would be wrong even at an angry moment not to acknowledge this fraternity But our discomforts have been growing We are ever more convinced that in the Nazi era and in the immediate years thereafter the church on balance worried more about fleeing Nazis than about dying Jews Pope John Paul II continues to withhold diplomatic relations from Israel He recently beatified Edith Stein as a Catholic martyr when all Jews including members of her family and many Catholics said publicly that the death of this nun of Jewish origin was part of the Nazi persecution of the Jews and that she was deported while agencies of her own order were dilatory in offering her haven The memory of the Holocaust and the miracle of Israels existence are the two high dramas one tragic and the other glorious of our Jewish lives We know that the leader of our Catholic brothers remains deeply shaken by his own youthful memories of Nazioccupied Poland and that he is glad that Jews are no longer hunted but we fear that the Pope does not feel our pain as we feel it or share in our great joy in Israel as we do There is burning outrage in the Jewish world at the invitation to Kurt Waldheim and the bodies that began the formal dialogue with the church are now asking whether this relationship can continue especially since the Pope has asked that the current topic be the Holocaust In recent months Jewish leaders have indeed argued with one another about the tactics to be used in the battle with Mr Waldheim but the Jewish world is united without dissent that a man of his murky past who looked away while Jews were murdered and Yugoslav villages were burned is not morally acceptable as a world leader In this they are joined by all Western opinion except for a dividedAustria I cannot believe that the Pope expects to reverse this judgment or even to unite Austria by having the Swiss Guard salute Mr Waldheim as he arrives at the Vatican gate My heart tells me that it is not so simple  at least I hope so Otherwise this incident will be no isolated tempest that will blow over It will poison the highest levels of JewishCatholic relations I hope that the Pope has invited Mr Waldheim to provide him with a graceful way of leaving the Presidency of Austria If that is the penance that the Pope is imposing he will serve Mr Waldheim and Austria and both Catholics and Jews The Pope will then be seen as the leader of a church that wants to turn away from Mr Waldheims sorry past and to confront its own collective conscience A simple whitewash by the Pope of the evasive Mr Waldheim is unthinkable I await good news from Rome the news of a courageous leader acting for the future because I tremble at the thought of another regressive and angry era in the relations between Jews and the church
"ONE JUDGE, ONE VOTE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/books/one-judge-one-vote.html,THE BURGER YEARS Rights and Wrongs in the Supreme Court 19691986 Edited by Herman Schwartz 293 pp New York Elisabeth Sifton BooksViking 2295 AS a matter of convenience we tend to mark epochs in the Supreme Courts history by reference to the tenure of the Chief Justice referring to the Marshall Court the Warren Court now the Rehnquist Court These divisions are often artificial and misleading however overstating the intellectual imprint of the Chief Justice and understating the contributions of other Justices who have more powerfully influenced the Courts direction The Burger Years is a collection of 15 retrospective essays by different authors of the work of the Supreme Court during Warren E Burgers 17year tenure What the essays reveal is that the Burger Court has been for many years the Rehnquist Court The editor Herman Schwartz in an excellent opening essay sets the tone for the pieces that follow a tone decidedly antagonistic to the Edwin MeeseWilliam Rehnquist axis of jurisprudence Mr Schwartz and his contributors treat the Constitution as a document intended to invite what Representative Thaddeus Stevens in 1866 called the advancing progress of a higher morality In cases covering the spectrum of Supreme Court litigation  freedom of speech religion privacy race and sex discrimination criminal justice regulation of business and labormanagement relations  the Burger years were a series of battles between Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr and Justice Rehnquist for control of the swing votes in the Courts center Justice Rehnquist was in the minority on affirmative action abortion and school prayer but on the whole he won more battles than he lost Shifting alignments in the center of the Court produced a pattern of middling meandering conservatism The Court tended to avoid directly sentencing key Warrenera decisions to death opting rather to render them impotent limiting their reach with procedural and remedial circumscriptions and revising and eviscerating their central rationales An illusion of continuity with the Warren years was created but by slow degrees the past was displaced by a new jurispruden tial agenda Prior decisions that were originally based on relatively firm philosophical principles were recast as decisions based on empirical costbenefit judgments The Burger Court would then reassess the relative costs and benefits to strike a new balance substantially undermining the effectiveness of the Warren precedent Once pragmatic calculations of pluses and minuses replaced these anchoring philosophical principles Warren Court rulings began slipping away Yale Kamisar in his chapter on criminal procedure furnishes the most dramatic illustrations of this process The now famous police warnings set forth in the Miranda ruling originally were conceived as required by the Constitution to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial police interrogation In a decision written by Justice Rehnquist however the Court recast those warnings stating that they were not themselves required by the Constitution A mere Miranda violation is not necessarily a constitutional violation the Court stated if the defendants incriminating confession was not involuntary SIMILARLY the exclusionary rule under which illegally seized evidence is excluded from admission in court originally was grounded on the principle that in a free society the government ought not capitalize on its own illegalities and that the criminal justice system should avoid sanctioning and ratifying unconstitutional police conduct by forbidding the introduction of evidence that is tainted by official lawlessness The Burger Court rejected the core premise of the exclusionary rule replacing it with a cost benefit analysis in which the freeing of a clearly guilty criminal was balanced against the incremental deterrent impact on police misconduct of excluding the evidence This process worked inexorably to favor the prosecution for the Court was disposed to treat police efficiency in combating crime as a more palpable interest than the speculative utility of the exclusionary rule as a deterrent against police misbehavior At times during the Burger years the process of weighing competing interests was manipulated with only barely disguised duplicity The Court as it had done from 1900 to 1937 showed a renewed interest in the protection of entrepreneurial liberty In the antitrust area the Court consistently avoided rules of per se illegality in favor of a rule of reason test for measuring allegedly anticompetitive business conduct a balancing approach in which business defendants usually won In the labormanagement area the Court was markedly more receptive to challenges by employers to decisions of the National Labor Relations Board than to challenges by unions The Court tended to limit the scope of the securities laws and was particularly sensitive to the manner in which securities fraud litigation may be used as an oppressive device to blackmail corporate defendants into settlement of groundless claims In 1975 for example Justice Rehnquist wrote of the in terrorem effect of securities litigation stating that the prospect of extensive deposition of defendants officers and associates and the concomitant opportunity for extensive discovery of business documents is a common occurrence This was precisely the argument advanced by the news organizations in libel cases in which enormously punishing discovery costs are often borne by a press defending largely groundless libel suits Yet the Burger Court consistently refused to grant the press any special dispensation from generally applicable civil litigation rules The Court found the big chill of litigation on securities transactions more pernicious than on the exercise of First Amendment rights There was at least a certain consistency to this inconsistency Civil liberties usually lost In a 1976 case for example the Court rejected a newspaper photographers claim that his constitutional rights were violated when police chiefs circulated a flier erroneously depicting him as an active shoplifter Justice Rehnquist wrote that the frequently drastic effect of the stigma which may result from defamation by the government    does not establish that reputation alone    is by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause When media defendants attempted to raise First Amendment defenses to libel claims however the Court treated reputation with nearsacred reverence writing that the individuals right to the protection of his own name reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being  IN a 1979 defamation suit the plantiff had been included in a list of alleged Soviet agents in a book about the KGB The plaintiff had in fact never been convicted of spying but had pleaded guilty to criminal contempt for failing to respond to a New York Federal grand jury subpoena investigating Soviet espionage Fifteen news stories concerning the plaintiff appeared in the New York and Washington press but Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court refused to classify the plaintiff as a public figure which would have triggered special First Amendment protection for the publisher stating that to treat the plaintiff as a public figure would create an open season for all who sought to defame persons convicted of crime When it was police

ABOUT EDUCATION; TEEN-AGERS AND SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/23/science/about-education-teen-agers-and-sex.html,CONCERN about AIDS is forcing the schools to reexamine their response to adolescent sexuality Before the threat of acquired immune deficiency syndrome arose the schools focused almost entirely on teenage pregnancy  how to prevent it or failing that how to deal withteenage mothers and their children The current issue of Kappan a monthly publication for educators carries two indepth articles about schools and adolescent sexuality Neither mentions AIDS but much of the information in each is invaluable for any discussion of the schools potential role in preventing the spread of AIDS Asta M Kenney an associate for policy development at the Alan Guttmacher Institute which deals with issues of family planning writes in one of the articles Teen Pregnancy An Issue for Schools that contrary to wishful thinking sexual activity and pregnancy among high school students can no longer be considered deviant  It is simply too widespread In the other Teen Pregnancy Its Time for the Schools to Tackle the Problem James Buie special projects writer for the Education Research Group a subsidiary of Capitol Publications points to a paradox While more than half the school administrators surveyed favored providing students with birth control devices as part of comprehensive schoolbased health services 96 percent of the nations school districts do nothing of the kind The reason is fear of controversy School administrators are a cautious lot Mr Buie said and understandably so given frequent lack of community support Teenage pregnancy is a desperately serious matter The mothers education is usually curtailed along with their potential for productive and satisfying lives the babies brought up by adolescents often suffer mental and physical damage the nation piles up permanent human and fiscal deficits But the alarming extent of teenage pregnancy now must also be seen as an indicator of the potential exposure of schoolage children and adolescents to AIDS This is why a review of the facts of adolescent sexual activity and the schools role  in preventing it preventing pregnancy and preventing AIDS infection  is crucial About half of American teenagers are sexually active by the time they leave high school and one in four of the girls have had a pregnancy Mr Buie wrote Each year 400000 teenagers have abortions and 470000 most of them unmarried  give birth Onethird of brides under 18 years of age are pregnant leading to many unstable marriages Sex education if it is provided at all often comes only after young people have become sexually active Almost half the first pregnancies among teenagers occur within six months of the first sexual encounter Opponents of sex education and schoolbased clinics charge that providing birth control information and devices sends a message to adolescents that schools and society approve of the adolescents sexual activity Ms Kenney in her article in Kappan challenged this view The rate of teenage pregnancy in the United States is twice as high as in Britain France and Canada and three times as high as in Sweden Those countries with the most liberal attitudes toward sex the most extensive sex education programs and the most easily accessible contraceptive services have the lowest rates of teenage pregnancy abortion and childbearing she wrote BUT opponents of schoolbased efforts insist that the only moral way to deal with the matter is to call for abstinence They applaud President Reagans advice to adolescents Say No  In the July issue of National Review in an article titled Why Johnny Cant Abstain Education Secretary William J Bennett writes that those who urge schools to make contraceptives available betray a view of sex and of life that is dangerous to our children In principle conservatives and liberals might agree that adolescents should defer sexual activity Unfortunately adolescents are influenced by the example of adults and messages from television entertainment Ms Kenney said postponement of sexual activity should be urged as part of the total curriculum and linked to young peoples goals and aspirations in school and life The ability of the school and the family to build teenagers sense of self and of the future will probably have a far greater impact on adolescent behavior than will any short sex education programs she said The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences recently urged the development of schoolbased clinics Now that the threat of AIDS has joined the already serious problem of adolescent pregancy the schools face difficult decisions Whether and how they should offer AIDS virus testing for example requires careful thought Whatever the outcome of that debate the schools will have to play a key role in preventing the spread of a deadly disease
Michigan Legislature Bans Abortion Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/25/us/michigan-legislature-bans-abortion-funds.html,The Michigan Legislature approved a ban on state financing of abortion Tuesday but a judge stayed enforcement of the law until he could rule on a dispute over the effective date Less than two hours after the 66to41 vote in the State House Judge James Giddings of Ingham County Circuit Court issued the temporary restraining order A hearing is scheduled before another judge on Monday Similar legislation has been vetoed 17 times since 1978 by Gov James Blanchard a Democrat and his Republican predecessor William Milliken But this bill faced no threat of a veto because antiabortion campaigners used the State Constitutions provision for voterinitiated legislation Right to Life of Michigan gathered 460000 signatures on petitions favoring the bill The Michigan Constitution requires the Legislature to approve bills originated by the citizenry or to put them before the voters at the next general election Last year Michigan paid about 58 million for some 18600 abortions for poor women It is one of only 14 states that use taxpayer money to finance abortions
RIGHT-TO-DIE RULING STIRS LEGAL AND ETHICAL DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/nyregion/right-to-die-ruling-stirs-legal-and-ethical-debate.html,The New Jersey Supreme Court rulings expanding the right of individuals to refuse lifesustaining medical treatment has renewed debate about the legal and ethical implications of the issue While Wednesdays decisions drew praise today from those who support a patients right to die and angered those who believe the removal of lifesustaining systems constitutes euthanasia they have given those who must deal on a daytoday basis with health care delivery some new guidelines and new problems The court rulings in three cases held that the right of incompetent and terminally ill patients to refuse lifesustaining treatment generally outweighs state interests in preserving life and the treatment policies of medical institutions The court sought to provide broad guidelines for agreement on medical treatment among patients or their families physicians and health care institutions If those parties act in good faith to reach agreement the court ruled they will be immune from civil or criminal liability Answers and Questions Daniel F OConnell the chairman of the State Commission on Legal and Ethical Problems in the delivery of Health Care said the courts rulings answered some questions and raised some others The 27member commission which was created at the request of the court has been studying since last year the legal moral and theological concerns that result from a patients right to refuse treatment The panel expects to issue its first legislative recommendation this summer calling for extending the states powerofattorney statute to cover decisions on medical treatment or for the legalization of living wills in which individuals spell out exactly what they want done in the event they become mentally incompetent Mr OConnell said that until Wednesdays ruling commission members and staff had believed a competent patient could always make medical treatment decisions in any setting However in upholding the right of a terminally ill patient Kathleen Farrell of South Toms River to order the removal of her mechanical respirator the court has thrown in a new requirement that two nonattending physicians take part in the decision if the patient is at home Mr OConnell said This will probably require us to recommend some new legislation Big Big Favor We might come up with other guidelines to cover the situation use the courts guidelines or simply decide that a competent adult does not need to have consultation he said He said however the court did a big big favor for the health care industry by guaranteeing immunity from suits when decisions are made in good faith He said this will remove the pressure on decisionmakers brought by a fear of being sued He said the most troubling part of the decisions dealt with the rights of patients to dictate their own treatment and the health care institutions right to follow its own treatment policies The court said that when a conflict arises the patients rights supersede those of the institution The court said however this did not cover instances where a patient is informed of the institutions policy prior to being admitted Well have to see how this weighing of the rights of patients and health care institutions plays out he said But I believe we will be able to accommodate both sides He said the courts have upheld a personal right to an abortion but has not required all hospitals aside from state hospitals to perform the procedure Directive to Nursing Home In one of three cases ruled on by the court the Lincoln Park Nursing Home was ordered to accede to the wishes of the family of Nancy Ellen Jobes a severely braindamaged 31yearold woman to have her feeding tube removed A trial court granted the familys request to have the tube removed but recognized the nursing homes right not to participate The court said the woman would have to remain connected to the feeding tubes until she could be transferred to another institution that would carry out the familys wishes This echoed what has happened in other state courts most recently this month in New York The New Jersey court ruled however that the nursing home would have to cooperate in the withdrawal of the feeding tube despite its objection on moral grounds that such a step would constitute euthanasia
WHERE HE STOOD: SAMPLES FROM 15 YEARS OF POWELL'S MAJOR OPINIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/us/where-he-stood-samples-from-15-years-of-powell-s-major-opinions.html,AFFIRMATIVE ACTION From Justice Powells controlling opinion in Regents of the University of California v Bakke 1978 supporting the principle of affirmative action while invalidating the program at issue If petitioners purpose is to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as insubstantial but as facially invalid Preferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake This the Constitution forbids The fourth goal asserted by petitioner is the attainment of a diverse student body This clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education Academic freedom though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body The fatal flaw in petitioners preferential program is its disregard of individual rights as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment Such rights are not absolute But when a states distribution of benefits or imposition of burdens hinges on the color of a persons skin or ancestry that individual is entitled to a demonstration that the challenged classification is necessary to promote a substantial state interest EQUAL PROTECTION From a concurring opinion in Plyler v Doe 1982 a 5to4 ruling guaranteeing the right of illegal alien children to a free education in the public schools The classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents These children thus have been singled out for a lifelong penalty and stigma A legislative classification that threatens the creation of an underclass of future citizens and residents cannot be reconciled with one of the fundamental purposes of the 14th Amendment OFFICIAL IMMUNITY From his opinion for the Court in Nixon v Fitzgerald 1982 a 5to4 decision giving former President Richard M Nixon absolute immunity from damage suits growing out of his actions as President The President occupies a unique position in the constitutional scheme Because of the singular importance of the Presidents duties diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government In view of the visibility of his office and the effect of his actions on countless people the President would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil damages Cognizance of this personal vulnerability frequently could distract a President from his public duties to the detriment of not only the President and his office but also the nation that the Presidency was designed to serve ABORTION From his opinion for the Court in City of Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health 1983 a 6to3 decision striking down local restrictions on womens access to abortions These cases come to us a decade after we held in Roe v Wade that the right of privacy grounded in the concept of personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution encompasses a womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy Legislative responses to the Courts decision have required us on several occasions and again today to define the limits of a states authority to regulate the performance of abortions And arguments continue to be made in these cases as well that e erred in interpreting the Constitution Nonetheless the doctrine of stare decisis while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law We respect it today and reaffirm Roe v Wade DEATH PENALTY From his dissenting opinion in Furman v Georgia 1972 in which the Court by a 5to4 vote invalidated the death penalty as it then existed The Courts judgment not only wipes out laws presently in existence but denies to Congress and to the legislatures of the 50 states the power to adopt new policies contrary to the policy selected by the Court In terms of the constitutional role of this Court the impact of the majoritys ruling is all the greater because the decision encroaches upon an area squarely within the historic prerogative of the legislative branch  both state and Federal  to protect the citizenry through the designation of penalties for prohibitable conduct It is the very sort of judgment that the legislative branch is competent to make and for which the judiciary is illequipped Throughout our history Justices of this Court have emphasized the gravity of decisions invalidating legislative judgments admonishing the nine men who sit on this bench of the duty of selfrestraint JUDICIAL RESTRAINT From his concurring opinion in US v Richardson 1974 a 5to4 decision holding that a taxpayer could not sue to force the Central Intelligence Agency to account for its expenditures Repeated and essentially headon confrontations between the lifetenured branch and the representative branches of government will not in the long run be beneficial to either The public confidence essential to the former and the vitality critical to the latter may well erode if we do not exercise selfrestraint in the utilization of our power to negative the actions of the other branches We should be ever mindful of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of government by a nonrepresentative and in large measure insulated judicial branch CHURCHSTATE From his concurring opinion in Aguilar v Felton 1985 a 5to4 decision that struck down the use of Federal funds to pay for remedial education in parochial schools I agree with the Court that in this case the Establishment Clause is violated because there is too great a risk of government entanglement in the administration of the religious schools This risk of entanglement is compounded by the additional risk of political divisiveness stemming from the aid to religion at issue here I do not suggest that at this point in our history the Title I program or similar parochial aid plans could result in the establishment of a state religion There likewise is small chance that these programs would result in significant religious or denominational control over our democratic processes Nonetheless there remains a considerable risk of continuing political strife over the propriety of direct aid to religious schools and the proper allocation of limited governmental resources
"White House Hunts for a Justice, Hoping to Tip Ideological Scales",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/us/white-house-hunts-for-a-justice-hoping-to-tip-ideological-scales.html,The White House started looking for a new Supreme Court Justice today hoping to tip the ideological balance on key issues without generating a protracted confirmation fight with the Democraticcontrolled Senate Aides said the White House recognized that the appointment could prove pivotal in reversing the Courts rulings permitting abortion although President Reagan has not made that a condition of the selection of a successor to Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr But reflecting that aim they said the hope at this stage was to find a sitting judge whose rulings on abortion and other issues could be scrutinized The leading choice according to Administration officials is Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Judge Bork has been critical of the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortions Others judges on a list being used as a starting point in the search by White House officials include J Clifford Wallace of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Patrick E Higginbotham of the Fifth Circuit Ralph K Winter Jr and Roger J Miner of the Second Circuit and Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Administration sources said Response From the Senate If Mr Reagan chooses a strongly conservative candidate to succeed Justice Powell he may have trouble avoiding a lengthy confirmation struggle Senator Joseph R Biden Jr chairman of the Judiciary Committee said today that he would resist any effort by the Administration to impose an ideological agenda upon our jurisprudence The Delaware Democrat who is a candidate for the partys 1988 Presidential nomination said the major issue is whether the Presidents nominee would significantly alter the balance of the Court When we fill this vacancy this one nominee more than any other justice could decide the course of our jurisprudence well into the next century he said Senator Paul Simon of Illinois another member of the Judiciary Committee running for the Democratic Presidential nomination said in a television interview that the committee is not going to rubberstamp anyone and that if the President appoints an ideologue there would be a a difficult confirmation battle Then theres going to be delay he said Then were going to be looking very very closely and the Senate might very well reject a nominee Other senators said however that while the nominee would be scrutinized closely confirmation was likely Factors in the Selection While White House officials acknowledged that it would be impossible to predict how Mr Reagans appointee would rule on abortion or any other issue they said they were using a selection system that had previously resulted in the choice of judges whose rulings have largely reflected the Presidents philosophy The President opposes abortion except to protect the life of the mother The Presidents views on abortion are well known and his nominees have shared his views on that question said one senior White House official The official added that another consideration that was emerging was the fact that Mr Powell from Virginia held the socalled Southern seat on the Court The official said some Congressional leaders were lobbying the White House to appoint a judge from the South Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee said The South is onequarter of the nation in population and area He added I would hope that a Southerner will fill that position Caught by Surprise Justice Powells announcement early today caught the President and White House officials by surprise and made it difficult to predict who would emerge as the eventual choice That left open the possibility that Mr Reagan might abandon his practice of turning to sitting judges the officials said Although Howard H Baker Jr denied that he was a candidate some speculation today focused on him He became White House chief of staff last February and is considered a moderate by many of Mr Reagans conservative supporters I would be hard pressed to figure out what would motivate him said one of Mr Reagans aides of the possibility that Mr Baker might seek the appointment There has not been enough time that has passed for him to make this move Another name mentioned was Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican whose opposition to abortion has been widely applauded by conservatives Still another name being considered is Senator Howell Heflin Democrat of Alabama a former State Supreme Court judge who is a member of the Judiciary Committee Gravity of Choice to Reagan White House officials were reluctant to discuss the strategy being used to find a replacement but emphasized the importance of the decision In a statement praising Justice Powell the President said that nominating a successor was one of the most significant duties of my office One top Reagan supporter who has played a major role in the Presidents last two Court appointments of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Judge Antonin Scalia said the particular issue of abortion had not been central to those selections He said the main consideration had been larger factors such as whether the candidate was a strict constructionist one who had practiced judicial restraint In this instance however he said the White House was aware that the nominee could have potential impact on the Court rulings on abortion Justice Powell has voted with the fivemember Court majority permitting legalized abortion The first hint of Justice Powells resignation plans reached the White House Thursday evening when a secretary for Chief Justice Rehnquist called Mr Bakers office and inquired where the chief of staff could be found between 915 and 945 Friday morning one aide said today Mr Bakers office said he would be meeting in the Oval Office with the President and that is where he took the call and was told of Mr Powells plans today Mr Baker then informed the President who was described by the chief of staff as mildly surprised Team Involved in Search The search for a successor is being conducted by A B Culvahouse Jr the White House counselor He is to meet with Mr Baker on Monday to pare the list One aim of White House officials another aide said is to speed the process of choosing a replacement and to keep the selection in the hands of the White House One concern is that a delay could fuel interference either from elsewhere in the Administration or from conservative groups seeking to influence Mr Reagans choice one aide said We would like to have a choice by next week the official said While White House officials said today that the selection process would be under the direction of Mr Baker Justice Department officials asserted that the major role would belong to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d Meese will be very influential as the Attorney General and a friend of the President said the aide who had been involved in the selection process Timing May Be Beneficial One view within the White House is that the Presidents selection of a nominee who might have difficulty being confirmed could result in prolonged Congressional hearings that might stretch into next year That prospect is increasing the likelihood that Mr Reagan will choose a sitting Federal judge who has already won confirmation or a candidate who is perceived as an easy possibility aides said The one thing they dont want is to put forth a candidate who will keep the pot boiling without being confirmed said one such Reagan associate Senator Patrick Leahy a Vermont Democrat who is a member of the Judiciary Committee said the timing of Justice Powells announcement could give Mr Reagan more latitude than he might have had in the final year of his term If this was next year the President would have to sit down and work with the Senate in picking somebody whose qualifications were predominantly competence not ideology Mr Leahy said But with a year and a half to go if he wants to expend an enormous amount of political capital he can pick somebody whose qualifications are ideological rather than competence and probably get him confirmed Senator Helflin said he did not think Mr Reagan would have trouble winning approval of his nominee Mr Baker insisted in an interview with reporters today that he was not a candidate saying no when asked if he wanted to become a Supreme Court Justice I took this job at the Presidents request and I intend to return to private life the chief of staff said
"Justice Powell, Model Conservative",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/opinion/justice-powell-model-conservative.html,When President Nixon named Lewis Powell to the Supreme Court 15 years ago he was determined to reverse the previous 15 years of Warren Court liberal activism Four Nixon appointments did not a counterrevolution make thanks in part to Justice Powells balance and moderation Quiet courtly but with forceful intellect Justice Powell has helped move the Court in a responsibly conservative direction To his credit he was unwilling to ride roughshod over precedents just because he disagreed with them If that is judicial restraint may his retirement announced yesterday lead to more of the same President Reagan and his supporters have even more than Richard Nixon lusted to capture the Federal judiciary for their philosophy That may be tempered by the Democratic control of the Senate and its Judiciary Committee which must pass on nominees Thats fortunate for moderation because the ideologues main targets are the very social agenda issues on which Justice Powell took firm progressive positions He drew sharp lines against Government aid to parochial schools thus confounding true believers He wrote eloquently on the need for cautious affirmative action to integrate student bodies and the work force and to give them more variety He supported a womans right to choose abortion and with characteristic symmetry delivered the Courts opinion denying the right to have the state pay for it Justice Powell rarely voted to expand defendants rights in criminal cases but he joined a consensus holding to the basic Miranda rule that arrested persons must be warned of what rights they have Lewis Powell was a highly successful Virginia lawyer who rose to the presidency of the American Bar Association He led the bar to sponsor vital legal services for the poor President Nixon had to twist his arm to accept the Supreme Court nomination in 1971 after other candidates had met with stiff bar opposition Then 64 Justice Powell originally planned to serve only 10 years Now at 79 he has richly earned his retirement Justice Powells service challenges President Reagan to name a qualified balanced collegial successor Thats reason to hope that Orrin Hatch the combative Senator from Utah was right yesterday to predict that he will not be chosen His nomination could sharply divide the Senate and the country by testing a constitutional hurdle to appointment the provision that no legislator can be named to an office whose pay was increased during his term Congress recently raised judicial pay Beyond that anomaly there must be available conservative lawyers who are better qualified by temperament Lewis Powell is an admirable model
POWELL: MODERATION AMID DIVISIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/us/powell-moderation-amid-divisions.html,For a decade and a half Lewis F Powell Jr sat at the center of an often polarized Supreme Court While any vacancy on the Court carries the potential for significant change Justice Powells retirement on the eve of his 80th birthday creates a particular void in tone as well as substance Justice Powell was the Courts balancer and compromiser a thoughtful judge whose vote could rarely be taken for granted but who was widely regarded as open to the persuasive power of any lawyers best argument His vote was crucial in key areas On affirmative action he often joined narrow majorities that thwarted the Reagan Administrations opposition to most raceconscious remedies to discrimination On religion his opinions drew fine lines between church and state On abortion he remained committed with a shrinking majority to the 1973 precedent that established it as a constitutional right Tone of Moderation Asked at a news conference today to name his most important opinion Justice Powell replied that it was probably the Allan P Bakke case the 1978 ruling that invalidated a racial quota for medical school admissions but kept the door open for affirmative action With the Court otherwise deadlocked 4 to 4 he wrote the key opinion that defused at least for a time an explosive issue Although that performance was typical Justice Powells legacy lies not so much in any one opinion as in his overall approach a search for consensus among deep divisions a tone of moderation in a period when discourse both within the Court and around it was sometimes shrill His departure comes at a critical moment for each of three major institutions of Government for the Court itself one year into the stewardship of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist for a politically troubled Presidency determined to make judicial conservatism its lasting legacy and for the Senate where a tenuous Democratic majority lacks a consensus on the role of ideology in judicial confirmations Justice Powells own judicial career exemplified the vagaries of Supreme Court nominations Selected by President Nixon as part of his effort to reverse the liberal legacy of the Warren Court Justice Powell a corporate lawyer and leader of the Virginia establishment soon made it clear that he fit into no neat category A Sparing Use of Power He is a political moderate with an aversion to heated rhetoric and ideological rigidity As a Justice his principal guidepost appeared to be a deep respect for the Supreme Court as an institution which carried with it both a commitment to guard the Courts independence and a determination to use its power sparingly He never confirmed this publicly but seemed at times to be troubled and even offended by some of the Reagan Administrations aggressive efforts to use the Court to advance its political agenda on abortion civil rights aid to parochial schools and other matters At the height of that period in mid1983 he wrote an opinion for a 6to3 majority that affirmed the Courts continued support of its landmark abortion ruling Roe v Wade which the Administration had asked the Court to overturn His tone was acerbic The doctrine of judicial adherence to precedent he wrote is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law He added We respect it today and reaffirm Roe v Wade Usurping Legislative Roles Justice Powells belief that the Court should take a limited view of its powers sprang from two sources his respect for the role of the states within the Federal system and his conviction that policy choices should be made by the peoples elected representatives rather than by Federal judges tenured for life A concurring opinion in a 1974 case US v Richardson expressed his sense of judicial restraint as clearly as anything else he wrote The Court held that a taxpayer could not bring a suit challenging the way the Central Intelligence Agency was financed He wrote We should be ever mindful of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of government by a nonrepresentative and in large measure insulated judicial branch He dissented on similar grounds from the Courts 1972 landmark ruling Furman v Georgia which invalidated the death penalty as it then existed He said the Court was usurping the role of Congress and the state legislatures Justice Powell also saw the Court as an occasional counterweight to excess or shortsightedness in the other branches of Government Two years ago he provided the fifth vote to strike down a Federal program that paid for remedial instruction in parochial schools There remains a considerable risk of continuing political strife over the propriety of direct aid to religious schools and the proper allocation of limited governmental resources he wrote in his concurring opinion in Aguilar v Felton Justice Powell provided the key vote in a long series of cases that set limits on Federal aid to parochial schools and in the process defined the constitutional boundaries between church and state He drew fine distinctions approving some programs and invalidating others Sensitivity to Education He was the one who continued to take thin slices of the salami Jesse Choper dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley and a specialist in this area said in an interview today The eight others knew exactly where they were I always had a picture in my mind of everyone else looking to Powell and asking Well are we alright Justice Powell brought a special sensitivity to cases involving public education the result of long service on local and state school boards He was head of the Richmond Va School Board from 1952 to 1961 a period of resistance to the Supreme Courts 1954 school desegregation decision Under his leadership the Richmond schools were integrated peacefully After his Supreme Court nomination a group of liberal Democratic senators issued a statement praising him as one of the courageous men in Virginia during that troubled time A trial lawyer who graduated from Washington and Lee University and Harvard Law School he was active in the organized bar As president of the American Bar Association in 1964 and 1965 he lobbied vigorously for an increased Federal role in providing legal services to the poor From 1938 until he took his seat on the Supreme Court he was a partner in the Richmond law firm now known as Hunton  Williams He and his wife Josephine whom he married in 1936 never cut their ties to Richmond where Justice Powell said today that he hoped to spend more time In his gentle way Justice Powell sometimes told people he resented his frequent characterization as a swing vote on the Court he believed the phrase denoted someone who wanted to see which way the wind was blowing before making up his mind In an interview with Bill Moyers broadcast on public television Thursday night Justice Powell was asked how he expected to be remembered I couldnt possibly speculate on that he replied Very few Supreme Court Justices ever become household names he noted adding I think certainly in the long reach of history I may be a footnote somewhere but thats the most I would expect
POWELL LEAVES HIGH COURT; TOOK KEY ROLE ON ABORTION AND ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/us/powell-leaves-high-court-took-key-role-on-abortion-and-on-affirmative-action.html,Justice Lewis F Powell Jr the determined moderate who has provided the critical fifth votes in key Supreme Court rulings for abortion rights and affirmative action in recent years retired today for reasons of age and health His resignation gave President Reagan a historic opportunity to shape the future of the court Justice Powells surprise announcement set the stage for what is likely to be a politically charged Senate confirmation battle if Mr Reagan nominates as a successor a candidate who shares his own conservative views on social issues Such a choice could tip the Courts ideological balance decisively to the right on several key issues most conspicuously on abortion because it could produce a majority for President Reagans view that the Constitution does not protect abortion rights Health Problems Cited The President today praised Justice Powells intellectual balance and fairmindedness and said he would move quickly to nominate a successor The 79yearold Justice a former American Bar Association president cited his advancing age and a concern that I could handicap the Court in the event of reoccurrences of serious health problems He added I leave the Court with a great deal of sadness Three of the Courts other four supporters of broad abortion rights are also 78 or older But none have suggested they are ready to retire An Emphatic No Justice William J Brennan Jr who is 81 and Thurgood Marshall who will be 79 on July 2 have said emphatically that they are not Justice Harry A Blackmun is 78 Justice Powell has also been a key vote for the liberal majority in many 5to4 decisions on civil rights civil liberties issues and separation of church and state He has voted with the Courts conservatives as often as with its liberals however and has helped steer the Court to the right on criminal law and the death penalty while holding a moderatetoliberal course on civil rights and civil liberties He has forcefully rejected Reagan Administration positions in a number of cases at the heart of its ideological agenda The possible effect of a conservative successor to Justice Powell was a repeated theme of reactions from interest groups and members of Congress today with liberal groups expressing the fear and conservatives the hope that Mr Reagan would choose a strong ideological conservative Liberals began mobilizing to fight any such nominee within moments of the surprise announcement this morning by Chief Justice William H Rehnquist from the Supreme Court bench A True Conservative Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights the major lobbying coalition of civil rights organizations said today Lewis Powell has been a fair and distinguished Justice He has been a true conservative not a rightwing zealot As a centrist on the Court he has helped reaffirm our basic civil rights laws and remedies He added The Senate must exercise with extreme care its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent and there should be no rush to judgment Last summer the Leadership Conference passionately opposed the nomination of Chief Justice Rehnquist and is sure to do the same with better hopes of success in a Senate now controlled by Democrats if Mr Reagan chooses another likeminded conservative Senate Democrats indicated today that they would resist any effort to add such a voice to the Court when Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware chairman of the Judiciary Committee said that the committee would insist that the existing ideological balance of the Court be preserved The announcement that Justice Powell had stepped down was made as the Court ended its term stunning those in the courtroom We wish to take note with great regret the retirement of Justice Lewis F Powell as a member of this Court Justice Rehnquist said Fourth Appointment for Reagan The possibility of a change in the Courts moderate course is far stronger now than when Chief Justice Warren E Burger retired last June and President Reagan chose Justice Rehnquist to succeed him as Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia to fill the resulting vacancy On that occasion the practical effect was to replace one conservative vote with another with little difference expected in the outcome of cases President Reagan also appointed Justice Sandra Day OConnor the Courts first woman in 1981 Among Presidents since Dwight D Eisenhower only President Nixon had more appointments than Mr Reagan Mr Nixon had four Justice Powell is widely regarded as the epitome of a Virginia gentleman and a model of decency and fairness who recoiled from strong ideological arguments from both left and right Family Aided Decision He said in a prepared statement that he had made his decision to retire this week after detailed consultations with his family and one close friend and had told nobody else but the Chief Justice about it until this morning He declined to identify the friend He said of the Court My respect for it as a unique institution has been enhanced by the privilege of serving here I will miss being an active Justice more than I can say He added at a news conference that consideration of how his departure might affect the Courts balance had played no part in his thinking and had not influenced his timing The decision was made by my family and me he said as his wife the former Josephine Pierce Rucker looked on I spent a fair amount of time on the telephone with all four of our children and of course with my wife He noted that he will be 80 years old on Sept 19 and said that while he is presently in good health prostate cancer surgery in 1985 caused him to miss two months of Court proceedings But he added As the record makes clear I carried my full load on the Court during the term now ending working long hours including Saturdays and a large part of Sundays Hopes to Resume His Tennis He said he will spend more time at his home in Richmond and with his family but will maintain an office at the Court He said he will consider occasionally sitting as a Federal court of appeals judge and may teach a seminar at a law school Id like to start playing tennis again which I havent done for some years he added He also disclosed that he had seriously considered retiring in 1982 as he had suggested he would when Mr Nixon appointed him 10 years earlier But he said All four of my children really became quite indignant that I even considered retiring after 10 years and talked him out of it After much agonizing with his family this month he said with a smile his son Lewis a Richmond lawyer said Dad its a whole lot better to go out when some people might be sorry than it is to wait until when you decide to go ahead people say Thank God we got rid of that old gent  Activists on Abortion React The reaction to his retirement was especially strong among groups that passionately oppose and support abortion rights Justice Powell was the pivotal vote on the Court said Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action league I think the right of safe and legal abortion has never been in more serious jeopardy since Roe v Wade the 1973 decision declaring abortion a constitutional right Senator Gordon J Humphrey a conservative New Hampshire Republican said We seem to be only one vote away from ending the dark night of the abortion holocaust All prolife forces are now looking to President Reagan Such comments on the pivotal role of Justice Powell and the strategic position his successor will occupy on many politically charged issues came from dozens of groups and political figures across the ideological spectrum Faulted by Administration Administration officials have long viewed Justice Powell as hostile to some of their causes and have privately criticized him for philosophical inconsistency and for departing from their vision of judicial restraint His votes against the Administrations position were decisive for example in two major 5to4 decisions upholding job preferences for minority group members this year and last in a 5to4 decision last year striking down a Pennsylvania law that restricted abortion rights and in a key 5to4 decision in 1985 striking down two Government programs aiding religious schools One example of his importance is that he voted with the majority in 34 of the 43 cases the Court decided by 5to4 margins in the term that ended today far more than any other Justice The general rule is that if Justice Powell is on our side we win Mr Neas the civil rights lobbyist said in a recent interview If he is on the other side we lose The regrets expressed by liberals today were so strong not because Justice Powell always sided with them but because they fear his successor will always side against them Liberals were greatly distressed earlier this year when Justice Powell wrote a 5to4 decision upholding Georgias death sentencing system despite strong statistical evidence that killers of whites are far more likely to be condemend than killers of blacks They were similarly distressed a year ago when he cast the fifth vote for upholding a Georgia sodomy law But characteristically he said in a separate opinion that if a case were to come along in which a prison term had been imposed for sodomy he might well rule it to be cruel and unusual punishment
Powell's Pivotal Votes Marked '87 Court Term,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/us/powell-s-pivotal-votes-marked-87-court-term.html,The first term of the Rehnquist Court which ended Friday could more aptly be called the last term of the Powell Court While Chief Justice William H Rehnquist presided it was Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who more than anyone cast the decisive votes But with the unexpected retirement of Justice Powell on Friday the Supreme Court in its next term may become the Reagan Court The President now has a chance not just to fill a third vacancy but to put conservatives firmly in control with a chance to act on such issues as abortion affirmative action and religion The decisions of the 198687 term showed little deviation from the Courts direction in Warren E Burgers 17 years as Chief Justice The rulings were moderate to liberal on social issues like racial and sexual discrimination abortion and churchstate relations more conservative on criminal law and civil liberties and moderate and pragmatic in its basic instincts Last year when President Reagan picked Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger and Antonin Scalia another strong ideological conservative to take the Rehnquist seat  many conservatives had hoped  and liberals had feared  that the Court would move perceptibly to the right But the Court did not move and Chief Justice Rehnquist found himself in dissent as often as he had in the past joined by the independentminded Justice Scalia slightly less often than he had been by Mr Burger Strategic Place at the Center Now however the Court has reached the tipping point because the liberal victories in so many ideologically charged cases have been by onevote margins with Justice Powell in the majority As in the past he was more often in the majority than any other member of the Court especially in the major cases and the 5to4 decisions His vote in those cases determined whether the conservative Chief Justice or the liberal wing symbolized by Justice William J Brennan Jr would win Justice Powells strategic place at the dead center of the Courts sharp ideological divide and his moderate casebycase approach to issues made him the most appropriate symbol of the approach to the law taken by the Burger Court The Split Decisions Among the 5to4 decisions on which Justice Powell had a decisive impact were these cases  A decision in February upholding a Federal district courts order requiring that Alabama temporarily use a strict racial quota one black for one white in promoting state troopers to make up for severe past discrimination against blacks  A decision this week that a clerical employee in a county constables office had a First Amendment right not to be dismissed for saying she hoped President Reagan would be assassinated  A decision last week that emotionally charged evidence about the impact of a murder on a victims family cannot be presented at a death sentencing hearing because it might inflame the jury against the defendant In other cases Justice Powell voted with the majority this term in major liberal victories on issues including teaching the theory of creation versus evolution in public schools pregnancy leave affirmative action preferences for women and minorities and discrimination against people with infectious diseases like AIDS Justice Powell also cast the crucial fifth vote to strike down a Pennsylvania law restricting abortion rights and to uphold the Federal courts authority to order racial preferences in hiring in order to remedy egregious past discrimination Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented in all of these cases and the Reagan Administration through legal briefs filed with the Court was on the losing side in all but the death penalty case in which it was not a party But Justice Powell did not always side with the Courts liberals In fact in 71 percent of the 87 cases on which Justice Brennan and Chief Justice Rehnquist disagreed Justice Powell joined the Chief Justice These included the vast majority of the criminal cases and some of the major decisions of the term The Reagan Agenda Among those were 5to4 decisions upholding Georgias death penalty sentencing system despite statistical evidence of racial discrimination allowing the use of the death penalty against murder accomplices who neither killed nor intended to kill and sharply limiting the powers of landuse regulators to appropriate private property for public use without compensation He also was in the majority in the landmark 6to3 decision upholding detention without bail of purportedly dangerous defendants But on the issues at the heart of the Reagan ideological agenda  abortion affirmative action and churchstate relations  Justice Powell stood solidly with the liberals in defending Supreme Court precedents against attacks by conservatives One paradoxical effect of the elevation of Justice Rehnquist to Chief Justice was that in several cases the liberals probably won more sweeping victories than they would have under the somewhat less consistently conservative Chief Justice Burger This was because Mr Burger was said to vote sometimes with the majority in cases in which he really agreed with the dissenters in order to preserve his power of assigning the majority opinion to himself or to someone else who would frame it narrowly When the Chief Justice is in dissent the senior member of the majority assigns the opinion Chief Justice Rehnquist on the other hand has not compromised his conservative principles in such a way As a result Justice Brennan the Courts senior and most liberal member has been able to assign more opinions He has used this to good advantage assigning the two affirmative action cases and several other major rulings to himself and writing them in broad liberal strokes Following are summaries of some of the major rulings of the term that began last Oct 6 DISCRIMINATION In its broadest endorsement yet of affirmative action the Court ruled that employers may sometimes favor women and minorities over betterqualified men and whites in hiring and promoting to counteract statistical imbalances in their workforces The decision rejecting a mans assertion that he had been a victim of illegal sex discrimination was the first involving an affirmative action plan giving women preferences over men It was also the Courts first unambiguous holding that no proof of past discrimination by an employer against women or minorities was needed to justifify a voluntary affirmative action plan that discriminates in their favor as long as it was narrowly tailored to correct statistical underrepresentation of those groups and as long as the adverse impact on white men was limited The vote to uphold the plan was 6 to 3 but Justice Sandra Day OConnor did not join in Justice Brennans majority opinion which she said endorsed affirmative action too broadly Justice Powells was therefore the crucial fifth vote for the Brennan approach Johnson v Transportation Agency No 851129 Together with the Alabama state trooper case and three decisions last year two of which were decided by 5to4 margins the Johnson decision completely shredded the Administrations broad legal attack on affirmative action Justice Powell was in the majority in all five cases In a case of major importance to working women and employers the Court ruled 6 to 3 that states may require employers to grant special job preferences to employees who are physically unable to work because of pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions Upholding a California law that requires employers to provide up to four months unpaid leave the Court rejected arguments by the Administration and others that the law was preempted by a Federal law against pregnancy discrimination because it required benefits for pregnant employees that it did not require for others California Federal Savings and Loan v Guerra No 85494 In a 72 decision that could benefit many victims of AIDS the Court ruled that recipients of Federal money may not discriminate against people who are physically or mentally impaired by tuberculosis and other infectious diseases unless they posed a real threat of infection to others or could not do their work School Board v Arline No 851277 The Court ruled unanimously that Arabs Jews Hispanic Americans and members of other ethnic groups may sue under a postCivil War law that prohibited racial discrimination in employment housing and other contract and property rights St Francis College v AlKhazraji No 852169 Shaare Tefila Congregation v Cobb No 2156 Casting doubt on assertions by many private clubs that they had a constitutional right to exclude women from membership the Court ruled 7 to 0 that states could outlaw such discrimination by Rotary Clubs Board of Directors of Rotary International v Rotary Club of Duarte No 86421 CRIMINAL LAW In the Georgia death penalty decision the Court ended the last sweeping unresolved challenge to capital punishment which could have invalidated the sentences of hundreds of the nearly 2000 death row inmates at a stroke The case involved strong statistical evidence that killers of whites especially black killers were far more likely to be condemned to death than killers of blacks But Justice Powells majority opinion held that the statistics did not prove unconstitutional racial discrimination against any individual defendant McCleskey v Kemp No 846811 In another 5to4 decision the Court held that the death penalty could sometimes be used against accomplices in crimes leading to death even if they did not personally kill or intend to kill Tison v Arizona No 846075 The case cut back sharply on a 1982 precedent and could lead to much wider use of the death penalty The biggest consolation for opponents of capital punishment was the 5to4 decision barring the use in sentencing hearings of evidence regarding the impact of the murder on the victims family Booth v Maryland No 865020 The landmark ruling that Federal courts may jail criminal defendants before trial if they are deemed threats to public safety upheld a provision of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and alarmed civil libertarians It was the Courts first broad endorsement of the constitutionality of preventive detention United States v Salerno No 8687 Overruling a major 1969 Supreme Court decision the Justices broadened the jurisdiction of military courtsmartial by holding that military personnel may be courtmartialed even for crimes unrelated to their service Solorio v United States No 851581 Defendants charged with betraying a public trust fared better in the Court than those charged with violent crimes They succeeded in blunting the most potent weapon used by Federal prosecutors against political corruption at the state and local level unions corruption and business fraud Rejecting the unanimous view of lower Federal courts the Court ruled that those who defraud their victims of intangible rights such as the right to have public officials perform their duties honestly could not be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute and similar laws McNally v United States No 86234 In several narrower decisions the Court continued its recent course of making it easier for the police to interrogate criminal defendants by limiting the scope of the 1966 Miranda decision which required that arrested suspects be told of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during questioning Several other decisions continued the a similar trend of making it easier for the police to search for evidence of crime The Justices relaxed some of the complex rules under which lower courts had suppressed evidence on the ground that it was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment And they broadened the immunity of officials from damage suits for illegal searches and seizures that they could reasonably have believed to be lawful RELIGION In a major blow to efforts by fundamentalist Christian groups to mold school curriculums the Court ruled 7 to 2 that states may not require that the creationist theory of mans origins be given equal time in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution It struck down as an establishment of religion a 1981 Lousiana law requiring balanced treatment for creationscience in any school that taught evolution saying the laws purpose was to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind Edwards v Aguillard No 851513 The Court unanimously upheld an act of Congress allowing nonprofit religious organizations to discriminate on religious grounds in hiring even for secular jobs The law allows hospitals nursing homes health clubs and other secular institutions run by religious groups to discriminate on religious grounds despite the 1964 Civil Rights Acts general ban against such discrimination in employment Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v Amos Nos 86179 and 86401 Citing the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion the Court ruled 8 to 1 in a Florida case that states may not deny unemployment benefits to employees who are dismissed for refusing to work on their Sabbath Hobbie v Unemployment Appeals Commission No 85993 ELECTIONS Striking down a Connecticut law the Court cleared the way for independent voters to take part in a political partys primary elections if the party wants them to do so The law limited voting in primaries to people previously enrolled in a party The Court held 5 to 4 that it violated the State Republican Partys First Amendment right to freedom of association Since 1984 the party had sought to open its primaries to independents Tashjian v Republican Party No 85766 In another 5to4 election case the Court ruled that a Congressional ban on direct corporate spending in political campaigns was unconstitutional as it was applied to a Massachusetts antiabortion group and other small nonprofit advocacy groups Federal Eelection Commission v Massachusetts Citizens for Life No 85701 FREE SPEECH The decision in favor of the woman who had said she hoped President Reagan would be assassinated expanded somewhat the free speech rights of government employees It was based on the Courts holding that the remark which came in the context of her criticism of Mr Reagans cuts in welfare programs that benefit blacks was protected political speech Rankin v McPherson No 852068 The Court upheld 5 to 3 a Federal law classifying as political proaganda all foreign government films that might influence public opinion on United States foreign policies It said the laws terminology did not unconstitutionally inhibit free speech by persons wanting to show the film Meese v Keene No 851180 PROPERTY RIGHTS The Court handed property owners two major victories against landuse regulators at the local state and Federal levels in decisions that are certain to spur many lawsuits by owners complaining of overly burdensome regulation It ruled 6 to 3 that owners have a constitutional right to compensation from governments for regulations that deprive them even temporarily of all use of their land and are not limited to seeking court orders invalidating the regulations First English Evangenical Lutheran Church v County of Los Angeles No 851199 On Friday in a 5to4 decision involving Californias regulation of beachfront properties the Court restricted the power of governments to require people who seek permission to build on their own land to surrender part of their ownership rights for public use without compensation The Court said governments must pay compensation unless the concessions they impose on the property owners are reasonably necessary to offset burdens the new construction would place on the public Nollan v California Coastal Commission No 86133 SECURITIES LAW In an important victory for companies seeking protection from hostile corporate takeovers the Court on a 6to3 vote upheld for the first time a state law restricting hostile offers for companies incorporated there The Indiana law could condition the voting rights of those making tender offers or otherwise increasing their holdings above certain levels on the approval of all other shareholders CTS Corp v Dynamics Corp Nos 8671 and 8697 In a victory for the securities industry the Court ruled 5 to 4 that firms may block customers from bringing fraud suits in Federal courts by using standard agreements that relegate all such disputes to arbitration ShearsonAmerican Express v McMahon No 8644 POLITICAL ASYLUM The Court voted 6 to 3 to require the Government to relax its standard for deciding whether aliens who contend they would be persecuted in their home countries are eligible for political asylum rejecting the Administrations position that they must prove a clear probability that they would be persecuted Immigration and Naturalization Service v CardozaFonseca No 85782
IS JACK KEMP MR. RIGHT?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/magazine/is-jack-kemp-mr-right.html,PEANUT BUTTER JACK Kemp asked accusingly holding up his halfeaten chocolate chip cookie His wife met his eye Yes Joanne Kemp confessed she had mixed some peanut butter into the cookie batter Kemp shook his head and went off to take a call from an aide to discuss Bretton Woods and other fine points of monetary policy On matters such as cookies the nineterm Congressman from the Buffalo suburbs can get tough Theres a real impulsiveness to him on the little things says his 27yearold son Jeff a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks He wants his cheeseburger cooked the right way and served when he wants it and he gets upset if theres a traffic tieup on the freeway But on the big issues in life hes willing to wait 25 years to prove a point It happened with football he was sitting on the bench for years telling the skeptics hed make it And it happened with supplyside economics Now it is happening with his bid to be President Once again Jack French Kemp is predicting that given time he will surprise those who compare his campaign to a damp match The thing youve got to understand he says leaning in and looking you in the eye is that I really believe this stuff The former quarterback for the championship Buffalo Bills has long been heralded as the glamour boy of the conservative set the Son of Gipper and Ronald Reagans natural heir Neoconservatives such as Irving Kristol support him and so do Representatives Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Vin Weber of Minnesota among others Yet Kemp has found the mantle strangely elusive The absence of fire in his campaign and his inability to dominate the field and keep out other conservatives such as Pat Robertson and Paul Laxalt has mystified Washington Lately it has also severely hampered his ability to raise money But because of George Bushs connection to an Administration under Congressional investigation and Robert Doles difficulties getting his campaign organized Kemps supporters believe his time will come Despite pressure from the right to rattle more sabers the 51yearold candidate thinks the public will respond to his sunny dream of an economic daisy chain of growth and equality and peace Kemp is going to do a lot better than a lot of people think says William Schneider a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute This is the same sort of thing they said about Gary Hart in 1983 misconstruing a lack of name recognition as no support If he does not seem discouraged it may be because Kemp knows something that those who would write him off do not he is not programmed for failure In a season in which some candidates have shown a flair for selfdestruction Kemp is engaged in a continuing and obsessive process of selfimprovement I know I know he moans to a reporter visiting his suburban Maryland home as his wife serves his favorite Sunday lunch of grilled kielbasa Frenchs mustard Cherry Coke and cookies Im not supposed to talk so much about taxes SOME OF WASHINGTONS SAVVIEST political operatives  Edward Rollins Charles Black Jeffrey Bell Roger Stone and John Buckley  are providing Kemp with the sort of training that Jack Burden gave to Willie Stark in All the Kings Men You tell em too much the fictional reporter told Stark the longshot candidate for governor Hell make em cry make em laugh make em mad at you stir them up and theyll love it and come back for more But for heavens sake dont try and improve their minds His advisers have made the hyperkinetic and longwinded Kemp sit still for a speech coach He and Joanne have studied tapes of his old speeches and he is working to hone his message from 15 or 20 points to three or four His staff even gave him a digital stopwatch to remind him to keep it short When he lost it they gave him another Kemp has also been struggling to get some fresher issues and exorcise Professor Kemp as his staffers jokingly call the side of him that likes to give esoteric economic lectures on such topics as illiquidity It bugs everyone who loves and admires Jack says Richard Viguerie the conservative activist and Kemp supporter Wed like to perform a frontal lobotomy so that he never talks about monetary reform again Kemp tries but once he has an audience in hand he often succumbs to temptation It is like watching a sky diver with a heady feeling of exhilaration at first as Kemps energy and optimism shoot through the room Then midair the parachute doesnt open and the audience gets lost in the thicket of Kempisms The real problem is deflation he told a group in Iowa That is the opposite of inflation but equally serious to the borrower The reaction is often like that of the Iowa farmer who told his friend He was real good but I dont know about all that economic bull IT SEEMS  REMEMBERING the waves of ReaganKemp signs at the Republican convention in 1980 and Kemp in 88 signs in 1984  that he has been running forever Those aging teenidol looks and brown helmet of hair the gold collar pin and JFKembroidered shirts the walnutsized American Football League championship diamond ring and the Florsheim loafers he kicks off at every chance  all became familiar as Kemp crisscrossed the country on behalf of supplyside economics and other Republican candidates The hottest young property in his party he was wryly dubbed Boy WunderKemp by The Buffalo News political cartoonist and helped inspire the seriously coiffed cartoon character of Bob Forehead the Congressman who once wanted to be a gameshow host in Washingtoon Kemp got credit for helping to shape the Reagan agenda and serving as its architect in Congress with the KempRoth taxcutting legislation He has found other issues on which to crusade but his House colleagues still call him Jackie One Note  joking that if you ask him how to solve the problem of teenage pregnancy hell tell you to cut taxes When the Iran scandal broke Kemp felt constrained about criticizing Mr Reagan and it was Dole the Senate minority leader who deftly used the limelight to coopt his spot as the future Presidential alternative to George Bush It was galling but Kemp recast himself as the underdog Instead of the soaring expectations of years past the plan for the 1988 primaries is to aim lower  coming in a strong third in Iowa and first or second in New Hampshire If no other candidate has developed frontrunner momentum Kemp hopes to emerge as the alternative going into the Minnesota caucus  where he has a chance of winning a plurality of the states delegates  and Super Tuesday in early March in the South where he appears to be running second to Bush but has pockets of support in Georgia and a handful of other states Dole who privately regards Kemp as a pretty boy who devalues ideas jokes that he should aim for football commissioner But while Dole has been struggling to get his campaign organized in New Hampshire Kemp has an impressive grassroots operation with a chairman in every town He has gathered endorsements from five of the 10 Republican County chairmen 43 of the 282 Republicans in the State Legislature and leaders in key antitax antigun control and antiabortion movements The campaign collected more than 2 million in small donations but edged into the red this spring and resorted to a risky strategy of borrowing against Federal matching funds it anticipates receiving next year Kemp is now spending more time on major fundraising events with the help of some big businessmen  including Paul Oreffice chairman of the board of Dow Chemical Saul Steinberg chairman of Wall Streets Reliance Group Holdings and Roger Enrico the president of PepsiCola Kemp knows he is running from a very narrow base He does not have close ties to the Republican establishment in New York and nine of his 13 Republican colleagues in the state delegation have endorsed Bush His national following is eclectic  his steering committee boasts fellowquarterback Joe Namath and the scientist Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen bomb He draws support from the supplyside movement and economists such as George Gilder and Robert Mundell from neoconservatives such as Kristol members of the old right like Congressman Henry Hyde and the Conservative Opportunity Society in the House including Gingrich Weber and Mississippian Trent Lott I dont think people understand how serious Jack is and how knowledgeable says Jeane Kirkpatrick a Kemp admirer He doesnt live his life to try to please some imaginary other or to build some public image but to express himself He goes beyond ideological stereotypes IF DOLE IS SELLING competence and Bush is selling location as they say in real estate then Kemp is selling vision What Kemp has that the others dont is an overarching philosophy he believes in something a quality he shares with Ronald Reagan and Jack Kennedy said Burton Y Pines a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation He has a good conservative philosophy about the individuals place in society and governments role in relation to the individual and Americas place in the world And he knows where they all fit Kemps speech is sprinkled with bright childlike words  wow super and neat  and he often seems as one friend puts it like an overgrown kid His philosophy may seem tired to some Republicans but Kemp always acts as though it is a shiny red toy he wants to shake in front of your face until you realize how really neat it is I unabashedly unashamedly unequivocally support the explosion of entrepreneurs in the capitalist system he says Theres no limit to what free men and free women in a free market with free enterprise can accomplish when people are free to follow their dream Kemp began reading voraciously while he was playing pro football  economics philosophy history biography  and has never stopped Some people have theorized that I lurched to prove myself intellectually he says But it was not any lurch It was more a kind of awakening While his zest for ideas is appealing it often creates the impression that he is trying too hard With his body language and the weighty issues he chooses he always seems to be grabbing your elbow and saying I am an intellectual damn it  said Norman Ornstein a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute For all that he is an extremely smart and very deep man he doesnt think so And that lack of inner security can ultimately be a serious problem because Ronald Reagan has an inner serenity that people like in a President Kemp relished his role as the Savonarola of supply side because it helped people see him as a thinker rather than a thrower And even though many experts still regard supply side as economic hocuspocus and cite the soaring deficit as proof of its failure Kemp remains a true believer To the dismay of some Republicans he has no plan for the deficit except to try to grow out of it After so long as a monetary missionary he has had a hard time switching to selling himself Politics is so much I I I me me mehe says Its always more fun if you will or easier if you will to push a platform or a policy Considered brash and egotistical when he got to Washington in 1971 Kemp now reflects a curious shyness He bristles with confidence when discussing his ideas but grows reticent when the subject is Kemp the man or Kemp the leader Friends say that he is still a little awestruck at his own trajectory Heres a guy who came out of nowhere and in 1977 was thought of as crazy because he was babbling about supply side said Newt Gingrich And now supply side is written up as a benchmark in economics books When asked what he has to offer that his opponents dont Kemp does not jump at the chance I didnt become a quarterback to stop Daryle Lamonica from being a quarterback he told a New Hampshire editorial board referring to a Buffalo Bills teammate Alexander the Great didnt become a leader to stop other people from being leaders KEMPS UNORTHOdox blend of Buffalo bluecollar populism California conservatism and 18thcentury British laissezfaire economics leaves many audiences bemused In Portsmouth NH people traded confused glances as he spoke about moving America toward liberal democracy small l small d  And in Wilkesboro NC a group of Republican businessmen seemed equally befuddled when Kemp called for democratic capitalism small d  and praised Franklin Roosevelt and labor small l Nevertheless the Wilkesboro audience came away keen on Kemp I sort of wondered what he meant by some things said Herman Province an executive with a building materials firm But he was pure and total American We need some more of that The leaders of the right besides being suspicious of Kemp on issues such as labor and his early support of South African sanctions want someone to speak the language of resentment After four years of Reaganism they are feeling betrayed arguing that true conservatism has not been tried Kemp has tried to court this base by sharpening his opposition to abortion pushing for immediate off the shelf deployment of Strategic Defense Initiative technology and criticizing Secretary of State George P Shultz for being too moderate He is even distancing himself from the President Last December Kemp wrote an article for the OpEd page of the The New York Times entitled Trust the Presidents Foreign Policy Now he is lambasting the Administration for being naive and misguided in its approach to arms control But while there is nothing he likes better than arguing people under the table on issues  Im a provocateur he says Some people find me pugnacious and tenacious and obnoxious  his politics are rooted in a gentle Good Shepherd model I have a theory and I want to test it in the marketplace he says earnestly I believe with all my heart that the purpose of leadership in a political party is not to defeat as much as it is to provide leadership KEMP HAS THE BEST record among the Republican contenders for giving women highpaying staff jobs and corrects people who refer to women as girls A longtime civil rights supporter he cringes at racial slurs Riding in the car one afternoon with his wife he mentioned a politician he had met who had used epithets about blacks and Jews Gosh Kemp said with his small disbelieving gasp If he talked that way in private can you imagine    He is also uncomfortable with bashing foreign trading partners When an Iowa farmer banged the table and demanded that the little Japanese devils not be allowed to bring their tractors in here Kemp argued to deaf ears that it is the responsibility of the United States to improve quality and increase exports The candidate is not a man of nuance  politically or socially His friend and adviser Jude Wanniski recalled visiting Kemp at 10 in the morning at his Kansas City hotel during the 1976 Republican convention As the two chatted Kemp ate a breakfast of bacon eggs toast and coffee When he finished he pushed the plates aside pulled another warming dish toward him and proceeded to eat a cheeseburger french fries and a CocaCola Since he planned to practice a speech during the noon hour he thought he had better have both meals at once When he is asked why everyone in his family Jack Joanne Jeff Jennifer 25 Judith 23 and Jimmy 15  has a J name Kemp explains Well I named Jennifer after Jennifer Jones because she was my favorite actress And once we started with Js the last two kids would have felt like oddballs if wed named them Margaret and Pete He can be gruffly friendly but does not have an easy charm His casual conversation consists of remarks such as How did the Celtics do last night Theres no common touch  his curiosity about people and emotional things is nonexistent said one Republican consultant who has known Kemp for years He doesnt make you comfortable Its like the Peggy Lee song Is that all there is You dont get the sense that theres anything coming back at you IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE when Kemp says he believes with all his heart  with every toenail on his foot and all the enamel on his teeth his daughter Jennifer teases  in the power of bluesky optimism His life has been spent reaching for the moon and the stars and  with an enormous amount of hard work getting them From the time he was small the third of four boys in a tightly knit middleclass family in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles Kemp saw himself as a successful gladiator When he went out to the basketball court his father had built for his four sons Kemp would play every member of the UCLA Bruins every member of the opposing team and the sports announcer He was an intense competitor with a great ability to visualize things said his older brother Tom Any little game he played became a largerthanlife activity Their father when he wasnt working long hours building a motorcycle delivery service into a small trucking firm lived for his sons sporting events giving uncritical and emotional approval Their mother a welleducated social worker who spoke fluent Spanish tried to engage Kemps attention with visits to the Hollywood Bowl and piano lessons But for the first two decades of his life he slept ate and dreamed sports even choosing the forward pass for a school essay on a famous invention A 17thround draft choice from Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1957 Jack Kemp refused to lose heart even after he was cut by three National Football League teams He was a member of the legendary 1958 New York Giants with Charlie Conerly and Frank Gifford but never got in for a single play We all encouraged him to get on with his life but he kept knocking around the NFL said Tom Kemp And each time the team would bring in a new highpriced quarterback and Jack would be dropped before he got his chance His parents drove from California to Alberta to see Jack try out for the Canadian Leagues Calgary Stampeders and ended up driving him home when he didnt make the team Unfazed he began writing letters to dozens of coaches begging for a chance In 1960 he was signed by the Los Angeles  soon to become San Diego  Chargers and was an overnight star in the new American Football League In 1962 he moved his wife and two small children to Buffalo where he led the Bills to two AFL championships Asked how the sudden celebrity changed his brother Tom Kemp laughed It didnt change him at all he said It was exactly what he expected all along Kemp swept Joanne his college sweetheart and his own children along on his Persian carpet of positivism Any time Id say I cant do that if I was falling off my skateboard or something hed say Dont say cant  recalls Jeff Id have scabs on my elbows and hed be grilling it into me making sure I didnt quit He made me keep at it until I got a spiral on my football It was the same with anything my sisters tried  riding a bike piano lessons homework He never crossed the line into pushing us But once we asked for his help he didnt let us get discouraged The kids often found JK grams stuck on their mirrors or pillows in the morning  notes of pride on some effort in school or sports or career or notes of persistence after a setback Jennifer a teacher working in Spain found one waiting when she returned from traveling with her father on his announcement swing Dear Jen read the handwriting It was great to have you and your strong presence for these two weeks of hectic campaigning You mean so much to me and what were doing Im proud of you and hope you like the enclosed articles on teaching Love you Dad The Kemps Jennifer says ripping the cellophane Bob Forehead image are very emotional and very sensitive It has long been Kemps habit when his children left for the evening to send them off with a kiss and a single exhortation Even now when I visit home Dads last words are Jennifer be a leader  his daughter said Thats an understood statement in our family It means dont follow along with the crowd Be who you were meant to be Gingrich observed that Kemp has a silly smalltown oldfashioned caring for his children for his friends for life if you will He reminds me of Theodore Roosevelt the sort of guy who jumps up as soon as its daylight so he can go charging down the road to see the sky and the leaves In a different era you could hear Jack saying Bully  His natural high spirits are enhanced by his religion Dad leans toward the optimistic parts of Christianity said Jeff Kemp the ability to rise above the circumstances of life and the general view of our life as being in Gods hands so youre in your right place whether it seems bad or not Raised a Christian Scientist Kemp now attends Presbyterian church every Sunday He says he has renewed his faith in recent years and considers himself a bornagain Christian The family reads the Bible together and discusses the application of various passages to their lives Joanne Kemp also conducts a Bible study group for Congressional wives every Friday THOSE CLOSE TO HIM SAY Kemp has grown more mature and serene Hes much more at peace with things says Tom Kemp He doesnt even have outbursts on the tennis court any more And although some conservatives have questioned whether Kemp is really sure he wants the top job  citing his hesitancy in the past about running for statewide office and his reluctance to be more critical of opponents  his friends say he has come to terms with the idea Gingrich said that after several years in which Kemp was very very scared at the thought of running he went off and sat and talked to Joanne for a long time and he crossed his own personal Rubicon I have to be totally honest Kemp says I think that the aspect of looking in the mirror and saying Theres only one person on earth who should be President and thats me shows such arrogance I could never make that statement Part of what Kemp had to face was the knowledge that in a year in which personal revelation is being stressed reporters would be quizzing him again about rumors of homosexuality that have dogged him for two decades The whispering began in 1967 after Kemp had worked during the offseason in Sacramento as an assistant to a chief aide to newly elected Gov Ronald Reagan That aide and another top official abruptly resigned to return to private life Drew Pearson alleged in a syndicated column that two homosexuals had been fired from the Reagan staff and that Lyn Nofziger the Governors press secretary had told this to reporters Pearson also referred to reports that the homosexual ring was more widespread and involved an athlete Kemp considered suing but friends talked him out of it He told The New York Times reporter Martin Tolchin in a 1978 article for Esquire magazine that he and his boss had been close friends and invested together in the Lake Tahoe cabin where homosexual parties were alleged to have occurred Kemp said he never stayed there and put money into it only as an investment and a way of pleasing his superior He said he traveled with the man on business but did not think he was a homosexual Kemp says he was tarnished by association and got swept in with a lot of people who got hurt Earlier this month Arthur Van Court the United States Marshal in Sacramento who handled Governor Reagans security and who thoroughly investigated the allegations of homosexual activity within the statehouse spoke out for the first time calling the rumor about Kemp hogwash While he declined to discuss the results or subjects of his probe Van Court told a United Press International reporter Just take my word for it Jacks not involved Kemp says now Im not going to keep addressing it I say put up or shut up AFTER TWO CAREERS IN the public eye Kemp has developed an effective mechanism for tuning out others and retreating into himself He seems truly relaxed only in his Cape Cod Colonial house in Bethesda Md I love this home I love my little oasis and I love your cooking he sings drowning out his wifes complaints that he does not eat enough at political dinners and then comes home at midnight and wants cheeseburgers He sits in his black leather swivel chair in a rumpled den filled with signed footballs gold football plaques football posters tennis trophies family pictures piles of newspapers and books and an 18inchhigh metal statue of Don Quixote Just as in his car he talks on his cellular phone or checks a newspaper as he drives around the house he can usually be found doing several things at once  reading watching a news show or sports event on television and talking tennis with his son Jimmy a quarterback at Churchill High School He has recreated the same sort of intensely middleclass life he had growing up Sports family music barbecues lively dinnertable debates Milk and Coke not alcohol are the beverages of choice Highpowered guests at Kemp dinner parties over the years were sometimes surprised to find the children present It was never an adult world and a kid world it was a Kemp family world said Jeff Kemp Married 28 years the Kemps have a close intricate relationship Kemp is deeply influenced by Joanne 51 and she is involved in the smallest details of the campaign  everything from vetting the prose style in his speeches to discussing the way he should answer reporters questions to keeping the tone highminded Newt Gingrich says Kemp fits snugly into his middleclass skin Jack would think it was very silly to want to be an aristocrat he said Why give up all those fun things you can do on Sunday afternoon with the kids in order to go play polo One beautiful Sunday afternoon recently Kemp seemed very reluctant to give up those things to drive downtown for a debate at the Chamber of Commerce He prowled restlessly through the house and walked through a wooded area to the neighborhood tennis court beyond Finally back home he slipped his jacket on and collected Joanne He kissed Jimmy on the cheek and told him to do some homework Good luck

A JUDICIAL SANCTION FOR DEATH BY ASSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/weekinreview/a-judicial-sanction-for-death-by-assent.html,WHEN the New Jersey Supreme Court made three landmark rulings last week expanding a patients right to die it was helping give guidance to an ad hoc system of negotiated death that has developed in recent years On an average day 5500 Americans die Experts estimate that at least several hundred of these deaths occur after doctors patients and family members agree to withhold lifesustaining treatment and let the inevitable occur Death comes to everyone wrote New Jerseys Justice Marie L Garibaldi however in our society due to great advances in medical knowledge and technology over the last few decades death does not come suddenly or completely unexpectedly to most people Often there is time to plan Questions of fate the justice noted have become questions of choice With medical technology advancing much faster than societys willingness to openly address the righttodie issue patients families and doctors are left to work out their own informal pacts in a kind of secret and wellmeaning conspiracy fraught with finality fear and guilt A vast majority of these arrangements are made quietly For lack of agreement and any legislative guidelines a few cases end up in court where typically lower court judges side with the states interest in preserving life no matter how vacant and higher court judges side with the individuals right to choice and privacy In reaching informal agreements on when to withhold treatment doctors are understandably concerned about malpractice and criminal liability while frightened family members worry not only about the welfare of a seriously ill relative but also about their own potential liability When is it acceptable to let someone die In the three decisions the New Jersey court ruled that the individuals right to refuse treatment must come before the interests of the state The decisions were the first by any state court so firmly establishing the primacy of a patients wishes which have often been overshadowed in the healthcare industrys quiet struggle to decide when to use  and more importantly when not to use  its rapidly growing ability to thwart death With so much medical treatment now supplied by specialists who are usually strangers to their patients it has generally seemed prudent to avoid legal problems by doing everything possible to keep a person alive even when this runs counter to a patients or familys desires Significantly the court last week came down firmly on the side of those who see the individuals right to refuse livesaving measures as an exercise of privacy and they provided immunity from civil and criminal liability for those who help make such decisions in good faith The court also held that medical institutions may not refuse a patients wish to have a feeding tube removed Seeking to further clarify such matters the court appealed for legislation a step that concerns some righttodie advocates who fear that a political tugofwar might lead to more confining boundaries than those imposed by the ad hoc approach Legally of course last weeks rulings apply only to New Jersey which has become a leader in the righttodie movement since the same court ruled in a wellpublicized case 11 years ago that a respirator could be removed from a comatose patient Karen Ann Quinlan But the New Jersey decisions will have broad national impact as doctors lawyers judges and bewildered families seek guidance and precedent At the same time the decisions were seen as an ominous setback by organizations such as the New Jersey Right to Life Committee whose members fear that righttodie rulings will undermine the sanctity of life and lead to widespread euthanasia Ultimately this perilous ethical minefield could arouse more emotions than the national debate over abortion at the other end of life Technology and Death Such ethical quandaries are troubling to a society that once saw death as an inevitable decision to be made by God As late as 1950 most Americans died at home in familiar surroundings with relatives and the family doctor standing by painfully aware of their powerlessness But the advent of miracle drugs iron lungs and respirators artificial kidney machines organ transplants and devices to restart failed organs gave humans the ability to prolong life often beyond the will to live it This expensive technology was gathered in institutions hospitals and nursing homes where today 80 percent of all American deaths occur Beyond creating helpful legal precedents the New Jersey rulings are likely to have other effects First they promise to keep the debate focused on ethical and moral issues rather than on the financial implications of prolonging expensive care They are also apt to enhance public awareness of the kinds of measures one may seek or even demand from doctors who are often reluctant to share such decisionmaking authority Public opinion polls have shown a dramatic shift in the last generation from a majority opposed to pulling the plug to a twothirds majority in favor of giving patients this right Americans have long shied from the subject of death only about onethird have regular wills when they die although many lavish countless hours on such transitory concerns as avoiding inheritance taxes By giving so much weight to the known wishes of a patient competent or not the New Jersey decisions are likely to enhance the attraction of an even rarer commodity living wills which certify in advance how a terminally ill patient would like to be treated and when he would like the treatment to stop
IN THE BALANCE; REAGAN GETS HIS CHANCE TO TILT THE HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/weekinreview/in-the-balance-reagan-gets-his-chance-to-tilt-the-high-court.html,SUDDENLY President Reagan has been handed an enormous opportunity perhaps the greatest of his Presidency to leave his mark on the political and legal life of the country The startling announcement on Friday that Justice Lewis F Powell Jr was retiring could bring a historic transformation in the Supreme Court The announcement came just as the Court was issuing the final opinions of the term its first under the conservative Chief Justice William H Rehnquist but one in which the Courts liberaltomoderate coalition still held sway Now that coalition which was often cemented with Justice Powells moderate vote is more precarious The Powell resignation could also transform Mr Reagans final 18 months in office Before the news broke he was a President in failing political health facing an aggressive Democratic Congress and an increasingly skeptical electorate Those problems remain But now Mr Reagan has the chance to make the crucial appointment that could shape the Supreme Court in a way that would give new life to his social goals Although Justice Powell has voted with conservatives on many issues he has cast the critical swing vote on decisions favoring abortion rights and affirmative action He has also been a supporter of civil liberties civil rights and the separation of church and state The President said in two elections that he intends to totally redo the Federal court system noted Senator Patrick J Leahy of Vermont head of a Democratic group that evaluates judicial nominees He wants to change its position on abortion to make some major curtailments in free speech to change its approach on criminal matters and the rights of the accused With the remaining lower court judges he has to appoint and now with the chance to replace the man who has been the pivotal vote in a lot of 5to4 decisions hes probably in a position to carry out the biggest of his campaign promises  to make a major change in the Federal court system for the rest of this century White House officials could barely contain their glee They had almost given up hope that any member of the Courts liberalmoderate bloc would leave the bench soon enough for Mr Reagan to pick his successor Its one more chance to replace activist judges with folks that have more of our kind of philosophy said one senior White House official The conservative forces that came to Washington with Mr Reagan have long resented activist judges The real distinction to be made they say is not between liberals and conservatives but between judges who make law and those who merely interpret existing law Many of us believe said the White House official that one of the biggest problems of the last 20 years has been the tendency of judges to act as if they were a national legislature secondguessing local officials mandating certain social changes that are not within the four corners of the Constitution Fighting the Court in Congress Mr Reagan and his allies have tried for years to persuade Congress to roll back many of the Supreme Court decisions they consider most obnoxious including the legalization of abortion and the banning of organized prayer in public schools They have consistently failed a sign that the Courts rulings are perhaps more in tune with public opinion than is the Reagan ideology While Justice Powells resignation surprised the President he intends to pick a nominee very soon said Marlin Fitzwater Mr Reagans spokesman Mr Reagan wants the new Justice in place when the Court reconvenes in October The more quickly he moves the harder it will be for the Democraticcontrolled Senate to block confirmation by delaying a decision until Mr Reagan is out of office That is why Howard H Baker Jr the White House chief of staff is determined to take control of the nomination process fighting conservative forces at the Justice Department who might lean toward a nominee who cannot be confirmed The person has to be strong on the merits and be able to withstand the closest scrutiny said a White House aide For the first time a nominee will have to go before a body not controlled by your party so you have to take extraspecial care that the appointment is confirmable Justice Powells departure alarms Democrats and they are ready for a fight In the last Congress before they gained control of the Senate Democrats mounted a major effort against several lower court nominees and managed to defeat one of them Jefferson Sessions of Alabama though their prime target Daniel A Manion was narrowly confirmed While the Presidents elevation of Mr Rehnquist to Chief Justice and his nomination of Judge Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice did not threaten to tip the Court the moves were opposed by several key Democrats Accordingly the top priority at the White House is to find a candidate who can win swift approval Federal appeals court judges Robert H Bork of the District of Columbia Circuit and Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit in Chicago are frequently mentioned Both were wellregarded legal scholars before going on the bench Some Democrats think the President might turn to Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee Although Mr Hatch is a strong foe of abortion he might be treated more kindly than many conservatives by his fellow senators Unless the White House picks an extreme conservative with disputable legal credentials the likely outlook is for reasonably quick confirmation Mr Reagans two appointees on the current Court Mr Scalia and Sandra Day OConnor were confirmed unanimously If there is another Scalia or OConnor out there said one White House official I sure hope we know who it is
INSIDE FIGHT SEEN OVER COURT CHOICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/us/inside-fight-seen-over-court-choice.html,The Justice Department and the White House staff have each said they will play the primary role in choosing a successor to Justice Lewis F Powell Jr setting the stage for a battle between conservatives and more moderate elements of the Reagan Administration On the conservative side Terry H Eastland spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said The Attorney General is the Presidents chief adviser in this area and as he did last year in the case of Justice Scalia Mr Meese will recommend to the President a nominee who believes in judicial restraint Baker Reported Set for Role Associate Justice Antonin Scalia a conservative filled the vacancy created by the retirement of Warren E Burger as Chief Justice A senior White House official however maintained that President Reagans chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr would take personal charge of the selection of a nominee to succeed Justice Powell who announced his resignation on Friday citing age and health Mr Baker who at the beginning of the Reagan Administration was the leader of the Senate Republicans when they held the majority is more moderate than the conservatives in the Justice Department and on the basis of his reputation as a consensus builder would be likely to seek a nominee with wide support Marlin Fitzwater the White House spokesman said talks among Presidential aides were being held over the weekend Mr Baker will formally begin considering candidates at a White House meeting Monday that the President may attend The fight for leadership in the selection process goes beyond a simple battle over access to the President Justice Powell played a pivotal role in the Courts decisions on such social issues as abortion and affirmative action casting the deciding fifth vote in close decisions on the ninemember Court Mr Reagan opposes abortion and the conservatives are likely to seek a nominee who would be deemed certain to vote to overturn the Courts decision establishing the right to abortion The moderates would be expected to find someone who might win quick approval in the Democraticcontrolled Senate Rely on Oval Office Another senior White House official said when asked about the forces in the selection process When you have got an appointment at this level it doesnt lend itself to lobbying My conservative friends have to rely on the conservative in the Oval Office to make a decision they will feel good about Robert B Hall an assistant White House press spokesman said there would be no Administration comment on any differences between Attorney General Meese and Mr Baker as to leadership in the selection process Mr Hall said People are thinking about it Obviously it is a very important choice Mr Hall emphasized The President of course will make the final decision Regarding the differences over who will play the principal role in the selection of Justice Powells successor a Justice Department official said his side regarded Mr Baker as a moderate who would probably seek a like moderate such as Mr Powell or Justice Harry A Blackmun Conservatives Favor Bork The officials said the Justice Department preferred a nominee with strong conservative credentials One candidate frequently mentioned favorably by conservatives is Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who has been critical of the Supreme Courts decision upholding the right to abortion and who had been regarded as a leading candidate for the vacancy to which Justice Scalia was named Judge Borks nomination would present a problem for two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware and Paul Simon of Illinois Both are seeking the Democratic nomination for President and would be expected by liberals and womens rights activists to try to block the nomination But Judge Borks credentials are so respected that such an action could be seen as unfair by those who think that highly qualified candidates should not be blocked solely on ideological grounds Another possibility with considerable conservative support is Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah but he could face a constitutional bar The Constitution says that no member of Congress shall be named to any office for which the pay has been increased by Congress while he was a member In February Congress gave the Justices a 6000 salary increase an action that could prevent Senator Hatchs nomination Otherwise because of senatorial courtesy a very strong tradition even liberals in the Senate might find it hard to oppose Senator Hatchs nomination Last Thing They Want Prof Herman Schwartz a professor of constitutional law at American University said that because of the constitutional question the White House might not regard Senator Hatch as the ideal candidate The last thing they want to do is become hung up on that Professor Schwartz said Other than that he said Senator Hatch would be an ideal nominee because he is both young for the Court at the age of 53 and a leader in many issues important to the conservative movement such as opposing abortion and affirmative action and permitting school prayer Some moderates said that Mr Baker himself should not be ruled out even though he said on Friday that he was not a candidate Those favoring him said he had to take that position in view of his assertion of leadership in selecting a nominee since he did not want to appear to be openly seeking the nomination he is trying to oversee
WASHINGTON; Reagan's Thumbprint,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/opinion/washington-reagan-s-thumbprint.html,If youre wondering about Ronald Reagans legacy as President of the United States look to the courts His domestic policies have sunk in a sea of red ink His foreign policy is ending in scandal but his thumbprint will be on the judiciary into the 21st century With the retirement of Lewis F Powell Jr of Virginia Mr Reagan will be able to appoint his third Supreme Court justice In addition he has already appointed a Chief Justice of the United States and 290 or almost 40 percent of the 741 lifetime judges in courts of Federal jurisdiction In short hes running out of everything but luck The chances are that more than half of all the Federal district judges and appeals court judges in the country will be of his choosing before the end of his second term or to put it more accurately of Attorney General Meeses choosing which is not a particularly comforting thought Mr Meese will put somebody in Justice Powells place but replacing him is not the same thing He was one of the most judicial and civil gentlemen who ever sat on the Court faithful only to his own character and the Constitution When observers here say his was often the decisive vote in 5to4 decisions what they mean is that neither the conservatives nor the liberals knew how hed come out on President Reagans social agenda and had to do their best to persuade him Mr Meese may be glad to see him go but not the other members of the Court It is true however that in the Supreme Courts first full term under Chief Justice Rehnquist and with the addition of the new conservative Justice Antonin Scalia the liberals and moderates usually with the vote of Justice Powell managed to prevail This coalition led by Associate Justice William Brennan rejected a challenge to the death penalty and even a case involving the use of income tax returns in death penalty cases It also followed the liberal line on affirmative action cases on the right of working women to pregnancy leaves on asylum for political refugees and the teaching of creationism in public schools With the retirement of Justice Powell however this coalition may not prevail particularly on the controversial issue of the right to abortion which he supported Nothing is riskier in Washington however than predicting how the Court will rule no matter how vigilant Ed Meese is in recommending judges he thinks will vote the Reagan way All you can do is look at the record and here the tendencies of this Administration particularly under the guidance of Mr Meese are fairly clear For one thing Mr Meese gets these lifetime appointees when theyre comparatively young The average age of the secondterm Reagan appointees was 482 years younger than the appointees of the previous four Administrations On average they are not only younger but richer than their predecessors which is another argument for raising judicial salaries and in Reagans second term his appointees had less judicial experience than those of the previous four Administrations Even so while the Reagan appointees voted more conservatively than their predecessors and while Mr Meese has presided over the most systematic ideological screening system since Franklin Roosevelts first term Sheldon Goldman in a careful analysis for the American Judicature Society concludes that there is no objective evidence that a litmus test in terms of specific policy views has been employed to accept or reject candidates Justice Powell didnt give the President advance notice that he was retiring He apparently considered that the age of 79 was an appropriate time to go home and didnt want to quit in a Presidential election year when the question of his replacement would have become a partisan political issue So the President will now look around and hes getting plenty of advice President Nixon once asked Senator Howard Baker if he was interested but withdrew the suggestion after Mr Baker said he was Now after a spell in the White House Mr Baker might think the Court looks pretty good Then there are at least two conservative and distinguished Reagan appointees on the appeals court  Robert Bork and Richard Posner  and if the President is in a fighting mood he could turn to his favorite cheerleader in the Senate Orrin Hatch of Utah Mr Hatch aside any respectable conservative on Mr Meeses short list will undoubtedly be confirmed and the President can go home feeling that the courts if nothing else are in fairly sound conservative hands Then if he can strike a deal with the evil empire on arms control he will leave something behind As Casey Stengel said in retirement You cant lose them all
THE CANDIDATE WHO ISN'T THERE: NONRUNNERS CAST SHADOW ON '88,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/29/us/the-candidate-who-isn-t-there-nonrunners-cast-shadow-on-88.html,Twice last week important Democrats gathered to discuss politics and listen to Senators who most of those present thought would make an excellent President There was only one problem In each case the man in question  Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia the center of attention at a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council in Atlanta and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey who was roasted at a fundraising dinner in Washington  was not running for President And Mr Bradley at least says he is absolutely positively certain he will not run in 1988 Among the unusual aspects of the 1988 Presidential contest already off to an early rocky start is longing for the candidate who isnt there Some Longing for Baker On the Democratic side although seven candidates are in the race and three more are thinking of running many in the party say they want someone else Among the most talkedabout nonrunners are Mr Bradley Mr Nunn and Governor Cuomo of New York Even among Republicans who seem for the moment to have the more orderly battle there is some longing for Howard H Baker Jr who chose to be President Reagans chief of staff rather than be a candidate On both sides moreover partisans of those who are not candidates can concoct ingenious scenarios under which their favorite would be nominated if he entered the race late or even if he did not announce at all They back their claims with polls that show that their prefered noncandidate especially in the cases of Mr Cuomo Mr Bradley and Mr Baker is more popular than most of the willing entrants Aware and Annoyed The actual candidates especially on the Democratic side are well aware of and somewhat annoyed at the interest being generated by those on the sidelines At the roast of Mr Bradley a fundraising event for Independent Action a group that helps liberal Congressional candidates each of the seven candidates present  Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee the Rev Jesse Jackson Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts  expressed gratitude that Mr Bradley has decided not to run Bradleys Internal Clock Mr Biden referring to Mr Bradleys repeated statements that he does not regard himself as ready to run praised the New Jersey Senators internal clock and said he hoped it would keep him on schedule for a Presidential candidacy  in 1996 In Atlanta at the meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council Mr Nunn was besieged by questions about his intentions Friends say the Georgian is moving toward running He coyly said that while he had once been 70 to 30 against running the latest odds were a more favorable 605 to 395 although still against The continuing speculation that Mr Nunn may run has been especially harmful to Mr Gore who is trying to build a base as the Souths only candidate The prospect of Sam Nunn running freezes a lot of people said Dick Lodge the chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party Other Democrats who are known to be considering candidacies are Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Gov Bill Clinton of Arkansas The election of 1988 is plainly not the first in which voters and party leaders have looked outside the roster of volunteers for a nominee Memories of Willkie Wendell Willkie was nominated by the Republicans in 1940 as the result of a brilliantly orchestrated boomlet just before the convention Adlai Stevensons nomination by the Democrats in 1952 was the product of a late draft In 1964 many Republican primary voters wrote in the name of Henry Cabot Lodge then the Ambassador to Vietnam in preference to Nelson A Rockefeller and Barry M Goldwater the ultimate nominee And in 1976 many important Democratic leaders hoped that Hubert H Humphrey would enter the Democratic race late to stop Jimmy Carter Although he did not enter the contest Mr Humphrey usually ran ahead of the candidates on the ballot in polls taken in the key primary states Many politicians see substantial differences from these earlier cases For one thing the way candidates are selected now through a grueling series of primaries is very different from what it was in 1940 1952 or even 1964 although Mr Carters strength through this system in 1976 may have helped keep Mr Humphrey out In the old days convention delegates or the party leaders who controlled them were largely free agents who could shift their support before and at the national convention Now most delegates are bound by the decisions of primary voters at least for the first convention ballot and most are directly selected by candidates who count on their loyalty Memories of Humphrey And those who are not running today unlike Mr Humphrey were never before nominated by their party for national office By 1976 Mr Humphrey had been thought of as a potential President for close to two decades Not so for Mr Bradley Mr Cuomo or Mr Nunn or the even for the more nationally experienced Mr Baker For supporters of the current candidates the most annoying aspect of the interest in the noncandidates is the implicit subtext That those in the race are somehow inadequate to the job Many political professionals dismiss this view and say that the remaining Democrats are suffering from the pall thrown over the contest by Gary Harts abrupt withdrawal amid scandal over his relationship with a Miami woman Donna Rice The whole episode of Gary Hart has put people on hold said Harrison Hickman a Democratic polltaker Elaine Kamarck deputy campaign manager for Mr Babbitt said that talk of new candidacies made it easier for voters and professionals to avoid taking a serious look at the current field It lets people wait until the fall she said New Rules a Factor One influential Midwestern Democratic Congressman said that his party now had a bunch of very good candidates for Vice President But the Congressman who recently attended a convention where many of the candidates spoke said that many Democrats tended to be more enthusiastic about the existing candidates than observers in Washington are Mr Hickman said that another difference from the past is that the new rules of Presidential politics had the effect of encouraging littleknown candidates One of the requirements to be a player in the game used to be that you had to well known he said But with all the publicity that accrues to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary unknowns can count on being instant celebrities if they win in either state Such recognition propelled Mr Carter to the nomination in 1976 and Mr Hart to national prominence in 1984 Mr Gore captures a popular perception that the process has become a trifle absurd with a joke that always draws laughter This Presidential campaign he said seems like the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes Anybody can enter anybody can win A Sign of Affection Mr Gores joke meant to spotlight some Democratic candidates lack of national experience applies less to the other major party The Republicans in the words of Peter Secchia a Republican national committeeman from Michigan like candidates who are already trained Whatever Vice President Bushs political weaknesses may be one of them is assuredly not a lack of experience Much the same can be said of the Senate minority leader Bob Dole of Kansas Thus the enthusiasm Mr Bakers name evokes at Republican meetings is less a negative commentary on the other candidates than it is a sign of the affection for Mr Baker among party regulars and the sense that he could emerge as a unifying force at the end of a potentially bitter battle for the nomination This is a role that lateentering candidates have played throughout American history But on the Democratic side as Mr Gore noted the stature of politicians seems to grow in direct proportion to their distance from the hustings Thus Mr Bradleys insistence that he does not regard himself as being ready to be President comes off as statesmanlike humility  especially when he has been hard pressed to say why he regards other candidates with little more experience as quite prepared for the White House A Personal Explanation In a recent interview Mr Bradley resorted to a highly personal explanation of his own sense of himself and his theory that the United States was such a complicated land that to understand it one needed intense contact with its regions through unhurried travel I happen to think that if you do that you understand America better than if your whole relation to the country is from one tarmac to another tarmac he said But if the noncandidates look especially good many analysts say that is in part because they are preserving themselves from the scrutiny and attack that falls onto those who enter the battle Theyre able to demonstrate their strengths without having to expose their weaknesses said Al From the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council And their support is worth so much that there is no advantage in attacking them so they have a much freer ride in terms of criticism Expert on the Military Mr Nunn is profiting from this phenomenon say many Democrats As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Mr Nunn is seen mainly as a widely respected expert on military and foreign policy and as a moderate conservative who could draw defectors back into the Democratic fold But if he became a candidate Mr Nunns voting record would be open to severe criticism from his more liberal adversaries A recent article in Congressional Quarterly a magazine that closely follows Congress and politics offered a preview of such attacks It noted that Mr Nunn had been well to the right of most Congressional Democrats on issues such as voting rights fair housing abortion and the balanced budget amendment On at least one key issue his recent vote in favor of American aid to the Nicaraguan contras Mr Bradley would face similar scrutiny from his party Several candidates could not resist needling him about it at the recent dinner in his honor Mr Cuomo whose record as Governor would doubtless be subjected to excruciatingly detailed analysis if he ever decided to run has been defending the existing Democratic field and predicting that it would eventually yield a star To be trite but terribly true it is much too early to make any significant judgment on this field of candidates Mr Cuomo said in an interview this week A good deal of the analysis is presumptuous premature and evidences to me a lack of knowledge of

REAGAN TO SELECT NOMINEE FOR COURT WITHIN 2 WEEKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/29/us/reagan-to-select-nominee-for-court-within-2-weeks.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said today that President Reagan would choose a nominee to succeed retiring Justice Lewis F Powell Jr on the Supreme Court within the next week or two weeks at the most Mr Meese said the President would not employ an ideological test in selecting the nominee Hes going to appoint someone based upon that individuals view of the constitutional role of the judiciary Mr Meese said The Attorney Generals comments made on the ABC News program This Week With David Brinkley came amid signs of tension between the White House and the Senate over the timing of confirmation hearings and whether Mr Reagan should appoint a person whose legal views are similar to those of Justice Powell The retiring Justice a moderate cast the pivotal vote on many issues including recent rulings upholding abortion rights and affirmative action Administration officials have said they hope to choose a nominee who would tip the ideological balance on the Court to the right but who would not set off a long confirmation battle with the Democratically controlled Senate Its imperative that the Senate begin hearings on that nomination before the August recess so they can have a justice in place through the whole process in time for the October session of the Court Mr Meese said However Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee have indicated that the panel might move slowly if Mr Reagan selects an ardent conservative Justice Powell stepped down Friday after 15 years on the bench Interviewed today on the CBS News program Face the Nation Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the committees chairman said I think that if they try to find someone in Justice Powells mold there will be little or no major problem in confirmation Conversely if its concluded that there is a desire to move to someone who has a predisposition on every one of the major issues the social issues and wishes to move the Court in a direction where it was 20 to 25 years ago I think there will be some controversy Reagan to Be Involved Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee said Mr Reagan should name a person who can be readily confirmed Mr Meese who would not comment on any individuals under consideration said Mr Reagans choice was likely to be someone not unlike the high quality people he has already appointed to the Court The President appointed Justices Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia He also elevated Justice William H Rehnquist to Chief Justice Mr Meese said Mr Reagan had expressed his desire to be involved in this decision from the start Mr Meese outlined the criteria for evaluating the qualifications of the candidates I think it ought to be someone who has demonstrated competence obviously intellectual ability probably some extensive judicial experience someone who has judicial temperament and integrity and someone who has an understanding and adherence to the role of the judiciary under the constitution that is as a judge or justice who would apply the law and interpret the law not make the law he said Leading Candidates Named A leading candidate is said to be Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who has criticized the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortions Other judges cited as possible candidates include J Clifford Wallace of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Diego Patrick E Higginbotham of the Fifth Circuit in Dallas Ralph K Winter Jr and Roger J Miner of the Second Circuit in New York and Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit in Chicago A popular choice among conservatives is Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican However the constitution bars members of Congress from holding a public office for which Congress has voted a pay raise The Justices were given a 6000 salary increase last February Senator Paul Simon of Illinois a Judiciary Committee Democrat said on the ABC News program that Mr Reaganshould appoint a person who will maintain the Courts existing ideological balance rather than use the appointment to alter the Courts philosophical direction He said the Senate would attempt to elicit general information about the nominees approach to such issues as affirmative action Mr Meese expressed concern about Mr Simons comments It sounds like people of a particular ideological bent want to continue that bent no matter who the President might think would be the best justice he said
A TOUGH-MINDED ECOLOGIST COMES TO DEFENSE OF MALTHUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/science/a-tough-minded-ecologist-comes-to-defense-of-malthus.html,BY ALL appearances Garrett Hardin the renowned ecologist biologist and author could surely be counted on as a conventional believer in the virtue of human charity He has smiling eyes and a friendly face and someone said he could be taken for a beloved smalltown minister In a biographical note he has described himself as a Republican a Unitarian and a father of four So the words of his harsh message could hardly be more jolting Theres nothing more dangerous than a shallowthinking compassionate person Dr Hardin said in a recent interview God he can cause a lot of trouble As a latterday Malthusian who believes that runaway population growth will lead to misery and ruin Dr Hardin was arguing that the gifts of food to faminewracked Ethiopia probably did more harm than good Like many poor countries he said Ethiopia has violated a cardinal principle of ecology Its population exceeds its carrying capacity its developed resources to produce food and wealth Since Ethiopia has far too many people for its resources Dr Hardin went on if you give food and save lives and thus increase the number of people you increase suffering and ultimately increase the loss of life Attacking Taboo Subjects To those familiar with Dr Hardins thinking and writings over the years the blunt words are characteristic and so is the message He is accustomed to attacking taboo subjects whether laissezfaire economics altruism or the Western belief in individualism and progress He has long commanded a wide audience among biologists and environmentalists and in a series of lectures this month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City he showed that he has lost none of his zest for intellectual combat Dr Hardin who had polio as a child and walks with the aid of crutches is now 72 years old and a professor emeritus of human ecology at the University of California at Santa Barbara where he had taught since 1946 He was a leader in the fight for legalized abortions His theories especially his interpretation of the limits to growth in a finite world served as scientific underpinning to the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s The most recent of his dozen books is the 1985 work Filters Against Folly How to Survive Despite Economists Ecologists and the Merely Eloquent He still sprinkles his writing and conversation with the maxims that are his trademark They are drawn from ecology but are freighted with political and economic implications You can never do just one thing Not to act is to act And his favorite Thou shalt not violate carrying capacity In his lectures this month he defended Malthusian theory which has been discredited by most economists as a rational view of population dynamics At the end of the 18th century Thomas Robert Malthus an English clergyman and economist postulated that population naturally tends to grow geometrically In a finite world this means the percapita share of the worlds goods must steadily decrease But a kind of equilibrium is maintained he said by war and pestilence or finally by famine that with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world Implicit in Malthusian thinking Dr Hardin suggested is an understanding of the modern cybernetic principle of negative or corrective feedback Population is maintained at a certain level much the same way as a thermostat controls the temperature of a room at a set point The set point in population is determined by the nature of things Thus according to Malthus as interpreted by Dr Hardin any improvement in the production of food would soon be nullified by the resultant growth of population and vice versa Technology as the Answer Since the time of Malthus world population has grown from 900 million to about 5 billion without quite the dire consequences he had predicted Malthus had failed to recognize the importance of technology in raising sharply the set point on what Dr Hardin calls the demostat This led many economists to believe that Malthus has been disproved and it encouraged the vision that with modern technology bigger populations could be accommodated perhaps even with an improved standard of living As Dr Hardin noted Malthus has been denounced by both liberals because of his pessimistic view of human nature and conservatives because he disparaged perpetual growth Much the same could be said of Dr Hardin for reasons perhaps made clearest in a 1968 essay that has been widely cited ever since Entitled The Tragedy of the Commons the essay summed up the ecological basis for his conviction that population growth cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely Dr Hardin illustrated the concept of carrying capacity with calculations by an obscure 19thcentury English mathematician William Lloyd These showed how a community pasture or commons would eventually become overgrazed if each herdsman was allowed to decide the number of cattle he would graze there If for example a herdsman decided to add one too many cows to the commons all the profit from the additional cow would be his while the other herdsmen would share the losses resulting from the overgrazing of the land Soon the others would follow his example each acting rationally to maximize his gain There is the tragedy Dr Hardin wrote Each man is locked in a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit  in a world that is limited Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom on the commons The essay was a forceful attack on the idea first enunciated by Adam Smith and fundamental to freeenterprise economics that decisions reached individually will by the invisible hand tend to contribute to the social good At the same time the essay found value in private ownership  when the user is responsible for the costs of his decisions Dr Hardin concluded that the commons can be justifiable only when population density is low Similarly he said the environment is an abused commons today Commonizing costs while privatizing profits continues to waste the worlds resources he said this month Although environmental activists often treated the essay as gospel some have recently objected to Dr Hardins premise that the Earth is a closed isolated ecosystem They argue that the inexhaustible supply of solar energy could counteract the effect of the second law of thermodynamics which is that in an isolated system useful energy is always decreasing Barry Commoner a biologist at Queens College of the City University of New York who is a leading spokesman of the environmental movement made this point in an article in the June 15 New Yorker The ultimate limit on economic growth he wrote is imposed by the rate at which renewable solar energy can be captured and used Hunger and overpopulation he said are signs of economic and political problems that can be solved humanely by economic and political means This was in part a response to another of Dr Hardins essays Living on a Lifeboat in which he espoused a seemingly coldhearted thesis that has aroused a chorus of criticism According to Dr Hardins lifeboat ethic if a country produces more people and appeals for help to keep from sinking others should ignore the appeal and concentrate on keeping their own boats afloat This is the basis for Dr Hardins opposition to sending food to Ethiopia because he said it would only contribute to overpopulation Result not Cause The fatal flaw in this reasoning is that excess population is a result of poverty not the other way around argued Arthur Simon executive director of Bread for the World a publicpolicy organization in Washington In countries without adequate forms of social security Mr Simon said the desperately poor have as many children as they can to assure they will have surviving sons to support them in their old age In places where the poor are improving themselves he added they begin voluntarily to have fewer children Beyond that he said the lifeboat ethic is just not morally acceptable Many of Dr Hardins critics note that the world produces more than enough food to feed the total world population today The real problem they argue is the uneven distribution of the food supply which is not an ecological phenomenon but a political and economic one If the criticism bothers him Dr Hardin does not show it In the interview he said When you propose doing something ask if it will help not just for the moment but for the future Most aid does more harm than good The overriding issue he said is that people cannot continue to violate the ecological principle of carrying capacity and expect technology to assure endless resources Anyone who believes that he asserted should have no trouble believing in perpetual motion

BYRD SAYS BORK NOMINATION WOULD FACE SENATE TROUBLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/us/byrd-says-bork-nomination-would-face-senate-trouble.html,The Senate majority leader today threatened to move slowly on President Reagans nominee for the Supreme Court if Republicans in the Senate continued to block action on major bills The majority leader Robert C Byrd Democrat of West Virginia also said a nomination of Judge Robert H Bork a leading contender to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Justice Lewis F Powell Jr would be inviting problems in the Senate because of his role in the Watergate scandals Judge Bork who was then Solicitor General dismissed Archibald Cox as the special Watergate prosecutor under orders of President Nixon after two higher ranking officials had refused to do so Mr Byrd would not say if he thought Judge Bork who sits on the Federal court of appeals here was inflexibly wedded to judicial issues that would make him unacceptable to Democrats on ideological grounds When pressed on the chances for approval of Judge Bork Mr Byrd said he could be confirmed A Call to Block Any Extremist At the same time the No 2 Democrat in the Senate Alan Cranston of California the party whip urged colleagues in a letter to form a solid phalanx of opposition if the Presidents nominee was an ideological extremist Some Democrats in Congress are worried that Mr Reagan will nominate a conservative who will be committed to overturning Supreme Court decisions on abortion and other issues Mr Byrds comments came as Administration officials met today to choose candidates to recommend to the President Justice Powell surprised Washington and the White House with his resignation Friday It might not be a bad idea to say there are equally important matters facing the Senate Mr Byrd told reporters at a luncheon meeting If were going to have all this stalling by the Republicans then lets just slow down and take a closer look at this nomination Mr Byrds threat does not mean he would delay the nomination indefinitely But it indicated that he was willing to hold up the nomination as leverage to force the White House to help him break Republican delaying tactics in the Senate that are holding up consideration of bills on military programs and campaign financing Theyre Going to Pay What we see now is a policy of confrontation from the White House and the Republicans in the Senate Mr Byrd said Its a pattern of obstruction But Mr Byrd said the Republicans and the White House would not succeed Im going to hit them where it hurts he said referring to delaying planned recesses and keeping the Senate in session into November Theyre going to pay he said The Republicans have blocked action on the 1988 military programs bill because they are opposed to Democratic language that would slow development of Mr Reagans spacebased antimissile program They are also fighting the Democrats campaign financing bill because it would put limits on spending and includes some public financing for elections
BORK NOMINATION TO COURT WEIGHED BY THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/us/bork-nomination-to-court-weighed-by-the-president.html,Amid growing indications that President Reagan is moving toward nominating Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court White House officials today spent the day sounding out the appeals court judges prospects for Senate confirmation Administration officials said Judge Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was the first choice of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and senior Justice Department officials to replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who retired from the Court on Friday At the same time White House officials were soliciting advice from legislators and Congressional experts on whether Judge Bork who is 60 years old could be confirmed without becoming embroiled in a long confirmation battle Role in Watergate Scandal The White House officials have been exploring his role in the dismissal of Archibald Cox as special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal in 1973 in what has become known as the Saturday night massacre The Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd said that nominating Judge Bork would be inviting problems in the Senate because of his role in that episode [ Page B20 ] But another key figure in the Saturday night massacre former Attorney General Elliot L Richardson today praised Mr Borks role White House officials said it was unclear if Judge Borks nomination would also be supported by Howard H Baker Jr the White House chief of staff One senior official said that several ranking White House aides had proposed Judge Borks selection to the chief of staff but that Mr Baker had not given a response Still No Final Decision A senior White House official said that Judge Borks name was being circulated as the leading candidate but that no final decision had been made at the White House late today He said other names which he did not identify remained on a short list that Judge Bork heads if reasons develop for the President not to name him Judge Bork a conservative was a leading candidate when President Reagan selected Antonin Scalia to replace Justice William H Rehnquist whom the President elevated to Chief Justice last June Administration officials said Judge Bork was the consensus choice of Mr Meese and top Justice Department officials and one senior official said they regarded his prospects of being confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice very high Mr Meese discussed candidates with Mr Baker and President Reagan at a meeting today that lasted nearly an hour Youll have the legal world in his support the official said adding that in light of Judge Borks outstanding credentials as a legal scholar the American Bar Association and many mainstream legal scholars would support him as highly qualified for the Court and thereby leave isolated liberals who attack the judge as a rigid conservative ideologue But Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights the principal lobbying arm for more than 100 civil rights and womens rights groups rejected that view A Bork nomination or the nomination of anyone who would jeopardize the civil rights accomplishments of the past 30 years would most likely precipitate the most controversial and confrontational legislative battle of the Reagan years he said Mr Neas declined to say whether the Leadership Conference would oppose a Bork nomination But he stressed that with so much at stake I am confident the Senate will stop any nominee who would roll back the clock with respect to the civil rights achievements of the past three decades Exploration Attempts According to Congressional and White House officials Judge Borks possible appointment was explored with several people on Capitol Hill including Strom Thurmond the ranking minority member on the Senate Judiciary Committee Aides to both Mr Baker and Mr Meese have sought in recent days to portray each man as having the primary role in advising the President on the selection Today Marlin Fitzwater the White House spokesman said that the two officials had a joint role and that no split existed In 1973 at the height of the Watergate scandal Mr Bork emerged as a figure in the Saturday night massacre after President Nixon directed Attorney General Richardson to dismiss Mr Cox Mr Richardson who had made a commitment to the Senate not to dismiss the special prosecutor resigned instead as did the departments secondranking official Deputy Attorney General William D Ruckelshaus That left Mr Bork the solictor general as acting Attorney General He dismissed Mr Cox on the Presidents orders a move that came under criticism from some in Congress Mr Richardson who is now practicing law stirred interest today when he was observed entering the White House Later he said he had visited Frank C Carlucci the national security adviser on matters unrelated to the Supreme Court vacancy Richardson Praises Bork In a telephone interview Mr Richardson said he believed that Mr Bork had performed honorably in the incident and that he deserved credit I had asked the legal counsel to check whether Nixon had the right to fire Cox Mr Richardson said The legal counsel concluded that he did Therefore we thought Bork could do the right thing and deliver that message Bork deserves a lot of credit for standing up to Nixon and telling him to appoint another special prosecutor Bork weighed in with the President that he had to appoint a new one and help to line up Jaworski he said referring to Leon Jaworski Mr Coxs successor Mr Richardson said that in a chance encounter with Judge Bork on a Washington street today he had indicated his support for the Judges nomination Maybe he is a little more conservative than I am but he is a fine guy Mr Richardson said in the interview Some liberal groups have argued that Mr Bork performed improperly in the incident by dismissing Mr Cox and Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee indicated that he would explore the incident in confirmation hearings if Mr Bork was nominated Earlier today Mr Fitzwater said that Mr Reagan would seek the best candidate possible and that he wanted a nominee who shares his view of the strict interpretation of the Constitution Beyond that broad consideration he said no other guideposts were being set including whether a candidate was likely to rule against legalizing abortion No Specific Issues as Test There are no specific issues that will be a litmus test he said Indicating that confirmation of Mr Reagans choice might be difficult Mr Fitzwater criticized what he said was an attempt by some senators to inject political considerations into the process by indicating that they would question a candidate on ideological issues The spokesman referred by name to Senator Biden whose Judiciary Committee must approve the nomination In an interview Sunday on the CBS News program Face the Nation Senator Biden who is seeking the Presidential nomination said that if its concluded that there is a desire to move to someone who has a predisposition on every one of the major issues the social issues and wishes to move the Court in a direction where it was 20 to 25 years ago I think there will be some controversy Mr Fitzwater said I find it a little troublesome that any senator would make comments on a proposal before we even have a nominee Mr Biden is in somewhat unique circumstances politically But I would just urge everyone to wait till they see who the candidate is Mr Fitzwater added that he hoped the Senate would join us in considering the best candidate for the Court and the outstanding judicial record that the candidate brings to the nomination and not dissolve themselves into political considerations or just follow party lines Reagan Confident on Role Mr Reagan in another development today dismissed suggestions that his Presidency was at the lowest ebb ever an assertion reported in a frontpage article Sunday in The New York Times The article quoted Congressional leaders Administration officials confidants of the President and others who shared that view Without referring to the article directly Mr Reagan told Republican political activists invited to the White House that he planned to pursue his priorities aggressively throughout the remaining 18 months of his term All those who talk about lame ducks and the postReagan era are dead wrong the President said I cant help noticing that theyre the same gurus whose mantra for the last years has been This too shall pass There will be no postReagan era because theres been no Reagan era in the way those people mean it This has been the era of the American people Leaders may come and go When it comes to the American people their truth keeps marching on Mr Reagan warned the Democraticcontrolled Congress that he would veto any legislation that raised taxes and said that the budget resolution approved last week was dead on arrival

BORK PICKED FOR HIGH COURT; REAGAN CITES HIS 'RESTRAINT'; CONFIRMATION FIGHT LOOMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-picked-for-high-court-reagan-cites-his-restraint-confirmation-fight-looms.html,President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Judge Robert H Bork to the United States Supreme Court setting the stage for a bitter battle in the Senate over his confirmation Mr Reagans selection of Judge Bork a strongly conservative member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is widely seen as tipping the ideological balance of the Court to the right Judge Borks previous rulings suggest that if confirmed he might provide the critical fifth vote needed to restrict or overturn such Supreme Courts decisions as the 1973 ruling recognizing a constitutional right to abortion The President called Judge Bork the most prominent intellectual advocate of judicial restraint Followers of this doctrine say policy should be set only by elected officials except where the Constitution specifies a role for the courts Long Fight Is Foreseen Mr Reagan also urged the Senate to expedite confirmation proceedings to allow the Court to be at full strength when its term begins in October However key Senators predicted a long fight and said the outcome was uncertain Senator Joseph R Biden Jr a Democratic Presidential candidate and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said the nomination of Judge Bork would produce a very contentious and serious fight in the Senate [ Page A22 ] A senior White House official acknowledged the potential of a difficult Congressional battle and said Mr Reagan was aware of it in making the choice He said the President would try to insure Judge Borks confirmation by waging an active campaign To Replace Powell If confirmed by the Senate Judge Bork would replace Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who announced his retirement last Friday In his 15 years on the Court Justice Powell was at the center of an often polarized bench and cast the swing vote in a number of key cases upholding affirmative action and abortion rights Judge Bork 60 years old appeared with Mr Reagan in the White House briefing room this afternoon Mr Reagan read a brief statement but neither would answer questions Reactions to his selection were mixed Judge Bork came under immediate attack by some Democrats and civil rights groups who assailed his role in the dismissal in 1973 of Archibald Cox as special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal and his opposition in 1963 to proposed legislation barring some private establishments from excluding blacks Citing both incidents Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts urged the Senate to reject his nomination Liberal groups such as People for the American Way the Womens Legal Defense Fund the Alliance for Justice and the National Abortion Rights Action League urged that the Senate reject Judge Bork With the nomination of Robert H Bork a womans right to choose an abortion is threatened asserted Kate Michelman the executive director of the abortion rights group But other organizations such as National Right to Life Committee and the Concerned Women for America praised the nomination Still others including the AFLCIO urged senators to withhold judgment until there was a thorough investigation of Judge Borks background and judicial philosophy Before being appointed to the Court of Appeals in 1982 Judge Bork served as Solicitor General from 1973 to 1977 He was a leading candidate for the Supreme Court in June 1986 when Mr Reagan named Antonin Scalia to replace Justice William H Rehnquist whom he elevated to Chief Justice Outstanding Intellect In announcing the selection today Mr Reagan sought to emphasize Judge Borks intellect while avoiding mention of the impact the conservative jurist could have on such issues as abortion In articles he has written Judge Bork has been critical of the Supreme Courts decision in 1973 that legalized abortion However friends say he does not appear to have strong moral views on the subject but rather regards its as a matter for the legislative branch rather than the Court In his announcement Mr Reagan said that Judge Borks outstanding intellect and unrivaled scholarly credentials are reflected in his thoughtful examination of the broad fundamental legal issues of our times Noting that the American Bar Association had rated him exceptionally well qualified when he was nominated to the appeals court Mr Reagan praised his performance as a judge On the bench he has been wellprepared evenhanded and openminded the President said He added Judge Bork widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint shares my view that judges personal preferences and values should not be part of their constitutional interpretations The guiding principle of judicial restraint recognizes that under the Constitution it is the exclusive province of the legislatures to enact laws and the role the courts to interpret them Less of a Surprise Judge Bork is the third person selected by Mr Reagan for the Court The selection lacked the drama of his first in 1981 when he named Sandra Day OConnor as the first woman on the Court and it was less of a surprise than the 1986 nomination of Justice Scalia which had remained a wellkept secret beforehand Judge Bork had been mentioned by Administration officials as the likely choice almost immediately after Justice Powell announced his retirement The selection appeared almost certain on Monday when Administration officials indicated that he was the top choice of Atttorney General Edwin Meese 3d and senior Justice Department officials But some doubts were raised Tuesday when White House officials said that Howard H Baker Jr the chief of staff was seeking assurances that Judge Bork could be confirmed and thus would not become embroiled in prolonged hearings that might distract the Administration from other issues Eventually Mr Baker also supported the selection He Was Confirmed Once Mr Reagans previous Court nominees have each been confirmed when Republicans were in the majority in the Senate In addition the perception on Capitol Hill was that those nominees would not tip the balance on the Court an issue that has dominated the debate since Justice Powell announced his retirement Even so top Reagan advisers asserted that the full Senate would not make ideology the overriding factor in the confirmation process and would find it difficult to reject a judge who had been previously confirmed without dissent for the bench He was confirmed once one senior White House official said It would be tough for the Senate to go back and say it made a mistake one senior White House official said Opponents however said the issue is not simply whether Judge Bork was qualified in terms of intellect and integrity but in the words of Ms Michelman whether any President has a mandate to remake the Constitution in his own image Terry Eastland a spokesman for the Justice Department said that based on Judge Borks legal qualifications and the Administrations consultations Tuesday with Congressional leaders on the selection the Administration believed he could be confirmed by October Senate rejection of the nomination would be a major setback to Mr Reagan and would run counter to the Senates practice of consenting to most Presidential requests regarding candidates to the Supreme Court The last time a Presidential nominee for the Court was rejected came in April 1970 when the Senate turned down President Nixons choice of Judge G Harrold Carswell Four months earlier the Senate rejected Mr Nixons first choice for the seat Judge Clement F Haynsworth Jr No Animosity Seen Marlin Fitzwater the White House spokesman said that the President expected Judge Bork to be confirmed based on his judicial record and the fact that he is well known within the Washington legal establishment and Congress We expect opposition to any conservative from a Democratic controlled committee but there doesnt appear to be any deepseated animosity he said White House officials had viewed the retirement of Justice Powell as an opportunity for the President to take a significant action at a time when his Administration is under fire regarding its role in the Irancontra affair Officials had sought to portray Mr Reagan as actively involved in the selection process When the announcement was made today he appeared without his usual complement of aides Mr Reagan had discussed candidates with Mr Meese over the weekend He met with Mr Baker and Mr Meese on Monday and held a second meeting on the choice today before making the final decision Before the announcement Mr Reagan also met with Senator Strom Thurmond a Republican from South Carolina and the ranking minority member on the Judiciary Committee Mr Thurmond had been lobbying for the nomination of someone from the South since Justice Powell a lawyer from Richmond is a southerner The Justice Department and White House officials had considered at least two Senators Orrin G Hatch Utah Republican and Howell Heflin an Alabama Democrat reasoning that they might be more easily confirmed by their colleagues than a sitting judge But ultimately they decided that Mr Bork could be confirmed and that the strategy of nominating a Senator would make more sense in 1988 if Mr Reagan had an opportunity to name another justice In 1988 one official said electionyear politics would pose larger threats to confirmation
MAN IN THE NEWS; A MULTIFACETED CONSERVATIVE: ROBERT HERON BORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/man-in-the-news-a-multifaceted-conservative-robert-heron-bork.html,Judge Robert H Bork is a multifaceted man with a powerful and restless intellect He is a committed conservative who has accused the Supreme Court of usurping the powers of elected officials in dozens of decisions including those Court decisions that protect abortion rights If confirmed by the Senate over the passionate opposition of liberals the 60yearold jurist may be in a position to cement a majority on the sharply divided court to restrict or overrule many of those decisions Judge Borks record suggests he would move the law of the land sharply to the right on issues like the death penalty homosexual rights government aid to religious schools sexual harassment of women access to the courts Presidential power the constitutionality of the special prosecutor law antitrust and perhaps affirmative action [ A sampler page A22 ] He has publicly said the Supreme Court was wrong to recognize a constitutional right to abortion Friends Span Political Spectrum But while Judge Borks legal philosophy coincides with President Reagans positions on many key issues his views on some issues have changed significantly over the years and he has broken sharply with fellow conservatives on occasion most notably on libel law He is known by admiring friends and former professional associates across the political spectrum as a deep thinker of engaging wit and firm integrity who has worked comfortably with people who do not share his strong conservative philosophy In articles written before he became a judge he has deplored the Supreme Courts decisions upholding abortion as a constitutional right as judicial imperialism while at the same time opposing legislative efforts to overrule them as dangerous encroachments on the Supreme Courts role in defining constitutional rights Former Yale Professor He has called for drastically restricting some categories of free speech like sexually explicit speech and advocacy of overthrowing the Government while taking an expansive view of freedom of the press in the context of libel suits by public figures The former Yale law professor was Solicitor General of the United States from 1973 to 1977 and was appointed by President Reagan in 1982 to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge Borks nomination to the Supreme Court is passionately opposed by many liberals who say they fear that he would provide the fifth vote to overrule or restrict the Courts abortion decisions and other liberal rulings They also view him as a threat to civil rights and have not forgiven him for following President Nixons order to dismiss Archibald Cox as the first Watergate special prosecutor on Oct 20 1973 Reversal on Race Seventeen days later he warned Congress that proposed legislation to make the next special prosecutor independent of the President could be unconstitutional Such legislation was adopted in 1978 and Judge Borks position on it is of particular interest because it is being challenged now by two former aides to Mr Reagan who are targets of investigations by special prosecutors The issue is almost certain to come before the Supreme Court Opponents have also drawn attention to what they call the shocking racial insensitivity of a 1963 magazine article in which Mr Bork denounced a major civil rights bill to bar hotels restaurants and other private businesses that serve the general public from refusing to serve blacks Calling the proposal a dangerous departure from freedom of the individual to decide with whom he will deal the article called civil rights demonstrators a mob coercing and disturbing other private individuals in the exercise of their freedom The idea of legislating morality in this manner he said was a principle of unsurpassed ugliness Ruling on Homosexuality But Mr Bork said in a 1973 hearing on his nomination to be Solicitor General that he had taken the wrong tack in that article and had come to believe in the ban on racial discrimination in public accommodations which Congress passed in 1964 The objection to legislation that enforces majoritarian morality at the expense of individual freedom contrasts with the rationale of Judge Borks 1984 ruling that private consensual homosexual conduct is not constitutionally protected In that case he specifically rejected the argument of a man discharged from the Navy for homosexual conduct that the moral preferences of the majority in particular majority disapproval of homosexuality could not be a constitutional basis for legislation This theory that majority morality and majority choice is always made presumptively invalid by the Constitution attacks the very predicate of democratic government Judge Bork said U of Chicago Graduate Robert Heron Bork was born March 1 1927 in Pittsburgh He is a graduate of the University of Chicago and its law school His conservative views of the law especially antitrust law have been strongly influenced by the freemarket Chicago School approach to economics Despite his reputation for intellectual brilliance Judge Bork has on occasion had difficulty staying interested in his work in particular in some of the highly technical regulatory cases that come before his appeals court The quantity of his scholarly output as a professor was modest His first wife the former Claire Davidson died in 1980 after a long bout with cancer They had two sons and a daughter He is now married to the former Mary Ellen Pohl Friends say he has been eclectic in his personal associations and counts some prominent liberals among his best friends One friend said this week He was raised as a Protestant his first wife was Jewish and now hes married to a former Catholic nun That tells you something about him He gets along with a wide spectrum of people Former Solicitor General As Solicitor General he compiled a moderate sometimes even liberal record on employment discrimination and some other civil rights issues although civil rights lawyers assailed him today for having opposed at that time courtordered school desegregation by means of busing Judge Bork has said little if anything publicly about current civil rights issues in particular job preferences for women and minorities Administration officials privately express confidence however that he would share its view that racial preferences benefiting women and minorities who cannot personally prove themselves victims of discrimination at the expense of white men are illegal View on Abortion Is Clear If so he could be in a position to narrow five Supreme Court decisions in the past 14 months that have rejected  in two cases by 54 margins  the Administrations position and have broadly endorsed some uses of affirmative action There is no doubt about one thing Where Judge Bork stands on the Supreme Courts 1973 decision striking down state antiabortion laws as unconstitutional I am convinced as I think almost all constitutional scholars are that Roe v Wade is an unconstitutional decision a serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority Mr Bork then a Yale law professor said in Congressional testimony in 1981 Opposed Antiabortion Law His views on the 1973 abortion rights decision could be critical because four of the Courts current members have made it clear they would cut it back and at least three of them seem likely to vote to overule it One measure of the mans complexity however is that he urged Congress to reject as unconstitutional the socalled human life bill which sought legislatively to overrule Roe v Wade in the same 1981 testimony in which he denounced that decision The Right to Govern Friends say he does not appear to have passionate views either in favor of or aginst abortion as a moral matter His position is that the legality of abortion is a matter for the elected representatives of the people not the Supreme Court Judge Bork has linked his conservative positions to a deep conviction that what he has called the modern activist liberal Supreme Court has wrongly usurped the powers of elected officials The Constitution is the judges only mandate and if he is wrong if he denies the right to govern of persons who have been elected as he has not been then he commits a mortal sin against the very constitutional order he is sworn to defend he said in a 1982 speech to the American Jewish Committee He has long been the leading exponent of the view that judges must adhere to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution Views on Antitrust Law This overall philosophy has led Judge Bork to agree with Reagan conservatives on most  but not all  ideologically charged issues that come before the Supreme Court One issue on which he has vigorously disagreed with other conservatives  including Justice Antonin Scalia a friend and former colleague on the appeals court who was elevated to the Supreme Court last year  is Judge Borks view that the judiciary must broaden its rules shielding the press from the remarkable upsurge in libel actions His major scholarly work The Antitrust Paradox A Policy At War With Itself in 1978 was an attack on prevailing Supreme Court antitrust doctrine as harmful to consumers and a call for relaxing restraints on mergers and other rules protecting small competitors against big companies Antitrust law has moved significantly in his direction since that influential book in part because of it
SENATORS' REMARKS PORTEND A BITTER DEBATE OVER BORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/senators-remarks-portend-a-bitter-debate-over-bork.html,A bitter and largely partisan battle over the confirmation of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court appeared virtually certain today as key Democratic senators predicted a long fight with an uncertain outcome Senator Joseph R Biden Jr chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he warned top Reagan Administration officials Tuesday that the nomination of Judge Bork would cause a very contentious and serious fight in the United States Senate Senator Biden who is seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination spoke at a news conference in Houston before a debate among the Democratic candidates He said he had serious doubts about the nomination because Judge Bork appears to be settled in all his views The Delaware Democrat added Unless he can demonstrate that he carries to the Court more of an open mind I would have a tough time Kennedys Remarks Scathing While Mr Biden left himself some maneuvering room another Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts staked out a position of implacable opposition Senator Kennedy in a statement his office released moments after the nomination was announced said Judge Borks rigid ideology will tip the scales of justice against the kind of country America is and ought to be Aside from ideology Mr Kennedy said Mr Borks action as Solicitor General in 1973 dismissing Archibald Cox as the Watergate special prosecutor is sufficient by itself to disquality Mr Bork The Judiciary Committee has eight Democrats and six Republicans A 7to7 tie would permit the nomination to go to the Senate floor A defeat in the committee would kill the nomination Richardsons Remarks Recalled Senator Biden indicated that he did not at this stage view the Watergate incident as a serious problem for the nominee He noted that Elliot L Richardson who resigned as President Nixons Attorney General rather than dismiss Mr Cox said recently that he viewed Mr Borks role as honorable Even Democrats who said they planned to keep an open mind predicted that the confirmation battle would extend well past the Oct 5 opening of the next Supreme Court term Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama who said he had no preconceived position one way or another predicted that the Judiciary Committees investigation of Judge Bork would be the most complete and exhaustive investigation of anyone ever nominated for the Supreme Court He said the Senate is unlikely to act before November Hatch Vows to Help Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who vowed to do everything in my power to help Judge Bork any way I can also predicted a very bruising hard set of proceedings Senator Hatch who was himself considered for the vacancy said Democrats would hurt themselves by blocking the nomination of someone he called one of the quintessential judges in the country Told of Senator Hatchs warning Senator Alan Cranston of California the majority whip countered The Democrats will be respected for examining this nomination in great and careful depth But Senator Hatchs comments underscored the political delicacy of the situation both for the Senates Democratic majority and for individual Democratic senators The party in control of the Senate for the first time in the Reagan Presidency must walk a fine line in dealing with a nomination that key elements of its constituency find unpalatable on ideological grounds but that appears beyond reproach by the usual tests of competence and experience Biden in Tough Spot Two of the eight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee Senator Biden and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois are running for President Senator Simon said today in Houston that he would reserve judgment But he said he had some concerns about whether Judge Bork was sensitive to civil rights and civil liberties But it is Senator Biden the committees chairman who is under the most pressure Democratis politicians who requested anonymity today said that the pressures on Mr Biden came from many directions He needs to satisfy party liberals especially those who have been skeptical of his position on abortion While opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion Mr Biden has also opposed using Federal funds to pay for abortions for poor women The forceful statement by Senator Kennedy may make it difficult for Senator Biden to adhere to the rather mild tone he adopted today On the other hand these politicians said Senator Biden must take care to look Presidential rather than partisan or shrill Rights Groups Gear Up Major civil rights organizations meanwhile made it clear that defeat of the nomination was their overriding priority for the balance of the year A statement by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights a coalition of 185 organizations said Judge Bork was an ultra conservative whose confirmation would jeopardize the civil rights achievements of the past three decades Among the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee five voted against the nomination of William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice last year and three voted for him Those three  Robert C Byrd of West Virginia now the majority leader Senator Heflin and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona All three said they had not made up their minds about the Bork nomination
"Judge Bork, the Senate and Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/opinion/judge-bork-the-senate-and-politics.html,Theres no getting politics out of a nomination to the Supreme Court Political justice and a politicized judiciary are to be avoided but picking a justice is a political act Thats why President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert Bork will test the Senate It has not only a right but a duty to scrutinize Judge Borks philosophy every bit as carefully as his credentials Presidents usually get their way with cabinet nominations and should They are entitled to the assistance in the executive branch of people they trust and respect But the Supreme Court is different Its a separate branch of government and the Senates advice and consent is an integral part of the appointment process Howard Baker Mr Reagans chief of staff acknowledges that sensibly when he says The President looks at this as a partnership venture between the executive branch and the Senate Just as a President reflects his political values by whom he nominates the Senate needs to reflect its political values by whom it approves The Supreme Court may follow the election returns the fate of Supreme Court nominations surely does The relevant elections are not only those of 1980 and 1984 when the operative word was landslide The 1986 election put Democrats in control of the Senate and made the operative word lame duck When the very conservative Justice William Rehnquist was promoted to Chief Justice a year ago and Justice Antonin Scalia appointed and confirmed the President was riding high The Republicans not only controlled the Senate but also controlled the pace of Judiciary Committee proceedings Now Mr Reagan has not only lost control of the Senate but also public trust Attorney General Meese his prime counselor on judicial appointments is under several investigations Meanwhile the Supreme Court remains gingerly balanced on matters of civil rights churchstate relations and personal liberty including a womans right to choose abortion One vote on the Court could make as big a difference on such issues as a change of President or control of Congress Robert Bork is a lawyer and judge of formidable intellect His wit and charm made him a hit with Yale law students of all philosophical persuasions As a member of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington he has conspicuously shared Reagan Administration views on major legal issues Only a rigorous confirmation process including careful review of his extensive written record and testimony from supporters and opponents can determine whether his strengths and views qualify him The Senate will need to inquire particularly into Judge Borks illegal 1973 firing of Archibald Cox the special Watergate prosecutor notwithstanding the exoneration now offered by former Attorney General Elliot Richardson A President possesses no celestial or constitutional mandate to impose his political views on a whole branch of government for a decade or more The Senate labors under no duty to accept even a capable nominee whose views it disagrees with whether alone or taken together with those of other members of the Court Beyond partisanship the Senates constitutional and political duty is to examine and crossexamine this nominee with care and courtesy inspecting his record thoroughly and deciding fairly whether it agrees with Mr Reagan that Judge Bork is suited for this seat at this moment in history

"IN BORK'S WORDS: ABORTION, DEATH PENALTY, GAY RIGHTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/in-bork-s-words-abortion-death-penalty-gay-rights.html,Abortion I am convinced as I think almost all constitutional scholars are that Roe v Wade is an unconstitutional decision a serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority I also think that Roe v Wade is by no means the only example of such unconstitutional behavior by the Supreme Court  From June 1 1981 testimony to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Death Penalty The death penalty is specifically referred to and assumed to be an available penalty in the Constitution itself In the Fifth Amendment and in the 14th Amendment It is a little hard to understand how a penalty that the framers explicitly assumed to be available can somehow become unavailable because of the very Constitution the framers wrote     From an interview in the November December 1985 issue of Judicial Notice Original Intent Original intent is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision    The only way in which the Constitution can constrain judges is if the judges interpret the documents words according to the intentions of those who drafted proposed and ratified its provisions and various amendments    It is not the notion that judges may apply a constitutional provision only to circumstances specifically contemplated by the framers    We are able to apply the First Amendments free press clauses to the electronic media and to the changing impact of libel litigation upon all the media we are able to apply the Fourth Amendments prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to electronic surveillance we apply the commerce clause to state regulations of interstate trucking  From speech at the University of San Diego Law School Nov 25 1985 Libel Law    A freshening stream of libel actions which often seem as much designed to punish writers and publications as to recover damages for real injuries may threaten the public and constitutional interest in free and frequently rough discussion    The law of the First Amendment must not try to make public dispute safe and comfortable for all the participants That would only stifle the debate The American press is extraordinarily free and vigorous as it should be It should be not because it is free of inaccuracy oversimplification and bias but because the alternative to that freedom is worse than those failings Yet the area in which legal doctrine is currently least adequate to preserve press freedom is the area of defamation law      From concurring opinion in Ollman v Evans a 1984 court decision Homosexual Rights James L Dronenburg appeals from a district court decision upholding the United States Navys action administratively discharging him for homosexual conduct Appellant contends that the Navys policy of mandatory discharge for homosexual conduct violates his constitutional rights to privacy and equal protection of the laws The district court granted summary judgment for the Navy holding that private consensual homosexual conduct is not constitutionally protected We affirm    We would find it impossible to conclude that a right to homosexual conduct is fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty unless any and all private sexual behavior falls within those categories a conclusion we are unwilling to draw    If the revolution in sexual mores that appellant proclaims is in fact ever to arrive we think it must arrive through the moral choices of the people and their elected representatives not through the ukase of this court  From majority decision in Dronenburg v Zech a 1984 decision

The Senate's Right To Reject Nominees,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/opinion/the-senates-right-to-reject-nominees.html,LEAD Every President tries to shape the United States Supreme Court to realize his special constitutional vision Every President tries to shape the United States Supreme Court to realize his special constitutional vision The Constitution authorizes him and his oath virtually obliges him to do so And this is what President Reagan is trying to do by nominating Judge Robert H Bork for the Courts latest vacancy But the Constitution entitles the President only to try not necessarily to succeed The Framers divided the appointment power between the President and the Senate just as they divided the treaty power This sharing which in the late Senator Sam Ervins words made the Senates role    plainly equal to that of the President was one of the many hardfought compromises that made the Constitution possible Accordingly if a Senator thinks a nominee will undermine his conception of the Constitution the Senator has exactly the same right and duty as the President to protect his conception It is not just a question of whether the candidate had high grades in law school or is a good and honorable lawyer As Chief Justice William H Rehnquist said almost 30 years ago a candidates views of the equal protection and due process clauses are equally important That this is precisely what the Framers intended was made clear right from the start and by those who probably knew best  those present at the creation On June 29 1795 John Jay Chief Justice of the United States resigned to become Governor of New York President George Washington offered the Chief Justiceship to South Carolinas John Rutledge one of the most distinguished lawyers in America With a popular President behind him and a Federalist Senate confirmation should have been easy And it would have been but for one thing The controversial Jay Treaty with England had been ratified by the Senate just a few weeks earlier and support for the treaty had become a litmus test of true Federalism Mr Rutledge however had attacked the treaty Angry Federalist leaders urged the President to drop Mr Rutledge The President refused Nevertheless the Senate rejected the nominee 1410 Three of the 14 novotes were signers of the Constitution including Oliver Ellsworth a key figure at the Philadelphia convention familiarly known as the father of the Federal judiciary and a future Chief Justice himself He surely knew a Senators proper constitutional role The Rutledge episode is not unique The Senate has rejected almost 20 percent of Presidential Supreme Court nominees and an even higher proportion before 1900 Ideology and politics often played a role in these rejections In 1968 for example 19 Republican Senators including Howard H Baker Jr and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina declared they would vote against President Lyndon B Johnsons nomination of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice because Mr Johnson was in his final year of office and they thought a new President  a Republican they hoped  should be allowed to make that choice Equally important in the attack on Mr Fortas was his liberalism Conservatives like Sam Ervin of North Carolina Mr Thurmond John L McClellan of Arkansas and Everett M Dirksen of Illinois lambasted Mr Fortas for his views on law enforcement obscenity free speech capital punishment Federalism and many other issues They were constitutionally entitled to do so whether they acted wisely or not Constitutional experts of all persuasions agree with Prof Charles L Black Jr of Columbia Law School that in a world that knows that a mans social philosophy shapes his judicial behavior that philosophy is a factor in a mans fitness to be a judge Of some 27 rejections or withdrawals under fire more than onethird were for ideological reasons James Madisons nomination of Alexander Wolcott in 1811 was rejected 249 because Mr Wolcott was considered too partisan James Polks nomination of George Woodward in 1845 failed 2920 despite a 21month vacancy on the Court because of Mr Woodwards antiimmigrant attitudes Similarly several of Ulysses S Grants appointments were turned down for their views on such issues as civil service A nominees views on slavery were crucial in at least two instances In 1930 the Senate rejected Chief Judge John Parker of North Carolina because of antiunion rulings and antiblack remarks None of these failed candidacies was challenged for lack of professional or ethical qualifications In recent years however Senators have tended to overlook all but the most extreme ideological aberrations The very conservative Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day OConnor were virtually unopposed No one ever seriously thought that either threatened to subvert the Constitution The nomination of Judge Bork poses just such a threat however In almost every context  remedies for racial discrimination such as busing and affirmative action access to the courts abortion contraception womens rights state neutrality in religion protection for free expression constitutional protections for the accused  Judge Bork has condemned the Supreme Courts efforts His conception of the judicial function as controlled by the original intent of the Framers would keep the Constitution in knee breeches and livery President Reagan of course shares Judge Borks views and that is one powerful reason why he nominated Judge Bork Others however believe that this ideology threatens what Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr  whose retirement created the vacancy  called the irreplaceable value of judicial review in a democratic society Protection [for] the constitutional rights and liberties of individual citizens and minority groups Each Senator must decide independently whether confirming Judge Bork will preserve that irreplaceable value For two centuries Senators have consistently made such judgments and for good reason  the Constitution demands it

"IDEOLOGY AS COURT ISSUE; Democrats Pick Clear Battlefield on Bork, But Political Consequences Are Uncertain",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/us/ideology-court-issue-democrats-pick-clear-battlefield-bork-but-political.html,In choosing ideology as the battlefield for the confirmation of Robert H Bork Senate Democrats have expanded a highly charged contest over the direction of the Supreme Court into a fight with high stakes for the party as well The choice of a battleground is a departure from tradition with political consequences that may not become clear until the battle is over four or five months from now While the chances are that Judge Bork will eventually be confirmed the vehemently negative response from some key Democrats Wednesday was enough at least to raise the prospect of defeat either in the Judiciary Committee or through a filibuster if the nomination reaches the Senate floor Democrats in effect declared that in choosing Judge Bork President Reagan asked for an ideological fight and was going to get one Asked whether the Senate had the right to consider a Supreme Court nominees ideology Senator Robert C Byrd the majority leader replied Absolutely Formerly Sought Other Reasons The overall tone was in sharp contrast to last years unsuccessful attempt to block the elevation of Associate Justice William H Rehnquist to the position of Chief Justice Then many liberal Democrats went through contortions to deflect any appearance that they were opposing Justice Rehnquist because they didnt like his views A scattershot effort resulted its focus shifting from the restrictive covenant in the deed to Justice Rehnquists vacation home to his activities as a pollwatcher at Arizona voting places to his role in the Nixon Administration and his judicial ethics But if an ideological battle against Judge Bork promises more coherence it also carries dangers This is a battlefield that could prove slippery and full of land mines for a tenuous Senate majority that itself lacks ideological unity If the premise of the Senate debate is that the addition of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court will profoundly alter the course of constitutional law then the vote on the nomination inevitably becomes something much more than a vote on Robert Bork It becomes a referendum on the very issues that make senators most uncomfortable abortion affirmative action questions of church and state all the legislative genies that the Reagan revolution let out of the bottle in the early 1980s and that the Senate in the interest of getting on with its work has more or less managed in the last several years to bottle up once again Moreover this drama which may dominate the political landscape this fall as the Irancontra affair has since spring is unfolding at a critical point in the political cycle At stake in 1988 is not only the White House and the Senate majority but the personal political futures of some key players in the confirmation fight Of the eight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee two are running for President the chairman Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware and Paul Simon of Illinois If the Democrats take a partyline position of allout opposition to the nomination  a decision they have not yet made  there are political risks they will have to assess Mr Reagan could have made the Democrats lives considerably easier had he chosen a conservative nominee who lacked Judge Borks credentials But the choice of a prominent legal scholar whom the Senate confirmed unanimously to his current seat on the Federal appeals court here only five years ago presents the Democrats with the hardest case for departing from the tradition of examining only the competence and character of Supreme Court nominees Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who will be Judge Borks champion within the Judiciary Committee captured the Democrats dilemma when he warned them Wednesday that any effort to play politics with the nomination will wear thin with the public at large Judge Bork is just one of the best in the country whether you agree or disagree with his ideology Senator Hatch said adding I dont think the American people will put up with politics being played with something this important Some See a Case to Be Made On the other hand some Democrats believe that they can make a persuasive case to the same electorate that last November rejected Mr Reagans pleas to keep the Senate in Republican hands that it is not a question of playing politics but of keeping the Court from taking a rightward tilt that could outlive the Reagan Administration by many years Senators have recent evidence that the public looks with some care at how senators treat judicial nominations The lastminute switch by a Republican Senator Slade Gorton of Washington to provide the one vote the Administration needed to confirm Daniel K Manion to a Federal appeals court is widely credited with having cost Mr Gorton his Senate seat last fall Whatever the calculations for the party as a whole individual senators who need to keep their liberal credentials wellpolished have little choice about whether to oppose Judge Bork Even before the nomination was announced major civil rights organizations womens groups and abortion rights groups were ready with denunciations Judge Bork has been such an obvious Supreme Court choice for the Reagan Administration for so long that many of these groups already had extensive files of his legal writing and judicial opinions For Senator Biden who indicated in a newspaper interview last fall that he would probably vote in favor of a Bork nomination the only choice now appears to be how stridently to oppose the nomination His leeway was narrowed by the vituperative attack on Judge Bork that Senator Edward M Kennedy unleashed within moments of the nomination Senator Kennedy charged that Judge Bork favored segregation midnight raids by rogue police censorship at the whim of Government and shutting the courthouse doors on the fingers of millions of citizens Few senators may want to conduct the debate at that decibel level But the Massachusetts Democrat with his unquestioned liberal credentials set a standard against which liberal interest groups  a vital part of the Democratic constituency  are likely to measure all other senators words
U.S. AIDE TO FIGHT DISMISSAL IN ABORTION POLICY DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/04/us/us-aide-to-fight-dismissal-in-abortion-policy-dispute.html,A Federal official dismissed from her job for refusing to make grants to Planned Parenthood clinics said today that she would challenge her dismissal The official Jo Ann Gasper said in an interview that in resisting an order to make the grants she was trying to carry out the antiabortion policies of the Reagan Administration She was dismissed Thursday night by Dr Otis R Bowen the Secretary of Health and Human Services after she refused to carry out his instruction to renew two grants for the training of nurses at family planning clinics run by Planned Parenthood Mrs Gasper who was Deputy Assistant Secretary for population affairs said she regarded the order as improper and possibly illegal because Planned Parenthood was in her view an abortion advocacy organization Charles T Kline Jr a spokesman for Dr Bowen said the order was legally appropriate Gasper Described as Frustrated The Planned Parenthood Federation of America says it does not advocate abortion but defends it as an option legally available to pregnant women William W Hamilton Jr director of the federations Washington office said Mrs Gasper was frustrated because she has not been allowed to kill the program she was chosen to administer The dispute is the latest episode in a longrunning debate over abortion and the Governments family planning program established in 1970 under Title X of the Public Health Service Act The law provides money for family planning services but forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions For years the Government has not tried to stop clinics that receive Federal funds from performing abortions or providing abortionrelated services if such activities are financed with nonFederal funds and strictly separated from the clinics other work Mrs Gasper with the support of some White House officials had been trying to establish stricter rules that would have had the effect of denying Federal funds to the Planned Parenthood Federation and its affiliates Congress has strongly supported the family planning program and in reports accompanying annual appropriation laws has instructed Dr Bowen to refrain from making major changes in program rules Lawsuit or Complaint Considered Mrs Gasper said that after consulting lawyers she expected to challenge her dismissal either by filing a lawsuit against Dr Bowen or by filing a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board a Government agency that protects the rights of Federal employees Before renewing the two grants Mrs Gasper said she wanted to look into evidence of abortion advocacy by the recipients the national Planned Parenthood Federation and its Wisconsin affiliate Mr Kline the spokesman said Dr Bowen had told Mrs Gasper to renew the grants for 60 days while investigating the evidence She had previously resisted similar instructions from Dr Robert E Windom the Assistant Secretary who is in charge of the Public Health Service According to Mr Kline Dr Bowen opposes abortion and supports Congressional efforts to impose further restrictions on family planning clinics that receive Federal funds But he said Attorneys at the department told us that to impose such restrictions without a change in the law would be legally unsound Federal officials say 4000 clinics receive a total of 1425 million a year under the family planning program Of this amount they say Planned Parenthood and its affiliates typically receive 30 million An Ideological Problem Scott R Swirling executive director of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association which represents recipients of the Federal money said today We applaud Dr Bowen for firing an insubordinate underling who refused to follow the law We are pleased that Planned Parenthood affiliates will get the money to which they were entitled Dorothy Mann executive director of the Family Planning Council in Philadelphia which gets 25 million under the Federal program asserted that Mrs Gasper had an ideological problem with Planned Parenthood and did not seem to care that the victims of her actions were the patients we are supposed to serve Mrs Gasper said that Planned Parenthood clinics do a very slick and clever job of separating Federal dollars from private funds The Federal grants tend to strengthen their proabortion activities she added and abortion is antithetical to the purpose of Title X which is an antiabortion law In response Mr Hamilton the director of the Washington office of Planned Parenthood said We do what the law requires It says we may not use Federal funds for abortion and we very scrupulously segregate accounts to comply with the law Of the 750 clinics operated by affiliates of Planned Parenthood he said fewer than 50 perform abortions But he said all the clinics offer counseling that includes information about abortion as required by Federal guidelines for the program The dispute according to Mr Hamilton involved relatively small amounts of money 160000 for the Planned Parenthood Federation and 140000 for the Wisconsin affiliate

INTIMACY WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/intimacy-wasn-t-part-of-the-deal.html,HIGH COTTON Love and Death on Wall Street By Sherri Daley 304 pp New York W W Norton  Company 1895 I SLEPT with Rock Hudson I slept with Jack Kennedy My mother slept with Elvis Presley Having had sex with a now dead celebrity is such an acceptable route to fame why should anyone begrudge Sherri Daley her claim to glory I slept with Philip Hehmeyer The problem of course is that outside the narrow boundaries of his Southern highrolling fastliving crowd of commodities traders very few people will remember the 37yearold chairman of the New York Cotton Exchange who killed himself with a shotgun in his Upper East Side apartment after a bad day on the market five years ago But Hehmeyers relative anonymity would have posed no problem for a skeptical observer since the young mans life and death could arguably serve as a metaphor for all that has made Wall Street simultaneously the hot glamour industry and the junkyard of whitecollar crime Ms Daley is not quite that writer At one point she remembers And the red sun flattened out over the dull little meadow while I said Yes yes yes into his mouth and my world crashed into beautiful thrilling pieces Even here Ms Daleys soapopera sensibility could have worked if only she had remembered to play by the rules of glitz familiar to any casual reader of People magazine the celebrity must remain firmly at the center of the tale with the lovedoneleftbehind never forgetting that she is only a vehicle for bringing the reader a millimeter closer to fame to money to death Ms Daley refuses to take a back seat She admits that she started her book thinking that it was about Hehmeyer but soon discovered that the protagonist was Sherri Daley  a big blonde from Michigan naive gullible and eager When High Cotton opens she is 28 in a lowpaying secretarial job that her former lover a married man arranged for her Her hobby is needlepoint she quotes T S Eliot and Anais Nin when shes feeling philosophical She is a woman ready for action  love sex attention money Philip Hehmeyer an exotic fellow fits the bill The son of the manager of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra and a direct descendant of Francis Scott Key he came to New York in 1971 having served in Vietnam worked as a journalist in Memphis and managed a bar in St Thomas A man who made latenight phone calls to Nelson Bunker Hunt he had in less than two years made a million trading cotton He drank and wooed to excess drove a Jaguar and  hold on played the mandolin Hehmeyer and his friends were sexist and romantic Ms Daley tells us I loved it Fair enough but how are we to understand this love These are men who would get fallingdown drunk and then sneak up on people and pull down their bathing suits They would aim a fire hose into a friends apartment as a joke Or how about the hilarious fellow who kissed Ms Daleys hand and then tried to shove it down the front of his trousers It is true that the men paid for dinner drinks trips and taxis In return their girls kept quiet And if they were anything like Ms Daley they also opened the mens mail and paid their bills did their grocery shopping answered their phones and accepted social engagements for them did their laundry washed their windows and ironed their clothes When Hehmeyer and Ms Daley have a confrontation about his twotiming her she says Im not a part of your life or your family anymore I cant cook your dinners or pick up your shirts or clean your apartment What you get from me now you can get from your other women Whatever Hehmeyer got from Ms Daley  and vice versa  intimacy wasnt part of it She admits that they rarely spoke about anything personal even after sex We were uncomfortable with the intensity of our lovemaking and our feelings So we didnt talk about love we talked about money Their entire sexual relationship was likewise peculiar She would offer herself as a kind of home remedy for migraines and anxiety but she would stop short of orgasm so she could keep conscious of his smell and his touch and the sound of his voice AFTER a while these people this story take on an air of surrealism which is exacerbated by Ms Daleys memory for exactly who drank what when This is a remarkable feat considering that these are people who drank all the time martinis and dry vodka martinis vintage champagne cheap champagne Moet and Dom Perignon beer specifically Rolling Rock Bloody Marys and Bloody Bulls tequila brandy cognac and wine Pimms Cups mint juleps Southsiders and Surfsiders rum and cokes whisky and sodas They took roadies in the car kept bottles in their glove compartments and in a pinch while traveling turned to airport drinks It is perfectly clear that if Hehmeyer hadnt killed himself he would have killed himself if you know what I mean As he once said upon being handed a drink I feel life after death High Cotton also provides intimate access to a masochistic relationship  which is why perhaps Ms Daley was smart to shortchange Hehmeyer in favor of herself her story is sadly as emblematic of life in the 1980s as his is of the life of fast money She is a woman who found herself in unsatisfactory relationships with men too many times who couldnt climb out of stifling jobs who drank too much who turned to jogging for emotional solace who had an abortion she didnt want and who finally decided to have a baby with Hehmeyers best friend to the surprise of both men to replace the lovers she couldnt keep What is shocking is that Ms Daley can make her life only through others What is brave is that she admits it
WASHINGTON; Kennedy And Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html,Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts is urging the Democratic majority in the Senate to mount a major ideological attack on President Reagans nomination of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court But if theyre wise they wont follow him down this stormy path If he replaces Lewis F Powell on the Court Judge Bork might well cast the decisive vote against abortion affirmative action and churchstate issues No doubt Mr Reagan nominated him precisely for his conservative philosophy on these controversial issues Accordingly as the President had every right to choose a candidate of his own persuasion Mr Kennedy has the same ideological right to oppose him but the Senator has stated his case in such vehement terms that hes scaring the Democrats more than the Republicans Mr Kennedy asserted that Borks rigid ideology will tip the scales of justice against the kind of country America is and ought to be He said that Judge Borks firing of Archibald Cox as special prosecutor during the Watergate hearings was enough in itself to disqualify him for the Supreme Court and he added Robert Borks America is a land in which women would be forced into backalley abortions blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens This sounds to at least some of the candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination like an invitation not merely to reject Judge Bork but like an invitation to make the social issues a central part of the 1988 election campaign and they dont like it After their landslide defeats in the Presidential elections of 1980 and 1984 the Democrats have been trying to avoid the impression that they are merely a party of special interest groups  feminists blacks labor unions and other aggrieved minorities Accordingly even the liberal Democratic candidates are not interested in another charge of the light brigade In their recent debate with Bill Buckley in Houston they made clear that they were going to make a campaign issue out of President Reagans Star Wars program his support for the Nicaraguan contras his budget and trade policies his scandals and also what they regard as his indifference to the mounting problems of Mexican political and social unrest This is the formidable election agenda they have in mind Judge Borks views are clearly controversial but nobody questions his reputation as a legal scholar or forgets that he was confirmed unanimously to his present seat on the Federal Appeals Court in Washington just five years ago Mr Kennedy however having abandoned his own Presidential ambitions has increasingly emerged as the leading spokesman of the neglected people of the nation the poor the homeless the sick and the aged He is clearly troubled by the tendency in his own party to shift to the right under the influence of Ronald Reagans successful election tactics and hes arguing that if the candidates try to emulate Mr Reagan the voters will prefer honest Republican conservatives to bogus conservatives among the Democrats The chances are that his colleagues will follow him part way but not in the extreme language he has used so far They may even postpone the confirmation process until the autumn in order to concentrate on the Irancontra hearings with Colonel North Admiral Poindexter and Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger on the stand This will give the antiBork factions time to organize their arguments and their demonstrations and perhaps even keep the Court paralyzed with a fourfour lineup in the early days of the new term The Administration is trying to avoid this and is appealing for a decision on Judge Bork after the last days of Colonel Norths testimony and before the Congress rises for the summer recess If the Democratic leadership of the Senate refuses to cooperate and follows the Kennedy line the chances are that it will face public opposition divert attention from its main campaign issues and lose the fight over Judge Bork in the end Senator Kennedy cannot beat Judge Bork on the ideological issue alone Even his own brother insisted on an ideological appointment to the Court when he chose Arthur Goldberg a distinguished lawyer and darling of the unions
THE BATTLE OVER BORK; Senate Liberals Will Try to Block Nominee on Ideological Grounds,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/weekinreview/battle-over-bork-senate-liberals-will-try-block-nominee-ideological-grounds.html,WITH the direction of the Supreme Court the Reagan legacy and the Democratic Presidential nomination all in play the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork portends the biggest ideological battle of President Reagans second term It will also be the major test of modern times on an issue as old as the Republic Is the Senates advice and consent role a mandate to reject a Presidential nominee to the Court because it dislikes his ideology The recent tradition which the Administration says is rooted in the Constitution has been Senate acquiescence on judicial nominees who share the Presidents philosophy But liberals say the framers of the Constitution intended the Senate to play a coequal role otherwise they maintain it would be rubberstamping a Presidents effort to remake the law of the land  and to roll back constitutional protection of abortion rights through appointments to the Court The liberals are citing experience going back to the debates at the Constitutional Convention and the Senates rejection in 1795 of John Rutledge President Washingtons nominee to be Chief Justice largely because of the nominees opposition to the Jay Treaty with England In the two centuries following the Senate has rejected or forced the withdrawal of nearly 20 percent of presidential nominees to the Court Recent confirmation battles even the liberals attack on Justice William H Rehnquists elevation to Chief Justice have focused on allegations of personal misconduct and veracity But ideology was one key issue when President Johnson was forced to withdraw his nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968 The senators opposing him included Strom Thurmond of South Carolina now senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee who took the occasion to filibuster against the liberal jurisprudence of the Warren Court and Howard H Baker Jr now White House Chief of Staff Ideology has assumed such prominence in the battle over Judge Bork because his vote and intellectually muscular conservatism seem so likely to tilt the Court sharply to the right on such politically and emotionally charged issues as free speech affirmative action religion and most conspicuously abortion In many 5to4 decisions on these issues the man he would replace the moderatetoconservative Justice Lewis F Powell Jr had voted with the liberals Judge Borks eventual confirmation even by a Democraticcontrolled Senate seems probable though not assured But with Senate hearings unlikely before Labor Day and a final vote unlikely before the Courts new term begins the process promises to be one of long duration and unparalleled ferocity Liberal groups say their crusade to stop Judge Bork will be their major priority of the Reagan era They will be pressing senators who are seeking the Presidency especially Joseph R Biden Jr who as Judiciary Committee chairman will run the hearings President Reagan and his supporters on the right will push back with equal passion The Bork nomination represents a last best chance to advance Mr Reagans social agenda Genial and Tough At the center of the storm stands a big bearded genial man long a prominent critic of the judicial imperialism he ascribes to the modern activist liberal Supreme Court Most conspicuously Judge Bork has denounced the 1973 decision identifying a constitutional right to abortion and it seems clear he would provide the fifth vote to narrow and perhaps overrule that decision Liberal as well as conservative friends and associates praise Judge Bork as a deep thinker whose hardedged theories are devoid of bigotry and tempered by a ready wit who can enjoy a martini or a friendly debate with strong ideological adversaries He won the American Bar Associations highest rating when nominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the hunt for clouds on his integrity has been unavailing To his chagrin the 60yearold former Yale law professor has been known to the public chiefly as the Acting Attorney General who followed President Nixons order to dismiss Archibald Cox as the first Watergate special prosecutor in the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre While opponents have deplored his role in that episode some key participants say he acted honorably Bork supporters question why the Senate should be any more troubled now than it was when it confirmed him unanimously in 1982 His writings both as a scholar and as a judge clearly put him very far to the right on the spectrum of respectable legal thought The law of the land would be very different today if Judge Bork had been in charge over the last few decades He has denounced for example the one person one vote rulings of the 1960s and decisions striking down poll taxes and protecting the advocacy of overthrowing the government While public controversy has centered on Judge Borks denunciation of the abortion decision his position on that issue is far closer to the mainstream of legal scholarship than some of his other views He is assailed for what he terms deference to democratic choice his view that the judiciary should not override the social policy choices of elected officials by creating rights with no specific basis in the Constitutions language It is a measure of how deeply the institution of judicial review has taken root in America that elected senators are feeling so much pressure to reject a nominee whose philosophy rests on the premise that legislators should make the laws  Hell have a tough time getting confirmed but he is stunningly smart  Howard H Baker Jr White House Chief of Staff Robert Borks America is a land in which women would be forced into backalley abortions blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids     Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts I think he would be an outstanding member of the Court Bork deserves a lot of credit for standing up to Nixon and telling him to appoint another special prosecutor  Elliot L Richardson Former Attorney General The Court should not be a pendulum that swings back and forth depending on the ideology of the President  Senator Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois When you have a man of this caliber I think its just terrible to try and make an ideological battle out of it  Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah

"REAGAN HINTS AT BORK NOMINATION STRATEGY: STRESS CREDENTIALS, NOT VIEWS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/us/reagan-hints-at-bork-nomination-strategy-stress-credentials-not-views.html,In his first public statement on Judge Robert H Bork since nominating him for the Supreme Court President Reagan today signaled the Administrations strategy in the fight over the nomination to emphasize Judge Borks qualifications as a scholar and judge while sidestepping a confrontation over ideology Judge Borks views on Supreme Court decisions including those that established abortion as a constitutional right have prompted Democratic opponents to prepare to battle the nomination along ideological lines rather than on the narrower issue of his legal qualifications Five years ago the Senate unanimously confirmed Judge Bork to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit In his weekly radio address delivered from Camp David the President did not respond to criticism of Judge Borks philosophy or his role in the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973 when as Acting Attorney General Mr Bork dismissed the first Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox on President Nixons orders Instead Mr Reagan said that Judge Bork whom he nominated Wednesday is recognized by his colleagues and peers as a brilliant legal scholar and a fairminded jurist who believes his role is to interpret the law and not make it Quick Action Urged Judge Borks record indicates that if confirmed he would be likely to tip the Courts balance to the right on a wide range of issues including abortion the death penalty homosexual rights government aid to religous schools sexual harrassment of women Presidential power and possibly affirmative action Judge Bork would replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who was regarded as a moderate on the Court Justice Powell resigned late last month citing health problems Mr Reagan urged quick action on the nomination although Senate Democrats have said there will be an exhaustive examination of Judge Borks background To maintain the independence of the judiciary and I hope that we can keep politics out of the confirmation process and promptly schedule hearings the American people deserve a Supreme Court with nine justices operating at full strength Mr Reagan said Among the qualifications cited by Mr Reagan were Judge Borks experience as a Yale law professor and his record as a member of the Federal appeals court Thorough Review Predicted He has always heard each case with an open mind following the law and legal precedent not his personal preferences Mr Reagan said At arriving at a decision no appellate judge in America has a finer record Not a single one of his more than 100 majority opinions has ever been reversed by the Supreme Court A Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Patrick J Leahy of Vermont said in an interview after the Presidents speech that Mr Reagans nonconfrontational approach was politically wise but he expressed doubt that it would reduce Congressional demands for a thorough review of Judge Borks background and qualifications It doesnt change the the requirement for a real advise and consent review he said Senator Leahy who said he opposed delaying the confirmation hearings predicted that consideration of Judge Borks nomination would probably not commence before September The fall term of the Court begins Oct 5 The hearings should not be delayed for anything other than a thorough review Senator Leahy said In his address Mr Reagan discussed the importance of the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice This of course is serious business because the Court plays such a significant role in the preservation of our way of life and the protection of our liberty he said NAACP to Oppose Nomination By The Associated Press The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People will focus on how to defeat the Bork nomination at its 78th annual convention in New York this week the head of the civil rights group said This year we will especially focus on defeating Bork said the organizations executive director Benjamin L Hooks To replace a swing vote with a dyedinthewool conservative is unacceptable He would in effect wipe out all of our gains of the past 30 years In a telephone interview Friday Mr Hooks said the 10000 delegates expected for the sixday convention which officially opens Sunday night would discuss ways to defeat the nomination in the Senate Were trying to contact all the senators  some once some 10 or 12 times

LIMIT",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/us/the-talk-of-independence-mall-at-america-s-soapbox-free-speech-has-a-limit.html,Out on the grassy rectangle of Independence Mall this morning as long lines snaked toward the Liberty Bell pilgrims from near and far mounted what is called Americas Soapbox to deliver free opinions on anything under the summer sun One of the great things about America a mother told her very young son is that you can say anything you want Sometimes it would seem under some conditions And therein lay the days irony Nearby under the oak trees Richard Kanegis a stocky man with a beard carried a big sign Topped by two small American flags it read From the Magna Carta Through the Freedom of Informtion Act Protest Built a Precious Heritage Mr Kanegis is part of a group protesting American involvement in Central America some of whose members were prevented from carrying their protest onto Independence Mall during ceremonies May 25 for the bicentennial of the Constitution His only purpose today he said was to celebrate the right of protest itself and he was handing out copies of the Bill of Rights with forms attached for contributions to the American Civil Liberties Union Douglas Roe a United States Park Service ranger told him that Federal regulations required a permit for handing out leaflets and said that one could be obtained at the Independence National Historical Park office about four blocks away On second thought said the ranger he knew a faster way asked Mr Kanegis and a companion to wait and left Within 10 minutes another ranger W Patrick Bowman approached Advised that Mr Roe had asked Mr Kanegis and his companion to wait Mr Bowman replied Im his boss and told them to leave since they had no permit A witness Joey Perillo asked why the man could not hand out leaflets and make his statement next to the Liberty Bell on the Fourth of July Im not talking to you said Mr Bowman adding that he would arrest Mr Perillo for interference if he continued Mr Kanegis and his companion went to the Park Service office to get their permit It was locked The room was hushed as in a cathedral The faithful crowded in communicants in tanktops On the 211th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in the 200th year of the Constitution the pilgrims came from across the country to stand in the room at Independence Hall where Americas secular icons were created there to reaffirm faith attachment history hope And then quite suddenly the mood shifted and the pilgrims became everyday Americans again There was a stir Necks craned Cameras flashed Maude stand over here one of the visitors advised a friend you can see better The actor Patrick Duffy every bit as handsome as when he portrays Bobby Ewing on the primetime soap opera Dallas had arrived to take his place on the reviewing stand Mr Perillos job is to tend and monitor Americas Soapbox under the aegis of We the People 200 the group that is in charge of the bicentennial observance Every day he actively promotes free speech Today he climbed up on the box to denounce the incident between Mr Kanegis and the park rangers Not all topics at the soapbox are so highly charged One child for instance complained that he was tired of having my picture taken Another said he wished that bubblegum flavor would stay longer There is an occasional incoherent drunk and an occasional person who is a little off center Sometimes things get nasty On Friday a man spoke against abortion Many in the audience winced when he displayed a large color photograph of what he said was an aborted fetus and charged that the courts wont let me show this  In heated anger a man yelled Theres nobody stopping you from showing that picture Youre just the only one with the poor taste to show it Most people as on any holiday weekend are just having a good time The crowds are flocking to a seafood festival at Penns Landing on the Delaware river there to gulp down large quantities of crab cakes sushi clams and jambalaya They are attending nightly outdoor concerts and admiring fireworks displays Family groups posed before Independence Hall Mothers tried to keep children from running off One already frazzled before 1030 AM bowed her head and shook it slowly Friday night the visitors watched a parade that ended at Independence Hall some celebrants swinging their hips and shoulders in time to the martial music as if it were rock or disco At one point a small informal contingent wearing raccoon caps and Tshirts with the legend Woowoo paraded as the Philadelphia Order of Friendly Raccoons in honor of the late Jackie Gleasons fictional lodge In a far corner of Independence Mall a large family of visitors fed morsels of fat Philadelphia pretzels to the pigeons A few feet away on a bench sat one of the citys homeless street dwellers his bedroll by his side In a flat inaudible voice that seemed drained of all interest he said he was Charlie Little age 41 that he slept wherever I can roll out my bedroll What was he doing there today Just tryin to stay out of the way
BORK COULD TILT LAW AT ONCE IF SEATED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/06/us/bork-could-tilt-law-at-once-if-seated.html,An examination of cases pending before the Supreme Court suggests that Judge Robert H Bork could begin tilting the law to the right on key social issues as early as the Courts fall term On the other hand rejection of President Reagans nominee by the Senate or a delay in the final vote for weeks or months after the Court begins hearing arguments Oct 5 could lead to 4to4 deadlocks in some key cases postponing the resolution of legal conflicts among lower courts The Court has already agreed to hear in its coming term cases involving abortion religion the death penalty gay rights free speech job bias and other politically charged issues Abortion Case From Illinois Judge Bork long a leading conservative legal theorist and trenchant critic of the Courts activist liberal decisions is considered likely to move the balance to the right on many of these issues He was nominated on July 1 by President Reagan to replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr the pragmatic centrist who retired the previous week citing health problems Justice Powell often sided with the Courts liberals on key issues including abortion The absence of Justice Powell for two months in early 1985 for health reasons resulted in 4to4 deadlocks in eight of the cases argued while he was gone A deadlock affirms the ruling of the lower court but sets no precedent The abortion case the Court has agreed to hear this fall is an appeal by Illinois of a decision striking down a state law restricting minors access to abortions It comes at a time when four of the Courts current members have made it clear that they want to narrow or overrule the Courts protection of abortion rights Judge Bork who has denounced as unconstitutional the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion would give them a fifth vote But it is unclear whether the Court would consider the narrow issue in the Illinois case an appropriate vehicle for a broad reevaluation of its abortion precedents Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 Two ChurchState Cases Another major case involves a Federal district court decision striking down part of a 1981 Federal law designed to discourage adolescent sexual activity The lower court invalidated the law because it granted money to Roman Catholic charities and other religious organizations for such activities as teaching the virtues of chastity While the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear that case Bowen v Kendrick it is considered likely to do so The Reagan Administration notified the Court Thursday that it would appeal the district courts ruling that the law unconstitutionally established religion Judge Borks vote could well be decisive The issue is closely related to the constitutionality of government aid to religious schools The Court voted 5 to 4 to strike down two such programs in 1985 with Justice Powell in the majority Judge Bork who has advocated deference to legislative policies that do not violate specific constitutional language is considered more likely to uphold the validity of such programs Another churchstate case which the Court has agreed to hear involves the constitutionality of a 1982 New Jersey law requiring that public schools permit students to observe one minute of silence daily for quiet and private contemplation and introspection Appeal From Young Murderer The case could be a major test of the constitutionality of such moment of silence laws which have been adopted at one time or another in about 25 states including New York and Connecticut A Federal appeals court voted 2to1 to strike down the New Jersey law as an unconstitutional establishment of religion saying it had a thinly disguised purpose of facilitating prayer Karcher v May No 851551 Among the death penalty cases the Court has agreed to hear is one in which the question is whether states may execute convicted murderers who were under 18 years old when they committed their crimes The case Thompson v Oklahoma No 866169 is an appeal by an Oklahoma death row inmate who was sentenced to death for a brutal murder in 1983 when he was 15 Dismissal of Homosexual Justice Powell sometimes gave death row defendants 5to4 victories by upholding arguments against certain applications of the death penalty Judge Bork who has stressed that the Constitutions specific words recognize no distinction between the death penalty and other sentences is considered less likely to do so The homosexual rights issue before the Court is posed by an appeal by the Central Intelligence Agency of a suit by a former employee who was dismissed despite an excellent service record on the ground that his homosexuality posed a security risk A Federal appeals court had ordered further proceedings in the case saying that the agency might have violated the mans constitutional rights if it had dismissed him solely for his homosexual orientation as opposed to homosexual conduct The Administration argued in its appeal Webster v Doe No 861294 that the courts have no authority to secondguess decisions by the CIA to dismiss employees no matter what the reason Trio of Free Speech Cases Judge Bork held in a broadly worded 1984 Federal appeals court decision that the Constitution provides no protection for private consensual homosexual conduct and upheld the discharge of a Navy man for such conduct He has also been generally receptive to arguments for restricting judicial review of government actions The Court has agreed to hear a trio of significant free speech cases and could be closely divided in at least two In Hazelwood School District v Kuhlmeier No 86836 the Court has agreed to review a Federal appellate ruling that a principals censorship of studentwritten articles in a high school school newspaper about teenage sex and pregnancy violated the First Amendment The case could set an important precedent on the constitutional rights of high school students In Virginia v American Booksellers Association No 861034 the Court will hear Virginias appeal of a decision striking down a 1985 state law that banned the unrestricted display of sexually explicit books and magazines The case could affect laws in 48 other states that regulate the display of materials deemed harmful to minors In Hustler v Falwell No 861278 the Court will hear Hustler Magazines appeal of 200000 award to the Rev Jerry Falwell for its intentional infliction of emotional distress by publishing a parody that depicted the television evangelist as an incestuous drunk Press groups have expressed concern that the lower court decision could set a dangerous precedent threatening those who engage in sharp but not libelous criticism of public figures Evidence of Discrimination These groups might be heartenened by Judge Borks concurring opinion in a 1984 Federal appellate ruling in a libel case He called for energetic judicial efforts to preserve press freedom in the area of defamation law including the freedom to publish wounding assessments of public figures But Judge Bork has also assailed the Courts decisions protecting sexually explicit speech and he argued in a 1971 article from which he has more recently backed away somewhat that only explicitly political speech is protected by the Constitution In a civil rights case the Court will decide whether a lower court erred in dismissing a suit by white New York City police officers who said they had been denied promotions to sergeant because of discrimination resulting from a courtapproved settlement of a civil rights suit brought by black and Hispanic candidates Marino v Ortiz No 861415 Mr Bork has questioned the legality of affirmative action preferences for members of minority groups and civil rights groups fear he will generally side with the Administration and against them on such issues
HOW TO JUDGE JUDGE BORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/07/opinion/how-to-judge-judge-bork.html,Americans hold the Supreme Court in such reverence that they are sometimes persuaded haplessly to try taking the politics out of politics As President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Court reverberates it becomes clear that this is such a time The white marble and black robes radiate a virtue that transcends partisanship Thats exactly as it should be Federal judges receive lifetime appointments in order to be free of any partisan debt or duty Their unencumbered freedom to decide cases is however distinctly different from how the Senate should decide which nominees to approve for the Court As the history of Reagan nominations illustrates that is a political question properly and always To claim that it is improper to examine a nominees philosophical positions misses the point The wholly proper test is to discover and weigh what those positions are Ronald Reagan pledged to change the Supreme Courts philosophy At his early heights of popularity he filled his first vacancy with Sandra Day OConnor the first woman Justice Nominated just six years ago today she sailed through three days of hearings and was confirmed a week before the Courts fall term unanimously Mr Reagan won in 1984 by a landslide but the 1986 elevation of William Rehnquist to Chief Justice met increased resistance from a Republican Senate even though the companion appointment of Antonin Scalia brought little net change in the Courts outlook This time there were four days of quarrelsome hearings and the Senate eventually approved the promotion only by a vote of 65 to 33 seven more negative votes than any justice in history had received Now the politics have changed dramatically The Senate is controlled by the Democrats The Presidents popularity has plummeted And Judge Borks extensive record as a lawyer teacher government official and member of the Court of Appeals strongly suggests that he would change the Courts delicate balance Is that a legitimate focus of concern Yes philosophy is every bit as relevant for the Senate as for the President who nominated him For people who think of themselves as progressive on social issues that record is not reassuring Senators may legitimately try to elicit whether his hostility to the 1973 abortion decision will influence Judge Bork to vote to overturn it More particularly the Senate may inquire whether related decisions are in jeopardy One is the 1965 ruling that Connecticuts ban on contraceptives was unconstitutional as applied to married couples That decision set forth principles of privacy and personal liberty that Judge Bork has criticized because he cant find them in the text of the Constitution Of high interest also is how much the nominees views about free speech and press have changed In 1971 he wrote that the First Amendment protected primarily political speech from Government suppression What kind of a country would this be if artistic expression were held to lack Bill of Rights safeguards Justice Rehnquist was alone just two years ago in arguing that the ban on establishing religion prevents only one thing government sponsorship of a church Now Justice Scalia announces his agreement  and Robert Bork might thus provide a third vote to overturn numerous decisions against statesponsored school prayer The current controversy over independent prosecutors to investigate the Reagan Administration magnifies questions about Robert Borks dismissal of the special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973 He carried out President Nixons order despite Justice Department rules that had the force of law Judge Bork later explained that he was free to carry out the order because only his superiors had personally promised not to do such a thing absent extraordinary improprieties Are executive officials thus free to ignore commitments of law and honor These and other questions warrant full Senate attention Questions that might have been answered one way in 1973 or even 1986 may be answered differently this year The Courts balance is different the Senate is different the politics are different
The Editorial Notebook; Who's Responsible for 'Safe Sex'?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/08/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-who-s-responsible-for-safe-sex.html,Saatchi  Saatchi DFS Compton the advertising agency recently unveiled three television commercials it made for the New York City Health Department promoting use of condoms to limit AIDS One shows a woman handing a package of condoms to her daughter with the words If youre doing anything you use one of these You understand Cause my baby is not getting AIDS The second shows a woman putting on makeup then dropping a condom in her purse In the third a couple is kissing The female hands the male a condom He hands it back An announcer says And if he says no so can you The frankness of the ads set off a storm So did their unabashed appeal to women Some women expressed outrage that they who have always borne the burden for contraception are now expected to bear the burden for AIDS prevention as well Asked why Charles Abrams a Saatchi executive replied Theyre accustomed to taking charge of their lives Thats right they are and for a very good reason Although insemination takes two sexes only one sex gets pregnant bears children and undergoes abortions And women are at risk of getting AIDS from men who turn out to be bisexual or intravenous drug users infected with the virus Femaletomale transmission is much rarer Women are accustomed to talking to their doctors about contraception but talking to a partner about condom use is more complicated A woman writing in Vogue surely finds it so Getting a man to wear a condom isnt as simple as saying You look better in a hat  she notes and promptly goes condomshopping Her efforts to get partners to accept her offerings  she is always it seems buying the wrong brand  are recounted with increasing hilarity Why is this woman laughing And why dont men get their own condoms They are not about to as long as women do it for them Women buy as many as 70 percent of the condoms sold in this country And commercials like those prepared by Saatchi only reinforce mens reluctance to take responsibility for their sex lives Although millions of New Yorkers are familiar with the Health Department commercials they wont be widely aired Only one television station owned by the city has agreed to carry all three Now Mayor Koch has ordered another less controversial campaign directed at adolescents This one will stress abstinence and probably wont upset anyone Abstinence should be encouraged but so should use of condoms  even at risk of offending those politicians and religious leaders who objected to the Saatchi commercials Theres a way though to avoid gratuitously offending women Put the emphasis for prevention of AIDS where it belongs On men too

"ABORTION, BORK AND THE '88 CAMPAIGN",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/08/us/abortion-bork-and-the-88-campaign.html,President Reagans nomination of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court is pushing the abortion issue back to the center stage of American politics by threatening to unsettle what has been an uneasy truce on the question for the last decade The nomination could also substantially alter the course of the 1988 campaign political strategists say The de facto truce on abortion resulted from a balance of political power between supporters and opponents of legalized abortion Abortion foes have failed over many years to secure backing for a constitutional amendment to ban the practice proponents of abortion rights have failed to obtain Federal financing of abortion for poor women Judge Borks nomination however raises the prospect of sudden changes in the nations law on the subject He has made clear that he believes the Supreme Court erred in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision striking down state laws against abortion May Spur Rights Movement Ann F Lewis a prominent Washington Democrat said that the nomination has already galvanized the abortion rights movement Reagans nomination of Bork may succeed in doing what the prochoice movement has been unable to do said Ms Lewis who works closely with the groups favoring abortion rights That is to convince the American people that the right to a safe legal abortion can be put in jeopardy by the political process John Buckley a veteran of conservative political campaigns who is press secretary to Representative Jack F Kemp the New York Republican said that the Roe v Wade decision had turned the righttolife movement into one of the driving forces in the Republican Party for 15 years A court decision narrowing or overturning Roe v Wade he said could have a similar effect on the political power of the abortion rights movement giving it renewed energy But Mr Buckley added Conservatives would gladly hand over the momentum if it means an end to abortion According to the Guttmacher Institute a nonprofit research organization 1588550 abortions were reported in the United States in 1985 Of those 554 were federally financed Virtually all Federal financing for abortion was eliminated in 1977 although some states still pay for the operation Former President Jimmy Carter like many moderate Democrats favored legal abortion but opposed Federal financing of abortions for poor women For its supporters this stance had the virtue of keeping the Government out of the issue entirely And they argue that the price of an abortion is within the reach of most women The Guttmacher Institute said that abortions in the first three months of pregnancy cost about 200 when hospitalization is not required A Potentially Decisive Battle Those on both sides of the abortion issue see the battle over Judge Bork as potentially decisive because he could be part of a new court majority that would return the abortion issue to states The most likely result of this they said would be the patchwork pattern that applied before Roe v Wade decision when some states permitted abortion and others banned it Prof James Hitchcock of St Louis University said Judge Borks nomination had largely vindicated the faith of one wing of the antiabortion movement in political action and in the Reagan Administration Were within striking distance of something that might have seemed impossible a few years ago said Professor Hitchcock a history teacher who has long been a foe of abortion From time to time there has been a frustration in the righttolife movement with the Reagan Administration a feeling that the President was unwilling to twist enough arms in Congress on the issue Professor Hitchcock said But many people who had analyzed the situation carefully now appear to have been right in thinking that ultimately this would be resolved through the judiciary This he said was not surprising since the advocates of abortion rights also won their major victories through the courts Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said that the nomination had shifted the debate back to the centrality of a womans right to an abortion after years in which the focus was more narrowily on the issue of Federal financing for abortions Key Role Seen in 88 Race She said it now seemed inevitable that abortion would play a key role in the 1988 campaign The landscape has changed Ms Michelman said Thats what these candidates are going to have to deal with now Ms Lewis said the unanimous criticism of Judge Bork from the Democratic Presidential candidates suggested that many social issues  notably civil rights  that had once been litmus tests for candidates had become fundamental principles for the party But this has not been the case with the abortion issue which is far more complicated politically and cuts across partisan lines While all the Democratic Presidential candidates oppose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion for example several also oppose Federal financing for abortions reflecting what Ms Lewis called a certain ambivalence in public opinion on the question Moreover many Democrats particularly liberal Catholics like Governor Cuomo of New York have invoked the Roe v Wade decision to justify their support for abortion rights even though they declared themslves personally opposed to the practice Careful Rationale Threatened Governor Cuomo and others have said they feel bound to uphold the law as defined by the Supreme Court By threatening to overturn the decision on which this argument is based Judge Borks nomination also threatens to upset this carefully developed political stance Some politicians see the political impact of the nomination as even broader since the battle over Judge Bork will highlight important differences between Republicans and Democrats on issues ranging from separation of church and state to racial preferences in employment as well as on abortion Democrats fear that this could be a boon to the Republicans since such social issues have been a driving force behind the substantial defections to the Republicans since 1968 Democratic losses motivated at least in part by the social issues have been pronounced among bluecollar voters poor Southern whites and Roman Catholics Up to now the Democratic Presidential candidates have been largely successful in appearing moderate on such matters by speaking often in the language of family and community or by hardly talking about them at all Instead they have tried to focus attention on economic issues education child welfare and Mr Reagans performance on the job These are all issues the Democrats regard as electionwinners and a shift of attention back to the social issues could imperil this strategy New Attention on Social Issues But the nomination could cut against the Republicans too Both Ms Lewis and Mr Buckley noted that a key reason for Mr Reagans success was his ability to win votes from those who shared his conservative views on economic matters but disagreed with him on the social issues This was especially true on abortion where the lack of any change in the status quo in Mr Reagans first term reassured many abortion rights supporters that there would be no change in Mr Reagans second term either Polls in both 1980 and 1984 showed Mr Reagan winning substantial support from voters notably among the welloff and the young who disagreed with him on abortion Now that Mr Reagan has shown through his court appointments that he meant what he said all along on abortion and other social matters Ms Michelman predicted that many of these voters would have second thoughts about their Republican allegiances
Poll Hints at Bork Support,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/08/us/poll-hints-at-bork-support.html,Fortynine percent of all Americans believe that a nominee to the Supreme Court should be confirmed by the Senate even though some senators disagree with his ideology according to a poll for US News  World Report The telephone survey of 1010 people was conducted June 30 and July 1 just before President Reagan nominated of Judge Robert H Bork to replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr on the Supreme Court The poll conducted by the Roper Organization found that 35 percent polled believed that the Senate should reject a nominee for ideological reasons The survey which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points indicated that even people who would approve of such a confirmation were not entirely in sympathy with all of Judge Borks ideas For example 41 percent favored a nominee who would continue the Courts present position of legalized abortion while 38 percent wanted a nominee who would support abortion only when the mothers life is endangered or when the pregnancy is caused by rape or incest Sixteen percent wanted the nominess to outlaw all abortions More than 37 percent of those responding to the poll said the Presidents appointee should maintain the ideological balance of the Court as it was before Justices Powells retirement Thirtytwo percent said the next Justice should make the High Court more conservative 20 percent wanted the Court to become more liberal
BIDEN VOWS TO LEAD FORCES AGAINST BORK'S CONFIRMATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/us/biden-vows-to-lead-forces-against-bork-s-confirmation.html,Senator Joseph R Biden Jr chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a Democratic Presidential contender assured opponents of the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork today that he would lead the fight against his confirmation to the United States Supreme Court The remarks were made at a private meeting this morning called by Mr Biden to convey his position to leaders of civil rights groups who are marshaling for an allout battle to defeat the nomination Pete Smith a spokesman for the Judiciary Committee confirmed that Senator Biden intends to oppose the nomination and to lead the effort against it in the Senate But the spokesman said the Delaware Senator does not plan to formally announce his opposition until he has a chance to spell out his reasons in detail in a series of speeches which he plans to begin next week Hearings Set for Sept 15 The Judicary Committee has jurisdiction over judicial nominations and today Mr Biden announced that hearings on the nomination would not begin until Sept 15 almost assuring that the Court will have a vacancy when the next term begins on Oct 5 When told of the decision not to begin hearings until September Marlin Fitzwater the White House spokesman said We hope they will reconsider because we would sure like to start the new term with a full Court Mr Bidens assurances that he will oppose the nomination represented an important shift by the powerful liberal Democrat that could add to pressures on uncommitted Senators Presidential candidates and other prominent Democrats to take early positions on the Bork nomination In the past Mr Biden has sought to avoid a politically and ideologically partisan approach to judicial nominations Some liberal and civil rights groups say that stopping Judge Borks nomination will be their major priority of the Reagan era Judge Bork who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is known to have conservative positions on such issues as abortion capital punishment and government aid to religious schools It has been widely assumed that if seated he could tip the balance of the Supreme Court to the right for years to come A civil rights official who attended the meeting today and spoke on the condition that he not be identified said of Mr Biden He made it very clear to us that he knows what hes going to do and that he considers the confirmation fight so important that hes willing to work on this and not on the Presidential campaign According to Congressional sources among those attending todays meeting with Senator Biden were Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Judith L Lichtman of the Womens Legal Defense Fund Elaine Jones a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee also said today that hearings on Judge Borks nomination would not begin until Sept 15 Mr Biden speaking at a news conference promised a full and thorough and fair review of the qualifications of Judge Bork Biggest Nomination in Years This is probably the most significant Supreme Court nomination in the last several decades and arguably in this century Mr Biden said But for all the talk of openmindedness Mr Biden left little doubt about where he stood on the nomination At stake Mr Biden said was whether the Reagan Administrations agenda would be accomplished through the Court and whether Judge Bork had been picked to accomplish it according to accounts of those at the meeting The announcement that the confirmation hearings are not to begin until after the August Congressional recess drew an immediate protest from committee Republicans who have been pushing for a final vote on the nomination before the new term begins Thurmond Said to Be Angry Mark Goodin a spokesman for Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee said the Senator feels very strongly about getting a written agreement from the Democrats that spells out dates and deadlines for everything not only the beginning and end but a reasonable timecertain for a full committee vote Mr Goodin added that Mr Thurmond would take a very dim view of any tactic that keep the nomination from the floor until mid to late October The Senator he said has requested a meeting with Mr Biden Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the Democratic leader and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader to set firm dates for Senate consideration of the nomination regardless of any schedule announced today by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee Mr Biden said in the news conference that he met earlier in the day with Judge Bork to assure him any witnesses he wants on his behalf will be allowed to testify before the Judiciary Committee Criticism Over Rehnquist The Senator said it will take about two weeks to complete the hearings and there was no scheduled date for the committee to vote on the nomination In the past civil rights officials and others have criticized Mr Biden for not taking what they considered an aggressive enough posture in opposing the nomination of Justice William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States although the Senator voted against Mr Rehnquist Civil rights officials have also criticized Mr Biden for saying in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer last November that if a wellqualified conservative like Judge Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court Id have to vote for him and if the groups tear me apart thats the medicine Ill have to take Seemed to Modify Posture He added at the time That kind of vote may turn out to be a liability for the Presidential nomination process but it would happen whether or not I was chairman Mr Biden backed away from these statements in a June 28 television interview saying that he had made those comments only in the context of Bork replacing a conservative He added that while Judge Bork was a brilliant man that did not mean that there should be six or seven or eight or even nine Borks on the Court Meanwhile Judge Bork has just written a check to the City of New Haven for more than 1000 in back taxes and accrued interest his accountant George B Allen said today The taxes were assessed on two cars he had registered in New Haven in 1972 and 1973 while he was a professor at the Yale Law School Connecticut authorizes local communities to tax motor vehicles as personal property He subsequently moved to Washington and was not aware that he owed the money until he received a recent notice according to Mr Allen He is not even sure that the bills are correct but he has written out a check for the full amount and sent it off the accountant said The city records showed that Judge Bork owed 43779 in taxes and 57193 in interest for a 1972 Buick station wagon and a 1968 Volvo according to a report in The New Haven Register
"WASHINGTON TALK: THE BORK NOMINATION; IN NO TIME AT ALL, BOTH PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS ARE READY FOR BATTLE  Foes on the Left Strive for Unity",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/us/washington-talk-bork-nomination-no-time-all-both-proponents-opponents-are-ready.html,By the time President Reagan went before the television cameras last week to announce his choice for the Supreme Court the campaign to persuade the Senate not to confirm Robert H Bork was already well under way This reversal of the usual pattern of events in which the President acts and the various affected groups react reflected the sense of emergency that the Supreme Court vacancy created almost instantly throughout the countrys extensive network of civil rights and civil liberties groups It was not that liberal organizations far outside the Reagan Administrations orbit had received advance word of Judge Borks selection which finally came last Wednesday It was something more intuitive a kind of metaphysical shudder that ran through the liberal community as soon as Justice Lewis F Powell Jr widely viewed as a moderate buffer against conservative dominance on the Court announced his retirement on the morning of June 26 Activists Had Kept Files Throughout the network it had long been assumed that the Administrations next Supreme Court appointment would go to Judge Bork the countrys most prominent conservative judge As was evident from the wealth of detail that poured forth in those first few days after Justice Powell retired  quotations from longago Congressional testimony and 20yearold magazine articles civil rights activists had been keeping files on Judge Bork in anticipation of this moment There was a strategy to the activity of those first few days said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights The conference a 37yearold coalition of 185 civil rights groups has played a leading role in legislative battles throughout the Reagan era It instantly became the center of gravity for the antiBork campaign convening strategy sessions attended by representatives of dozens of groups Mr Neas said there were two immediate goals One was to let the White House and the Senate know that the choice of Judge Bork would guarantee a bitter struggle over confirmation To that end civil rights leaders put out statements promising virtually united opposition to a Bork nomination Once the nomination was announced last Wednesday Mr Neas and Benjamin L Hooks the chairman of the Leadership Conference who also serves as executive director of the NAACP put out a statement that suggested without saying explicitly that the confirmation vote would be the ultimate litmus test for any senator seeking credibility with civil rights groups Historic Moment This is the most historic moment of the Reagan Presidency their statement said Senators will never cast a more important and far reaching vote The second goal was to communicate to the public the view that the civil rights achievements of the last 30 years as Mr Neas said countless times in the last 10 days were at stake in the appointment It was crucial to convey a sense of urgency he said We had to be on top of it so everyone would have the same information at the start that this man is far to the right of Lewis Powell Mr Neas said he was pleased with the results of the initial effort The President usually has a tremendous advantage he said Were brought in responding and reacting in the last paragraph This was one of the rare times our side was heard fairly and comprehensively at the moment the President made something happen The key players in the antiBork effort form a kind of interlocking directorate of groups that have cooperated on many battles over the years In the week since the appointment was announced the groups have been working on strategies to call on individual strengths People for the American Way for example is known for its strong mailing lists the National Abortion Rights Action League for its grassroots organization the Alliance for Justice for its research capacity A key part of the strategy is to make the case both to the public and to the Senate that it is entirely proper for the Senate to take ideology into account in considering whether to confirm a Supreme Court nominee As soon as the nomination was announced an organization called the Judicial Selection Project prepared a threepage memorandum for use by editorial page writers It contained historical material and quotations from prominent scholars both liberal and conservative supporting the view that the Senate should consider ideology The Judicial Selection Project supported by a broad array of civil rights groups was set up in early 1985 to monitor the judicial appointments of the second Reagan Administration Were the respository said Nan Aron the head of the project But the projects distribution network is limited so People for the American Way a 250000member group that describes itself as a nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization sent the memorandum along with one of its own to editorial writers at nearly 1700 newspapers Absent from the campaign so far has been the American Civil Liberties Union which has a 50yearold bylaw prohibiting involvement in judicial or executive branch confirmation or in political campaigns But that policy was suspended once before so as to oppose President Nixons nomination of William H Rehnquist to the Court and there is pressure within the organization to suspend it once again Frank Askin a former ACLU general counsel now on the organizations board has requested an emergency meeting of the executive committee Can we really afford to sit back and watch Ronald Reagan scuttle the right of reproductive freedom and affirmative action and do nothing in the name of nonpartisanship he wrote to fellow board members The nomination has coincided with the annual meetings of several organizations that will take an active part in the campaign AntiBork oratory was a centerpiece of conventions this week of both the NAACP and the National Education Association The National Abortion Rights Action League has restructured its convention starting here this Friday to focus on the Court fight It had long planned to give a special leadership award to Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon this week he became the only Republican to announce his opposition to the nomination Looking Beyond the Committee The fate of the Bork nomination depends on moderate Republicans like Mr Packwood as well as on conservative Democrats like Howell Heflin of Alabama and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona two who hold the balance on the Judiciary Committee But virtually every organization is looking beyond the committee on the assumption that the outcome will eventually be decided on the Senate floor probably late this year The opponents believe that to the extent that senators and their constituents understand the stakes the nomination can be defeated In any event there is no chance that the antiBork campaign will run out of energy This is about what people have worked their whole lives for Mr Neas said
NOW HEAD CRITICIZES DEMOCRATS AS BEING ALOOF ON WOMEN'S ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/us/now-head-criticizes-democrats-as-being-aloof-on-women-s-issues.html,Eleanor C Smeal the departing president of the National Organization for Women today assailed what she described as conventional wisdom that Democrats should be cautious keep womens issues at arms length and move toward the right for the 1988 Presidential election In a speech to the National Press Club Ms Smeal asserted that it was time for feminists not to beg others to do the right thing but to run for office themselves in large numbers I say this time we go out there ourselves from the top to the bottom  flood the ticket said Ms Smeal who disclosed last week that she would not seek reelection as president of NOW We Do Mean Business Feminists dont mean business as usual but we do mean business she added outlining her plans for a feminization of power campaign to spur more women to run for office Ms Smeal argued that the 1988 election would be similar to the postWatergate election of 1974 and would witness sweeping changes in Congress Of the new faces in Congress in 1989 Ms Smeal declared I want at least half of them to be women She also expressed support for Representative Patricia Schroeder the Colorado Democrat who is considering a race for the Presidency She said that Ms Schroeder would address the annual convention of NOW to be held July 1719 in Philadelphia As was the case at its 1986 convention the group chose not to invite any of the other Democratic Presidential hopefuls The organization gave an early endorsement to Walter F Mondale in the 1984 campaign but until now it has maintained a distance from the 1988 nominating process Ms Smeal called on Congress to begin investigating the possibility of impeachment proceedings against President Reagan saying she disagreed with the notion that Mr Reagan should be allowed to quietly finish out his term Gender Gap Invoked She warned Democratic Senators that women expected them to oppose the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H Bork who has made it clear that he believes the Supreme Court erred in its 1973 decision legalizing abortion We elected them in 1986 by a gender gap a gender gap of women who want the right to choose Ms Smeal said of the Democratic Senate She was also critical of the Democratic Leadership Council an independent group of elected officials mostly from the South and West In its agenda for the 1988 election Ms Smeal said the group had nothing to say about abortion Al From the groups executive director said the agenda was not designed to cover every issue Ms Smeal argued that the womens movement was increasingly the scapegoat for a host of societal ills She cited the recent comments of Gen P X Kelley the recently retired Marine commandant who said that the nations moral fiber was being weakened by among other things the fact that many children are not getting the kind of upbringing in their home that you and I had Rather he said their moral upbringing is being dictated by some nameless faceless child care center Ms Smeal argued that the only way most middleclass families were able to stay in the middle class was because of working women
Abortion Aid Cutoff Is Blocked,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/11/us/abortion-aid-cutoff-is-blocked.html,The state Court of Appeals issued an order today that blocked at least temporarily a new law cutting off Medicaid payments for abortions The payments were suspended after Judge Robert Holmes Bell of the Ingham County Circuit Court ruled June 30 that the state did not have to wait until next spring to put the new law into effect The action means the state Department of Social Services which administers the Federal Medicaid program in Michigan can begin reimbursing doctors hospitals and clinics for abortions for poor women Im so happy said Renee Dickens of Summit Medical Center in Detroit It shows you cannot deny people access to certain services because of income level At our center weve been seeing Medicaid patients anyway at a very much reduced fee But some people cant even come up with 50 to 75 she said Barbara Listing president of Right to Life of Michigan said Were happy that the state at least was out of the abortion business for nine days Her group initiated the new law with a petition drive The appelate court issued the order blocking the new law pending a decision by a threejudge panel on an appeal of Judge Bells ruling The panel agreed to hear the appeal quickly William Perrone the attorney for Right to Life of Michigan said he planned to file briefs with the appeals court on Monday We want to move as soon as we can he said We expect that there will be a hearing set up in seven to 10 days The new law restricts payments for abortions under the Medicaid program except when the life of the mother is at risk
Democrats and Women: Party Shifts Approach,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/11/us/democrats-and-women-party-shifts-approach.html,Three years into the postFerraro era of Democratic politics the partys Presidential candidates are campaigning for womens votes in a manner that has aroused debate and complaints from some women that feminism is being neglected The approach of the 1988 Democratic candidates in seeking womens votes is markedly different from that of the candidates of 1984 according to a number of Democratic strategists politicians and feminists The shift in approach has prompted charges from many women that the Democratic candidates are neglecting their votes and their issues a point made forcefully this week by Eleanor C Smeal the departing president of the National Organization for Women Representative Patricia Schroeder the Colorado Democrat who is pondering her own race for the Presidential nomination agrees There seems to be WashingtonPotomac wisdom that they did women last time But other women argue that the Democratic campaigns are demonstrating a new subtlety and sophistication recognizing that voting women are neither monolithic nor solely concerned with a narrowly defined range of womens issues like abortion rights or pay equity Approach to Women Emerges The debate is part of a quiet ferment occurring among Democratic women and strategists as they look toward 1988 Already these trends are emerging  The womens issues of 1988 are likely to emerge from an emphasis on family including day care education jobs and health care rather than the more divisive issues according to some political specialists It makes it possible to reach women across a broad range of classes while at the same time not seeming to address women at the expense of men said Stanley Greenberg a New Haven polltaker  Feminists are divided over the best tactical means of advancing their agenda in 1988 While many are already backing a declared Presidential candidate the possibility of a Schroeder candidacy has been embraced by others notably Ms Smeal There is a yearning a hunger for someone of their own male or female said Irene Natividad head of the National Womens Political Caucus There is a sense that the seven guys no matter what they say dont espouse all of our values in their entirety  The nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court has thrown the abortion issue into sharp relief That could galvanize many feminists and force the Democratic Presidential hopefuls to take a more visible stance on this issue some political specialists say The Presidential campaign is where this issue is going to be played out before the nation said Kate Michelman head of the National Abortion Rights Action League Legacy of 1984 Campaign All these discussions are deeply colored by the 1984 campaign in which the Democratic Presidential hopefuls conducted a highly public courtship of womens groups and their leaders Many Democratic women lobbied hard for the nomination of a woman as Vice President their efforts paid off with Walter F Mondales selection of Geraldine A Ferraro But the election ended with a sound defeat of the Democratic ticket and a round of recriminations within the party much of it directed at such organized interest groups as labor and feminists that played a key role in Mr Mondales nomination Many women countered that Ms Ferraro and her feminist supporters had been scapegoats for a defeat that was inevitable NOW the nations largest feminist group which endorsed Mr Mondale as early as December 1983 has become increasingly distant from the Democratic Party under Ms Smeals leadership No Longer Seen as Homogenous Beyond the apportioning of blame a number of lessons were drawn from the 1984 experience that are shaping the 1988 campaign in the view of many Democratic professionals Chief among them is that the womens vote is not homogenous a fact that was the premise of the Republicans 1984 strategy nor are feminist and womens organizations necessarily the best way to reach the majority of women voters Theres a feeling that interest group messages are not productive for the party as a whole said William Carrick campaign manager for Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri I dont think youre going to see the same kind of appealing to women as female gendergap voters Regardless of the debate over its strategic implications disparate political attitudes of men and women what politicians call the gender gap continue to show up on public opinion surveys Differences Seen in Poll In a New York TimesCBS News Poll conducted from May 18 to 21 30 percent of the women identified themselves as Republicans as against 44 percent who described themselves as Democrats By contrast 31 percent of the men identified themselves as Republicans as against 35 percent who said they were Democrats The poll of 1343 people had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points When divided into men and women the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points The gap narrows but still exists when only white voters are compared For example 34 percent of the white women said they were Republican as against 40 percent who said they were Democratic Some Democrats assert that their party is neglecting this electoral opportunity by drawing the wrong lessons from 1984 Politicians like generals specialize in fighting the last war said Ann F Lewis a Democratic strategist By not focusing on issues like the proposed Federal equal rights amendment pay equity and abortion rights Ms Lewis argues Theyre moving away from the feminist message and thats a message women overwhelmingly want to hear But Joanne Symons a consultant and longtime political activist detects a marked difference between 1984 and 1988 Ms Symons an adviser to Mr Gephardt remembers the atmosphere four years ago when the Democratic Presidential candidates met at breakfast in Washington with a group of politically active women Candidates Have Relaxed One candidate who she declined to name showed up with a briefing book on womens issues that the group had provided in advance He used it to look up the correct answer to every question Ms Symons recalled The atmosphere was almost antagonistic Ms Symons said It was like they were walking into the lionesses den This year Ms Symons contends the guys have come in a relaxed mode and womens issues are a seamless part of their stump speech This in fact is what many strategists and political professionals are advising Some of the most common issues on the Democratic campaign trail this year revolve around children and the family and political professionals say they are particularly resonant with women Former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona for example has been campaigning on the need for day care that is better more affordable and more available This is a daddy issue as well as a mommy issue said Lynn Cutler vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee It is an issue that consumes working couples Gov Michael S Dukakis points to his record in Massachusetts on day care and welfare reform while Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware has centered much of his campaign at least in the early stages on programs for children Issues like day care are significantly less divisive than abortion rights and the equal rights amendment in the view of many political professionals The perception that such issues have taken a back seat outrages some feminists like Ms Smeal who noted in her speech to the National Press Club this week that a recent 1988 agenda produced by the Democratic Leadership Council contained not a word on abortion Support Builds for Schroeder This dissatisfaction is building support among many feminists for a Schroeder candidacy I dont think Schroeders candidacy is a result of this Ms Lewis said But she has been greatly encouraged by the response shes gotten And one big reason is that theres a kind of unsatisfied yearning by women to have a champion in the field Ms Smeal in an interview did not rule out the possibility of running for President herself if no other feminist enters the race As many feminists frame it the political rationale for a woman seeking the nomination is strikingly similar to that advanced by the supporters of the Rev Jesse Jackson in 1984 It is the logical next step in political empowerment it will guarantee the discussion of womens issues in the campaign and it will galvanize other women to run for office Here too however the Ferraro experience of 1984 still leaves scars One prominent Democratic woman who has discussed the Schroeder candidacy at length with other women said Theres just an enormous fear of failure Mrs Schroeder herself says I get the Ferraro thing which I think is irrelevant Nobody says Sam Nunn cant run because Carter was from Georgia
"After Nixon and Reagan, Young Republicans Face '88 With Uncertainty",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/11/us/after-nixon-and-reagan-young-republicans-face-88-with-uncertainty.html,The hottestselling shirt at the Young Republican national convention here depicts a smiling Richard M Nixon Hes Tan Rested and Ready the shirt reads Nixon in 88 The nearly 800 delegates who have gathered here for a threeday convention that started Thursday have hardly begun a Nixon Presidential drive But many of the youthful Republicans make it plain that they were looking to the past with considerable wistfulness and facing the future with some uneasiness With Nixon the organization grew said Lauren Zanca the organizations executive director And then under Ronald Reagan the political atmosphere changed entirely His message of patriotism and optimism struck a chord among young people Now a lot of people are just holding back waiting Theres no Presidential candidate who has the kind of support Reagan had We certainly wont see another Ronald Reagan in 88 said Rhett Davis a 25yearold businessman from Baton Rouge La who is assistant treasurer of the Young Republicans What you see here though are the party leaders of the 1990s And its these people who will give us another Ronald Reagan in 8 or 12 years A Real Hurting Effect Beyond the uncertainty about Presidential politics the Irancontra scandal has plainly disturbed many of the delegates One delegate Brian J Berry 28 the Northeast political director in the Bob Dole Presidential effort observed There is this concern What does it do to the Republican environment its uncontrollable It has a real hurting effect on party activities Mr Davis said Like many of the young Republicans here Mr Davis is an entrepreneur he is vice president of a chemical pesticide plant I kill bugs and beat Democrats he said With several others Mr Davis says he leans toward the Presidential candidacy of Representative Jack F Kemp is amazed at Vice President Bushs apparently weak support among the heavily conservative Young Republicans and impressed that the Dole organization has sent out letters to every delegate and operative at the convention It is a measure of the potential influence of the Young Republicans a 220000member organization that six Presidential contenders including Mr Bush will address them over the next few days and seek their individual support Although the organization itself will not endorse a candidate before the 1988 Republican convention many of its members will sign up with candidates to organize and raise funds An Important Constituency Young Republicans are a very very important constituency said Roger Stone a Republican political consultant in Washington who was national chairman of the Young Republicans from 1977 to 1979 Along with little old ladies they provide the foot soldiers for the Republican Party They also provide the potential leadership for the Republican Party with the Young Republican organization serving historically as an ideological testing ground for the party Numerous state and national legislators as well as such party leaders as William E Brock the Secretary of Labor and Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr chairman of the Republican National Committee have served as leaders of the Young Republican National Federation Traditionally Young Republicans have been a leading indicator of the direction of the party said Mr Stone Through the 1960s for example Nixon supporters in the Young Republicans defeated supporters of Nelson A Rockefeller In the 1970s Reagan supporters played central roles in the Young Republican leadership This year the leadership struggle within the organization pits a moderate 38yearold Richard Jacobs a gasoline distributor from Jackson Tenn against John Traier a 30yearold accountant from Clifton NJ Mr Traier is viewed as a conservative hardliner on such issues as abortion Mr Traiers supporters have termed Mr Jacobs a backer of Mr Bush while Mr Jacobss supporters say that Mr Traier is a Dole supporter Each insists he is not supporting a candidate An Image of Elitism Both men agree along with many Young Republicans that the organization is blemished by an image of upperclass elitism and that it failed despite some efforts to reach out to minorities and to groups that do not tend to vote for Republicans The number of blacks and Hispanic people at the convention for example is negligible There was this elitist attitude for a long time said Alander Garris a 19yearold student at the University of Pittsburgh one of a small number of blacks at the convention It was like an organization of WASPs I suppose Standing at a booth and distributing leaflets for the Bush Presidential candidacy he said that his parents were Democrats but that he had opted for the Young Republicans in part out of selfinterest I want to be a lawyer he said I think I can develop and move further as a Republican I dont share every conservative belief Im not a Reagan lover or a Reagan hater Im not blinded to certain things I just think I can go further With the departure of President Reagan from the White House some of the delegates said the ideological and even personal tensions within the group that have been muted threaten to emerge Theres a distinct separation into camps in this organization said Mr Davis at a reception Wednesday night As I look across this room its evident There are people here from California who publicly campaign for gay rights abortion the ERA And there are people from Alabama who would ask those Califorians how they could be Young Republicans Theres a real split here
Powell on His Approach: Doing Justice Case by Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/us/powell-on-his-approach-doing-justice-case-by-case.html,Amid furniture marked with little yellow stickers for the movers Justice Lewis F Powell Jr sought the other day to sum up his approach to hundreds of hard cases over more than 15 years at the strategic center of the most powerful court in the world I never think of myself as having a judicial philosophy he said I have in mind that each one of these cases is enormously important to the parties particularly to the defendant in a criminal case I try to be careful to do justice to the particular case rather than try to write principles that will be new or original or whatever Justice Powell 79 years old retired June 26 and in a rare threehour interview he discussed the biggest cases and how he had wrestled with them the death penalty abortion Nixon tapes affirmative action wiretaps and more  and the private relationships among the Justices He provided such personal details as his wifes tearful reaction when he reluctantly accepted President Nixons nomination in 1971 Vast Social Change The Justice sitting in shirtsleeves in his booklined office at the Court also reflected in a soft Tidewater drawl on what it had been like for a conservative Virginian not by nature eager for social change to witness and help engineer some of the biggest social changes in the nations history There was de jure segregation in the Southern states not only of the schools but of public accommodations facilities theaters he recalled I just cant imagine how I grew up and accepted that as a normal way of life in this country Choosing his words with care Justice Powell stressed that his reminiscences were not intended to reflect on any aspect of the brewing battle over President Reagans effort to fill the Court vacancy with Judge Robert H Bork who has denounced some major rulings on affirmative action abortion and other issues in which Justice Powell joined Honoring the Constitution He took pains to note that he had decided to depart from his longstanding practice of not granting interviews because of the celebration of the bicentennial of the Constitution He said he wanted to help the public to have a better understanding of the way the Supreme Court functions He has given one previous news interview since joining the Court for a recent public television broadcast Justice Powell made these points about the Court in the interview last week and in several telephone conversations this week  One mustnt take seriously some of the strong language that appears in dissenting opinions The Justices here understand that thats sort of a privilege and it does not imply any personal feeling For example I think Justice Brennan is considered a friend of all of us Hes one of my close friends And sometimes he writes with a very sharp pen if hes in dissent And Ive probably been guilty of that myself  The Courts history including the adherence of the Burger Court to major Warren Court decisions expanding the rights of criminal defendants showed that it tends not to make radical departures from precedent and reflected the need for continuity and reasonable predictability of the law  He would probably vote against capital punishment if he were a legislator although the Constitution allows it  His experience as a college trustee had helped shape what may have been his most important opinion the one that set the course of the law on affirmative action in 1978 by upholding use of flexible preferences but not strict quotas to increase opportunities for minority groups  While refusing to comment in any way on Judge Bork Justice Powell endorsed an evolving concept of constitutional rights that seemed to contrast with Judge Borks calls for strict adherence to the original intent of the framers  The landmark 1973 decision in which the Court recognized a constitutional right to abortion was extremely difficult for him but he had no second thoughts about joining the majority When his retirement was announced by Chief Justice William H Rehnquist to a stunned courtroom audience Justice Powell recalled I was in a state of shock also you become very sentimental about this Court and although I was not eager to come here I retire with genuine regret A Little Memo A Change and a Ruling He spoke fondly of his eight colleagues whom he described as uniformly well educated intelligent and hardworking We disagree strongly he said But at conferences and in the general relationship between the Justices theres a high level of congeniality and friendship This included scrupulous observance of birthdays at lunch together with sherry and sometimes cake Camaraderie gives way to serious negotiations mostly through written memorandums he said after the Court has heard arguments in a case and taken a tentative vote in a private conference Whenever youre assigned to write a 5to4 decision you know that you cannot afford to lose a vote he said And sometimes you end up on the short end of a case when you started out with five votes and that makes you more than a little unhappy He added You receive memos from other Justices saying Dear Lewis Im inclined to join your opinion but it would help me if you changed so and so And sometimes a Justice will suggest language sometimes a Justice will give you a little memo and in order to get a Court you accommodate requests for changes as far as you can go He praised Chief Justice Rehnquists leadership style observing In many ways hes the best educated person Ive ever worked with On a lighter level he said the Chief Justice was fair in allocating opinionwriting duties in cases the Justices call dogs He said A dog is a case that you wish the Chief Justice had assigned to some other Justice A deadly dull case a tax case for example Conservative Instincts Vs What the Law Says Justice Powell said that when he joined the Court he had made a conscious effort to disassociate himself somewhat from his background so as not to let his reading of the law be skewed by his conservative instincts and by any bias he may have acquired representing corporate clients at a large Richmond law firm You cant do it completely he said but in any event I tried Some of his decisions he remarked had disappointed his old friends One of his first major opinions for the Court rejected not only the position of the Nixon Administration but also his own statements in an article before his appointment He held in 1972 that the President may not authorize wiretaps of dissidents suspected of violent plans without a judicial warrant In a telephone conversation about that case he said Of course when you get on the Court you dont feel precisely the same about issues as you did before Soon after that the Court was confronted with the constitutional challenge to state laws outlawing abortion that was to produce the most controversial ruling of recent decades Roe v Wade upholding the right to abortion I dont think Id ever really thought about it seriously before Justice Powell said The abortion case was a very difficult case for me extremely difficult I was raised in a very religious family But he said that he had been shocked that the Texas law under challenge appeared to bar abortion even in cases of rape and that he had been moved by arguments that the constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law encompassed reproductive choices You had the laws of the vast majority of the states one way and very strong considerations the other and identifying the provisions of the Constitution that were relevant presented problems Justice Powell recalled Ten years later he wrote a decision for the Court strongly reaffirming and extending Roe in the face of attacks by the Reagan Administration and others Some Concern On Making Law Despite the continuing public and scholarly criticism of the abortion decisions and the dwindling of the Courts original 7to2 majority for broad abortion rights to a single vote  his own Justice Powell said I never had any second thoughts about it But he said he did have some concern about overextending the analytical premise of the abortion decision  the doctrine of substantive due process under which the Court has recognized an amorphous right of sexual and family privacy I have been trying to be careful about substantive due process he said He said he was mindful of Justice Hugo Blacks 1963 opinion criticizing the doctrine as a vehicle for judges to substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies who are elected to pass laws This concern Justice Powell said was one reason he reversed his vote and thus the outcome in a major 5to4 ruling last year upholding a Georgia law against homosexual sodomy But Justice Powell also indicated that he had no hesitation about invoking substantive due process when necessary to correct what he regarded as a manifest injustice He recalled his 1977 opinion for the Court that a woman had a constitutional right to share a household with her two grandsons contrary to a local zoning law I thought it would be outrageous to separate that family he said The Lawyers Approach Case by Case While he has sometimes been criticized by legal purists for zigzagging back and forth on such issues based on his personal sense of justice without adhering to a clear logically consistent constitutional philosophy he had no apologies for his pragmatic approach He said it reflected decades of hammering out solutions to legal problems as a private practitioner He noted that he had been the first Justice in many years to come to the Court directly from private law practice His approval of flexible affirmative action plans and disapproval of rigid quotas for members of minority groups in the 1978 University of California v Bakke decision was typical of his careful balancing of competing factors Id thought about the problem a great deal he said From his service as a trustee of three colleges he said I had a genuine understanding that diversity in a student body was particularly desirable He also noted that he had advised corporate clients in the late 1960s that the time had come to consider race and sex along with test scores and other relevant factors in making employment decisions All this Justice Powell said made it fairly easy for me to uphold voluntary affirmative action that permits weighing of a variety of factors including race and sex He said he thought his hardest case may have been the one that led swiftly to the resignation of the man who had appointed him the 1974 decision ordering President Nixon to surrender his White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor The case caused all the Justices a great deal of anguish because of the magnitude of what was at stake Justice Powell said He added President Nixon deserves commendation in history for accepting promptly and without equivocation the decision of the Court If the President had defied the ruling Justice Powell said there was nothing we could have done a constitutional crisis would have ensued In the Middle On the Death Penalty Another issue that has long tugged especially hard at the conscience of the Court Justice Powell said was the death penalty As was true on most issues he found himself in the Courts middle He wrote the Courts controversial 5to4 decision this year upholding Georgias death sentencing system in the face of strong statistical evidence that killers of white victims are more likely to be condemned In the interview he said the criminal justice system must be based not on statistics but on the consciences of jurors But he has repeatedly voted to strike down particular applications of the penalty that seemed to him unjust In a dissent on the day he retired he strongly implied that he might find it unconstitutional to execute any murderer who was a minor at the time of his crime Looking back on dozens of death penalty appeals Justice Powell said he would probably vote to abolish the penalty if he were a legislator even though he said the procedural safeguards to prevent arbitrariness that he had helped create in a 1976 decision had made the system as fair as possible The reasons Its irreversible nature and questionable effectiveness If the death penalty deterred murders it would be fully justified he said One reason he doubts it does he said is that current Federal law allows death row inmates so many repetitive appeals to state and then Federal courts that weve had capital cases which werent decided finally for 10 or 11 years Justice Powell suggested that either abolishing the penalty entirely or on the other hand allowing speedier executions by streamlining appeal procedures might be sensible courses for lawmakers to consider Constitutions Language Not SelfExplanatory Asked about the harsh criticism of the Court by certain Administration officials and others who have accused it of judicial legislation he noted that such criticism has been commonplace throughout history Nonetheless he said I think people understand that the liberties we enjoy to a greater extent than any other country in the world are in effect guaranteed by the Courts enforcing the Bill of Rights The First Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Sixth Amendment Eighth Amendment all were framed happily by farsighted founders in a way that requires interpretation he said The word liberty in the Fifth Amendment that encompasses some of the most important rights people have He was asked whether this meant that judges must make value judgments of their own to enforce the Constitution I wouldnt characterize them as value judgments as much as I would a consideration of history and the extent to which decisions of this Court reflect an evolving concept of particular provisions of the Constitution Justice Powell said softly The language of the Constitution is not selfexplanatory Justice Powell registered a complaint about the standard description of him as the Courts swing vote He said he had not desired or endeavored to be the swing vote in the sense of waiting to see how the others were leaning before staking out his own positions The only time I ever considered myself a swinger was when I was in college at Washington and Lee Justice Powell added with a laugh noting that he had been something of a dancer in those days Law Practice Favored Until Duty Called Lewis Franklin Powell Jr was born in Suffolk Va on Sept 19 1907 in what he stressed was a very different world from the one he has come to know and helped to shape a world in which blacks were secondclass citizens and a womans place was in the home He said he decided to become a lawyer when he was a teenager because after copious reading he figured out that the people at the center of the stage were mostly lawyers and military men In his college years he met Josephine Pierce Rucker of Richmond They were married in 1936 and have three daughters and a son When he returned to Virginia from Harvard Law School Justice Powell recalled my Dad thought that Id become too liberal but I suppose fathers tend to think that He built a successful career as a lawyer on four decades of six and sevenday work weeks with time out for service as an Air Force intelligence officer in World War II winning several decorations Later he was president of the American Bar Association from 1964 to 1965 and presided over the peaceful desegregation of Richmonds schools as head of the school board When Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon called him in 1971 to offer the Court nomination Justice Powell recalled he told them he was not interested I preferred the freedom and diversity of being a practicing lawyer he recalled I always felt I could put my hat on and walk out I always wanted to say what I wanted to say Mr Nixon who wanted a Southerner for political reasons insisted He said that he thought I had a duty to do it Justice Powell said That persuaded him along with the advice of his law partners But late the night his nomination was announced he said after a swarm of reporters had descended on his Richmond home and all but one had left Jo burst out crying and said that Id made a great mistake The reporter was discreet enough to keep it to himself A man both proud and modest who prefers to adorn his office with pictures of former law clerks rather than framed certificates and other badges of achievement Justice Powell leaned forward to make a point I would like to emphasize that Im very grateful that I was persuaded to change my mind he said as the evening shadows began creeping up the Courts marble edifice I realize now the extent to which it is a privilege to serve here
What Is to Be Done About the Bork Nomination; Political Creationism,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/opinion/l-what-is-to-be-done-about-the-bork-nomination-political-creationism-751487.html,To the Editor Judge Bork the Senate and Politics editorial July 2 is an effective message to the Senate particularly on the importance that should be placed on the 1986 election results As the inquiry about Robert H Bork begins two aspects of his record require special scrutiny First he has argued that original intent is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision This now familiar claim masks a type of literalism that is most popular among biblical inerrantists The inherent arrogance of this insistence on seeking the true meaning of the original is quickly manifest because such claimants consistently couple their approach with assurances that they alone possess knowledge of that original intent Like Fundamentalists who confidently preach their dogma against the backdrop of the Bible says people like Judge Bork and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d create an original intent to fit their political philosophy Even as a Pat Robertson or a Jerry Falwell claims the mantle of the divine to provide the correct interpretation of the Bible so their political counterparts presume enlightenment from the framers History is to the contrary not the private preserve of those who ultimately pay it the least respect And how do these selfdefined authorities practice their craft How can the White House be so smug about the intent of the framers in 1787 when in just the last year its lawyers busied themselves in a hopelessly flawed attempt to determine the original intent of the Boland Amendments Even members of Congress cant agree among themselves on that intent Historical inerrantism is as foolish for the Constitution as it is for the Bible It can lead to a rigid political creationism that will foster an experiment on our liberties Second Judge Bork uses his premise on intent to remove protection of privacy from the Federal courts This argument from silence respecting the Constitution recalls a major reason James Madison originally opposed the inclusion of a Bill of Rights He wrote Jefferson in October 1788 there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude Madison feared an argument from silence that would restrict rights that were not listed or clearly defined He used as his example the private right of conscience that might well be narrowed much more by public definition Madison ultimately supported the Bill of Rights because it would counteract the impulses of interest and passion but his earlier uneasiness is understood in light of the threats posed by a Bork confirmation both to the abortion decision Roe v Wade and the right to privacy ruling in Griswold v Connecticut Those who affirm a living evolving republic and cherish an expansive view of human rights are buttressed by a principled Constitution Such people are far more compatible with the ideas current in the Philadelphia of 1787 than are those who see the Constitution as a closed inerrant mandate ROBERT S ALLEY Professor of Humanities University of Richmond Richmond July 3 1987
Bork Fight Gives Abortion Rights Convention Something to Shout About,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/13/us/bork-fight-gives-abortion-rights-convention-something-to-shout-about.html,Advocates of legal abortion met here over the weekend to map a national campaign aimed at persuading the Senate not to confirm Judge Robert H Bork as a Supreme Court Justice The nomination transformed the threeday annual convention of the National Abortion Rights Action League from what had been intended as an internal organizational session into one charged with activist fervor The league like many other rights groups also hopes to use the momentum gained in mobilizing opposition to Judge Bork for a broader purpose putting social issues high on the 1988 election campaign agenda Many people at the convention sported newly printed Borkbusters buttons emblazoned with a circle and a diagonal line crossing out a picture of the conservative Federal appeals court judge who has argued that Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion was unconstitutional And on Saturday while Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio and a member of the Judiciary Committee gave a rousing speech supporting legal abortion members of the organization chanted Just say no just say no The chant was borrowed from the slogan of the Reagan Administrations antidrug program Focus on Judiciary Panel The abortion rights league which has reported a national membership of 250000 began planning to try to stop the confirmation immediately after President Reagan announced July 1 that he would nominate Judge Bork to replace Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who has retired after a career in which he often cast what was considered a swing vote on the Court The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on Judge Borks nomination in September and its members are the primary focus of the league which will begin its lobbying effort Monday on Capitol Hill Two dozen directors of the groups state affiliates plan to meet with senators and representatives before carrying their effort into the legislators home states Bob Bingaman the leagues Washington lobbyist said the organization had drawn up a list of key senators starting with moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats in the hope that one might take the lead in publicly opposing Judge Bork Mr Bingaman said the top of the list included Howell Heflin of Alabama and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona  who as conservative Democrats have important votes on the Judiciary Committee  as well as Republicans who are perceived as sympathetic to legal abortion but who voted last summer to confirm Associate Justice William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice a move the league opposed These Republicans Mr Bingaman said include Bob Packwood of Oregon Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut Daniel J Evans of Washington and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania Disappointment After Speeches Well try to stop this nomination in the committee Mr Bingaman said But I think at this point a bestcase scenario would be that the committee will send the nomination to the full Senate without any recommendation Some league members said they had hoped that Mr Metzenbaum in his speech to them Saturday would announce his opposition to Judge Bork But the Senator said he would not make up his mind until after the judge had testified before the Judiciary Committee Other members said they were also disappointed that Senator Packwood who addressed the organization Friday had not taken a stronger stand against Judge Bork If I conclude that there is any possibility that he will overturn Roe vs Wade Mr Packwood said I will not only oppose him I will not only filibuster but I will lead a filibuster But Mr Packwood added I would have no doubts personally one on one trusting my civil liberties to his discretional judgment Kate Michelman the leagues executive director said that in addition to Washington lobbying the organization planned a series of demonstrations and letterwriting and telephone campaigns during the August Congressional recess in the home states of senators seen as important to the effort Arlene Swartz director of the leagues affiliate in New York State said Judge Borks opponents had already started a coordinated telephone campaign and were sending thousands of postcards and telegrams to members of Congress The New York organization was able to begin the effort on short notice Ms Swartz said by using a computerized system under which league members authorize the organization to send out telegrams in their name without prior consultation
"BORK, AS SEEN FROM TWO ANGLES; Plainly, The Man For the Job",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/13/opinion/bork-as-seen-from-two-angles-plainly-the-man-for-the-job.html,President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court has liberal ideologues howling with fury The central issue is already clear Should a liberal majority on certain key issues be perpetuated or should the Court evolve towards a conservative majority Judge Bork is hardly an unknown quantity to the Senate In 1982 it confirmed him unanimously as a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia a tribunal second in importance only to the Supreme Court In fact he was found so wellqualified that not one senator even requested a rollcall vote He was confirmed by a voice vote which is used in noncontroversial matters And just last week the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Joseph Biden although critical called the nominee a brilliant man The 1982 confirmation hearings fully explored Judge Borks role as Solicitor General in the 1973 firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox Judge Bork testified that he had discussed resigning with Attorney General Elliot L Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D Ruckelshaus rather than fire Mr Cox Mr Richardson who supports the Bork nomination recently said he urged Judge Bork at the time not to resign Had members of the Senate any serious reservations about Judge Borks integrity in 1982 surely at least one would have voted against him None did Judge Bork is plainly a man of the highest integrity As a young lawyer and with a wife and three children to support he left a promising and profitable career with one of Chicagos most prominent law firms to teach at Yale Law School where he remained for 19 years His works have been published in the most prestigous law journals He served as Solicitor General the Justice Departments third highest post for four years When nominated to his present judgeship he was given the American Bar Associations highest rating exceptionally well qualified President Reagan could have found no more qualified nominee With all this one might reasonably expect the nomination to sail through Surely the Senate was not careless in examining Judge Borks qualifications in 1982 And didnt the Senate confirm Antonin Scalia  more conservative than Judge Bork  to the Court just last year But this time its different say the liberals Because the Court is now split four to four on certain social issues such as abortion and affirmative action Judge Borks confirmation might change the tribunals ideological balance The liberals understandably want the Court always to be liberal The theory is that the Courts philosophical balance should never change once it is already liberal But if the Court always had the same balance it could never change bad decisions Plessy v Ferguson which in 1896 upheld school segregation could not have been overruled by Brown v Board of Education Decisions that before the New Deal struck down social welfare laws such as those restricting child labor would still be on the books Despite all the fine theories about the Courts objectivity the truth is that Justices sometimes make mistakes And when they make mistakes they are accountable to no one Fortunately the Constitution provides a means to deal with an errant Court The President fills vacancies with the advice and consent of the Senate James Madison wanted to give that power to the Senate but the Founders decided one man was more likely to choose well than many And Presidents beginning with George Washington have used their authority as a democratic check on judicial abuse of power One of the important issues in the Presidential campaigns of 1980 and 1984 was the likelihood of Court vacancies given the age and health of certain Justices Three years ago the Democratic candidate Walter F Mondale argued that the election would determine the Courts direction Mr Reagan agreed with his opponent and seized the chance to articulate the views of most Americans who felt the courts had gone too far in protecting the rights of criminals at the expense of society and of their victims and too far in imposing busing and reverse discrimination to insure racial equality Many Americans also felt the courts were exceeding their powers usurping those of Congress and the state legislatures and worst of all substituting personal views for a scholarly reading of the Constitution as in Roe v Wade which struck down all state laws prohibiting abortion Mr Reagan won What the liberals object to in his choice of Judge Bork is not Judge Borks professional qualifications but his conservative judicial philosophy They want to control the Court as they have for the last two decades  and the people be damned If they can find a way to thwart the President they will But Ronald Reagan holds the aces Hes got the public on his side If the Democrats block Judge Bork they will hand the Republicans a powerful issue that if used well will give the GOP not only the White House in 1988 but possibly the Senate too

Saving Bork From Both Friends and Enemies,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/16/opinion/saving-bork-from-both-friends-and-enemies.html,The nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the United States Supreme Court has drawn predictable reactions from both extremes of the political spectrum One can fairly say that the confirmation is as much endangered by one extreme as the other The liberal lefts characterization of Judge Bork as a rightwing ideologue is being reinforced by the enthusiastic embrace of his neoconservative supporters His confirmation may well depend on whether he can persuade the Senate that this characterization is a false one In my view Judge Bork is neither an ideologue nor an extreme rightwinger either in his judicial philosophy or in his personal position on current social issues I base this assessment on a postnomination review of Judge Borks published articles and opinions and on 20 years of personal association as a professional colleague or adversary I make it as a liberal Democrat and as an advocate of civil rights before the Supreme Court Lets look at several categories of concern Judicial philosophy The essence of Judge Borks judicial philosophy is selfrestraint He believes that judges should interpret the Constitution and the laws according to neutral principles without reference to their personal views as to desirable social or legislative policy insofar as this is humanly practicable All Justices subscribe at least nominally to this philosophy but few rigorously observe it Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes Louis D Brandeis Felix Frankfurter Potter Stewart and Lewis F Powell Jr were among those few and Judge Borks articles and opinions confirm that he would be another He has criticized the rightwing activism of the pre1937 court majorities that struck down social legislation on due process and equal protection grounds He is likely to be a strong vote against any similar tendencies that might arise during his own tenure Freedom of speech As a judge Judge Bork has supported broad constitutional protection for political speech but has questioned whether the First Amendment also protects literary and scientific speech However he has since agreed that these forms of speech are also covered by the amendment And as a judge he has voted to extend the constitutional protection of the press against libel judgments well beyond the previous state of the law In his view It is the task of the judge in this generation to discern how the Framers values defined in the context of the world they knew apply to the world we know Over Justice then Judge Antonin Scalias objections he was willing to apply the First Amendments guarantee    to frame new doctrine to cope with changes in libel law [ huge damage awards ] that threaten the functions of a free press Civil rights While Judge Bork adheres to the original intent school of constitutional interpretation he plainly includes the intent of the Framers of the postCivil War amendments outlawing slavery and racial discrimination In this spirit he welcomed the 1955 decision in Brown v Board of Education proclaiming public school segregation unconstitutional as surely correct and as one of the Courts most splendid vindications of human freedom In 1963 he did in fact oppose the public accommodations title of the Civil Rights Act as an undesirable legislative interference with private business behavior But in his 1973 confirmation hearing as Solicitor General he acknowledged he had been wrong and agreed that the statute has worked very well At least when compared to the Reagan Justice Department Judge Bork as Solicitor General was almost a paragon of civil rights advocacy Judge Bork was later a severe critic of Justice Powells decisive concurring opinion in the University of California v Bakke case leaving state universities free to take racial diversity into account in their admissions policies so long as they did not employ numerical quotas But this criticism was limited to the constitutional theory of the opinion Judge Bork expressly conceded that the limited degree of affirmative action it permitted might well be a desirable social policy Abortion Judge Bork has been a leading critic of Roe v Wade particularly its holding that the Bill of Rights implies a constitutional right of privacy that some state abortion laws invade But this does not mean that he is a sure vote to overrule Roe v Wade his writings reflect a respect for precedent that would require him to weigh the cost as well as the benefits of reversing a decision deeply imbedded in our legal and social systems Justice Stewart who had dissented from the 1965 decision in Griswold v Connecticut on which Roe v Wade is based accepted Griswold as binding in 1973 and joined the Roe v Wade majority Judge Bork has also testified against legislative efforts to reverse the court by defining life to begin at conception or by removing abortion cases from Federal court jurisdiction If the extreme right is embracing him as a convinced righttolifer who would strike down the many state laws now permitting abortions it is probably mistaken Presidential powers I thought in October 1973 that Judge Bork should have resigned along with Elliot L Richardson and William S Ruckelshaus rather than carry out President Richard M Nixons instruction to fire Archibald Cox as Watergate special prosecutor But as Mr Richardson has recently observed it was inevitable that the President would eventually find someone in the Justice Department to fire Mr Cox and if all three top officers resigned the departments morale and the pursuit of the Watergate investigation might have been irrreparably crippled Mr Bork allowed the Cox staff to carry on and continue pressing for the Presidents tapes  the very issue over which Mr Cox had been fired He appointed Leon Jaworski as the new special prosecutor and the investigations continued to their successful conclusion Indeed it is my understanding that Mr Nixon later asked Why did I go to the trouble of firing Cox I do not share Judge Borks constitutional and policy doubts about the statute institutionalizing the special prosecutor function But if the constitutional issue reaches the Supreme Court he will most likely recuse himself as he has apparently already done in withdrawing from a motions panel about to consider this issue in the Court of Appeals Moreover as he testified in 1973 he accepts the need for independent special prosecutors in cases involving the President and his close associates Balancethebudget amendment While this proposed amendment is not a nearterm Supreme Court issue Judge Borks position on it is significant because support for that amendment is a litmus test of rightwing ideology He has publicly opposed the amendment on several grounds including its unenforceability except by judges who are singularly illequipped to weigh the economic policy considerations that judicial enforcement would entail This reasoning is far from the ritual cant of a rightwing ideologue Experience shows that it is risky to pinpoint Supreme Court Justices along the ideological spectrum and in the great majority of cases that reach the Court ideology has little effect on the outcome The conventional wisdom today places two Justices on the liberal side three in the middle and three on the conservative side I predict that if Judge Bork is confirmed the conventional wisdom of 1993 will place him closer to the middle than to the right and not far from the Justice whose chair he has been nominated to fill Every new appointment creates some change in the balance of the Court but of those on the list the President reportedly considered Judge Bork is one of the least to create a decisive one
WASHINGTON TALK: Political Memo; The Litmus Test: Use It or Confine It to the Lab?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/17/us/washington-talk-political-memo-the-litmus-test-use-it-or-confine-it-to-the-lab.html,If candidates want applause at either Democratic or Republican functions these days all they have to do is mention the Strategic Defense Initiative or the Nicaraguan contras When Democrats attack Star Wars or aid to the contras audiences start applauding before the first sentence is out When Republicans defend the antimissile shield or Nicaraguan insurgents they get cheers that shake the rafters These are the issues that move the souls of party loyalists what politicians and their Washington consultants call litmustest issues Just as litmus paper is used to test whether a substance is acidic so are certain issues used as tests of ideological purity Some Tricky Questions The term litmus test is generally used pejoratively to suggest a certain closemindedness on the part of party activists But Ann F Lewis a leader of the Democratic Partys liberal wing points out One persons litmus test is another persons fundamental principle On issues like civil rights she argues it is legitimate for partisans to demand loyalty to certain ideas Why should Democrats want to nominate someone who thinks as a Republican Still litmus tests raise three tricky political questions that constantly haunt party leaders here in the capital  To what extent is a party willing to compromise on principles to win a general election  What is a party to do when issues that concern its hard core do not matter much to the broader group of voters who usually support the party at election time  When happens when the litmus tests change when a party is in the process of redefining where it stands on certain matters Democrats Recall the 1950s For Democrats litmus tests on foreign policy and military issues pose particular problems because the party has changed dramatically since the Vietnam War Hardline antiCommunism was once the controlling idea in the party especially after Republicans in the 1950s accused their opponents of being soft on Communism Presentday Democratic advocates of intervention are fond of quoting John F Kennedys tougher statements on foreign policy such as his declaration in the 1960 campaign that the world faced a struggle for supremacy between two conflicting ideologies freedom under God versus ruthless godless tyranny But as the antiwar movement became an increasingly important party constituency during and after the Vietnam War statements like Kennedys became less acceptable they flunked the litmus tests especially among Democrats who customarily vote in primaries or attend caucuses These days Democrats who are more hawkish on military issues face problems especially because of the need to do well in Iowa the first caucus state of 1988 Al Fromm director of the Democratic Leadership Council a group of moderate to conservative Democrats said In Iowa the peace movement is a lot stronger than it is in a lot of other places Former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona supports this view noting that questions about complex and littleknown weapons systems such as the D5 missile come with surprising frequency in Iowa Indeed some nuclear disarmament groups have made opposition to the D5  a highly accurate submarinelaunched ballistic missile  a litmus test in the 1988 election But others of like mind particularly those based in Washington have urged a less exacting less specific approach They argue that all the contenders for the Democratic nomination are essentially sympathetic to arms control and should not be pressed too hard on every issue lest they lose all the flexibility they will need to win the November election This approach pleases most of the Democratic aspirants Using a polevault image Mr Babbitt said The interest groups have lowered the cross bar Democrats are so tired of losing elections he said that they are prepared to be more flexible and not force candidates to jump so high for support in the primaries Still crucial litmus tests remain Many liberal Democrats for example wonder whether Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia is so far from the liberal mainstream of the party  he has favored aid to the contras for example and has voted with conservatives on some civil rights issues that he will be ruled out of contention if he decides to run for President At the least Mr Nunns strategists are saying that if he ran he would probably not even contest Iowa where the litmus tests loom largest The Biden Example There are other examples of litmus test politics at work on the Democratic side The eagerness with which Senator Joseph R Biden Jr announced his opposition to the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court was widely taken as a sign of the power of litmus tests In the eyes of many politicians Mr Biden a Democratc Presidential contender who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition in advance of the hearings on Judge Borks nomination so as to show his loyalty to the partys civil rights and feminist forces which oppose the nomination Similarly Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri dropped his support for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion a testament to the power of the movement for abortion rights within the Democratic Party A Republican Comeback On the Republican side litmus tests are making a comeback of sorts In the 1984 campaign with President Reagan certain of renomination Republicans did not have to worry much about such things Mr Reagan himself was the litmus test and whatever was good for his reelection was presumed to be good for the Republicans But 1988 is shaping up quite differently All the things that Reagan has kept bottled up in that party cant be held down anymore Paul Maslin a Democratic polltaker said with some glee Robert Teeter a strategist for Vice President Bush argues that litmus tests come from two sources  the groups within each party that care passionately about certain issues and candidates who can use a litmus test to promote themselves at the expense of others One candidate clearly pursuing the second course is Representative Jack F Kemp of New York Mr Kemp is trying to consolidate the Republican right by pushing for the deployment of the Star Wars program and opposing some of the arms control agreements with the Soviet Union that the Reagan Administration is supporting AntiCommunism is the ultimate Republican litmus test Mr Kemps advisers argue and the Congressman wants to outflank everyone  notably Mr Bush and Bob Dole the Senate Republican leader  on the question Abortion is an issue that falls more within Mr Teeters first category  a case where a movement active in the party has pushed it well beyond its earlier positions Polls show that Republicans are divided on the issue with many in the party favoring legalized abortion But those who are opposed to abortion have become such a strong Republican constituency that opposition to abortion is now very nearly a party principle Mr Bush has steadily toughened his stand against abortion and now says it should be legal only in cases of rape incest or when the life of the mother is in danger Perhaps the greatest problem of litmus tests is that although they may galvanize party leaders and organizers they are sometimes of little interest to the broader electorate Aid to the contras for example is rarely at the top of the average voters list of worries Not Even a Unifying Issue For the Republicans it is not even a unifying issue A New York Times CBS News Poll taken by telephone on July 9 found the party evenly split on the question 40 percent favored contra aid 39 percent opposed it The finding had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus seven percentage points In the end both parties will find ways of coping with litmus test politics and containing it For Democrats the testing will be less severe than it was in 1984 when Walter F Mondale by beleaguered by group after group For Republicans however the testing will become tougher
"Women's Movement, Its Ideals Accepted, Faces Subtler Issues",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/17/us/women-s-movement-its-ideals-accepted-faces-subtler-issues.html,As the 21st meeting of the National Organization for Women starts in Philadelphia today NOW and other feminist organizations seem to be at an ebb torn internally over difficult new issues and struggling to hold on to gains already made In some ways however the organized womens movement is overshadowed by millions of women throughout the nation who now take its ideals as a matter of course as they deal individually with questions of equality at home and in the workplace The people I hang out with or socialize with arent hardcore cardcarrying feminists Linda Jackson a police detective in Raleigh NC said in a recent interview But there are womens issues they take sides with One she mentioned representative of the newer sort of womens issue was the mans role in raising children before and after divorce Some of the basic questions of liberation that inspired the modern womens movement 20 years ago entry into professional schools government jobs political candidacy and such basic rights as getting equal treatment when applying for credit have largely been resolved Now Subtler Issues But now in part because of those gains women are being confronted with new and demanding issues surrounding their children mates and lives Career women grapple with the dual stresses of family and highpressure jobs single mothers struggle to stay out of poverty and childless women confront the possiblity of having successful careers at the expense of motherhood Women have needs of intimacy home and family Betty Friedan an early movement leader whose Feminine Mystique was published 25 years ago said in a recent interview There have got to be some new concrete developments and new realities around these issues to move young women But Ms Friedan acknowledges that dealing with these concerns is more difficult than the breaking through of the first obvious barriers that united all women And Lois Galgay Reckitt the executive vice president of NOW noted the hostile political climate the movement faces today It is all well and good to advocate forward progress but to do that you have to stop the slippage backwards she said The fact that we have held on to the bulk of the gains during the Reagan Administration is a minor miracle One issue she did cite as an area of recent progress was greater awareness of the need for child care for working women That is a key concern for Barbara Grogan president and founder of Western Industrial Contractors in Denver I dont think our kids should bear the brunt of having both parents work she said Still Ms Grogran bristles at talk of the womens movement being in a state of paralysis citing the evidence of strides around her We see more and more women in positions of leadership and it seems normal she said The generation of young women expect to see women in those roles and assume those roles are open to them The Young Appreciate Gains Those young women may not identify with the leaders of the womens movement  many have been leaders since the beginning and are now in their 50s and older  and they may not join its organizations or read its magazines But many do feel part of its aspirations Talk of the womens movement being over and my generation being a postfeminist generation makes me angry said Priscilla Smith a 1984 graduate of Yale who now works for the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare The womens culture and communities are alive and well and very strong Her generation Ms Smith said is no different from others in that it is most concerned about work and relationships Ms Friedan and others believe the organized womens movement must try to galvanize around the issues arising from those concerns  But the newer issues have been more difficult to confront and resolve In some cases such as pornography and maternity leave prominent feminists disagree on the proper feminist stance In other cases the issues themselves  daycare centers at work or equal pay for different jobs that are judged to be of comparable worth  are more difficult A corporation can more easily see the fairness of hiring women on an equal basis for example than the additional costs of caring for their children Busy Fighting the Right And discrimination is more subtle than it once was Patients are no longer surprised or make a big deal out of being treated by women said Dr Perri Klass an author and pediatrician and female doctors may not worry about gross pay inequity But they may still be left out of the routes that lead to promotion she said And as new tougher issues have arisen the womens movement since losing the long battle for an equal rights amendment five years ago has spent much of its energy fending off attacks against affirmative action and abortion from a conservative Justice Department and organized religion Representative Patricia Schroeder the Colorado Democrat who is considering a Presidential campaign said womens lobbyists in Washington were simply worn out Seven years of fighting to hold the line has not been fun she said adding that the battle against Judge Robert H Bork the Supreme Court nominee who could tip the balance against abortion will also be a difficult one What we need are some victories Noreen Connell president of the New York chapter of NOW and a candidate for its national presidency said the leadership had been focusing on defeating the far right while leaving a whole middle ground off the hook on such issues as equal opportunities in corporations and paid parental leave More Than Half Are Workers Meanwhile economic and social forces have widened the gap between the concerns of middleclass and poor women some feminists said More women are working last year 55 percent of women considered themselves part of the labor force as against 40 percent in 1966 the year of NOWs first convention But although there are many more women in the professions the majority still work in service and clerical jobs where the pay is lowest More women than ever are the sole support of families and an increasing number of these women are poor the Census Bureau reported in 1985 that 48 percent of the families living below the poverty level were headed by women up from a 30 percent share in 1966 While feminist economists and leaders have recognized this feminization of poverty they have so far been unable to win the greater childcare assistance and tougher child support laws they seek as a partial remedy Women Find Less Time One area of some progress is the equal pay for comparable worth issue Claudia Wayne executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity said that 36 states have begun at least to look at government jobs to insure that positions usually held by women are not unfairly undervalued in the salary scales Meanwhile the young middleclass women who might have joined in the marches and canvassing of the movements early years now find their energies consumed by families and new careers I remember when we all used to sit around in the suburbs and meet and talk and plot said one feminist Now there is no time for any of that And many goals the marchers sought 20 years ago have become accepted reality We are at the stage where the publics consciousness has advanced way beyond public policy said Char Mollison the executive director of the Womens Equity Action League The polls show  everyones polls  that the majority of American people think women

IN THE NATION; The Bork Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/18/opinion/in-the-nation-the-bork-question.html,Two old lions of the Washington bar and the Democratic Party have entered on different sides the steadily growing conflict over President Reagans nomination of Robert H Bork to replace Justice Lewis Powell on the Supreme Court That suggests something about how the battle will be fought Joseph L Rauh Jr a tireless and effective advocate of civil rights causes for as long as anyone this side of Strom Thurmond can remember laid down in a letter to the editor of The Washington Post the line likely to be followed by the nominees strongest opponents Judge Bork has made crystal clear his positions against minority rights womens rights criminal defendants rights churchstate separation one manone vote privacy generally and abortion choice in particular In an article for The New York Times on the same day Lloyd N Cutler formerly counsel to President Carter rejected that argument But he carefully refrained from taking an equally adamant stand on the other side stating instead the view that Judge Bork was neither an ideologue nor an extreme rightwinger either in his judicial philosophy or in his personal position on current social issues Mr Cutler is regarded as more centrist than Mr Rauh but he described himself as also a liberal Democrat and    an advocate of civil rights He said his view was based on long acquaintance and a study of the nominees published articles and opinions and he predicted that if confirmed by the Senate Judge Bork would be closer to the middle than the right and not far from the Justice he would replace That is not the judgment of some other studies published or in the works nor is it the conclusion of some legal scholars alarmed  for example  by what they consider Judge Borks insistence on sharply limiting access to the Federal courts But Mr Cutler seemed to be outlining a third position  favoring Judge Borks confirmation but not for the reasons that have led numerous rightwing groups and some senators to leap to his support One can fairly say Mr Cutler wrote that the confirmation is as much endangered by one extreme as the other No doubt he would consider Mr Rauhs view one of those extremes The other extreme would differ from it primarily in only one respect  that Judge Bork should be confirmed precisely because he fits Mr Rauhs description and therefore would provide the vote to swing the Supreme Court far to the right and keep it there for years to come Mr Cutler took the different tack of trying to justify the Bork nomination on grounds that Judge Bork is a moderate conservative in the mold of Lewis Powell  and even he suggested Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis That suggests that Judge Borks more moderate supporters probably including the White House  fear that fervent rightwing backing could be the kiss of death A Post editorial for example asked Who can imagine such an ogre in public life as the one described in Mr Rauhs letter To the extent moreover that those opposing the nomination can be pictured as the real ideological extremists Judge Borks case is likely to be strengthened Thats good reason for his opponents to watch their rhetoric and charges but not for them to avoid ideological questioning of the nominee After all if even one of Mr Rauhs descriptions of Judge Bork were to be supported by the record many Americans would consider him disqualified for the Supreme Court if any two or three of them should be sustained he would be so far on the fringe of judicial thought as to disqualify himself That is why the Judiciary Committee and the Senate have a duty to examine minutely Judge Borks beliefs as exemplified in his writings and his judicial opinions and to support or oppose him according to their judgment on the results  and not just because he may have no ethical or legal offenses on his record The question is not whether the judge is a liberal or a conservative As Lloyd Cutlers third position tacitly suggests the real question is whether Robert Bork is a radical whose crucial votes would so limit access to the courts and so restrict the courts ability to protect the rights of Americans as to vitiate their most vital function Does anyone seriously think the Senate should not satisfy itself on that point
Adult Bookstore Roils Lindenhurst,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/19/nyregion/adult-bookstore-roils-lindenhurst.html,WELLWOOD AVENUE in the heart of Lindenhurst with its icecream parlors and delicatessens the village hall funeral home church and railroad station all in the space of a few blocks gives the impression of Small Town USA But residents of this otherwise placid South Shore community are mobilizing for battle against what they see as the coming of 42d Street in Manhattan Adult Books a store selling erotic novelties magazines explicit videotapes and sexual paraphernalia opened for business in the northwest corner of Lindenhurst on June 2 Less than a week later about 150 villagers were marching in the stores driveway carrying signs saying Porn Is Satanic Porn Is Evil and Lindy Doesnt Need Porn The stores location on Sunrise Highway about a mile from the center of town is a point of contention between the owner Robert Scherer and the picketers Mr Scherer 25 years old of Farmingville said he chose the spot for the heavy traffic on the sixlane road and because the other businesses around including an oil company next door automotive dealers and just beyond the Lindenhurst boundary a quartermile down the road several topless bars suggested his would fit in But protesters mostly parents and elderly residents pointed to the houses just behind those stores saying that a number of children live there Maryann Daniels a mother of five lives behind Adult Books Im a mother a parent and Im scared she said Mrs Daniels said she was concerned about who frequents the store Some of the customers whom she described as mostly men middleaged are dressed real raunch she said I dont know what their intentions are when they leave the store she said Mr Scherer said that at least 60 percent of his mostly respectablelooking customers are married couples 10 to 15 percent are women and the rest are men I used to pump gas said Mr Scherer who now holds shares in three other Long Island businesses including one similar to Adult Books I saw more degenerates pumping gas than I see coming into this store The store owner also rejects residents concerns for their childrens welfare If they instill their morals in their children he said they dont have to worry about it Mr Scherer said he enforces a strict policy of selling only to those over 21 although state law sets the legal age at 18 The store has no windows and a sign on the blackedout front door says No Minors The picketers who came together as Concerned Residents Against Pornography also fear economic loss Margaret Corbe a Lindenhurst resident for 34 years said Hes going to do business at our expense Our property values are going to go down But according to Mr Scherer what he sells can be purchased at local lingerie stationery and video stores I didnt bring anything here that wasnt here already he said What we have is everything under one roof Village code enforcement officers charged Mr Scherer and his landlord Alfred Santaniello of Massapequa Park with six violations including operating an adult bookstore failure to obtain permits for the stores two large threefoothigh signs having no certificate of occupancy for the store and storing a trailer on the property without a permit Trial was set for Aug 12 but Mr Scherer said It looks like were going to process the paperwork and thats going to be it Lindenhurst Mayor Thomas H Kost agreed that Adult Books is not likely to be shut down through the courts saying that the First Amendments guarantee of free speech preempted the villages ban on such stores But the village has been involved in other ways The Mayor had assigned an auxiliary policeman to record the licenseplate numbers of the stores customers so protesters could write letters asking them not to patronize the store Mayor Kost said the officer was there only because there were going to be times when theres going to be harassment of either customers or protesters but the officer was reassigned when the Suffolk chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union became involved threatening a lawsuit I cant get into the situation where I jeopardize the village Mr Kost said To Mr Scherer private protest and public enforcement boil down to one thing My average customer is here for five minutes in and out he said What these people are trying to do is restrict what people can do in the privacy of their own home Mr Scherer said he is angry that not one person has come in and said what they find offensive Its just pornography as far as theyre concerned he said But none of them have ever walked through the door At a recent town meeting held at a senior citizens center members of Concerned Residents Against Pornography recalled picketing for months and finally getting two abortion clinics to leave Lindenhurst several years ago Resolved to fight the bookstore as long as it takes and to endure the heckling of passing motorists members planned a community rally for yesterday distributed fliers and divided up the foursquaremile village for canvassing People are waiting to see what happens with this mans business said one picketer who did not want to be identified If its accepted with no resistance theyll target Lindenhurst as a community thatll just lay down Mrs Daniels said Im afraid thesell catch on like the video stores Mr Scherer said he is willing to make some concessions to the protesters offering to tone down the signs to a less provocative name like Cupids Corner But he said he would not consider moving Were doing a heavy business he said He said he didnt know whether the pickets had helped or hurt him For now as picketers  their numbers down to about 30  march two or three times a week and the summer gets hotter Adult Books is the scene of an exercise in the First Amendment What gives them the right to be out there Mr Scherer said of the picketers is the same thing that gives us the right to be in here
WOMAN IN THE NEWS; NOW LEADER: BORN FEMINIST - MOLLY YARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/20/us/woman-in-the-news-now-leader-born-feminist-molly-yard.html,Molly Yard who was elected Saturday to guide the National Organization for Women through politically critical times described herself today as a born feminist and the spiritual descendant of Eleanor Roosevelt At a news conference this morning Ms Yard recounted the circumstances of her birth in China as the third daughter of Methodist missionaries there and said her upbringing there helped mold her feminist views My fathers male Chinese friends said that was a fate worse than death to have daughters and no sons she recalled They gave him a gift of commiseration a brass wash basin and I grew up in a society that devalued girls and women Efforts on NOWs Agenda Ms Yard who is in her 70s but steadfastly refuses to divulge her precise age is taking over as NOWs president as the 150000member organization enters its third decade On its agenda are determined efforts to block the confirmation of Judge Robert H Bork for a seat on the Supreme Court to insure the continuation of legalized abortion and to promote Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado for the Democatic nomination for President But Ms Yards election also comes at a time when some are questioning whether NOW represents a broad spectrum of American women many of whom are concerned with subtler and more personal issues like the family and career goals But her sweeping victory along with those of her running mates for vice president and secretary was interpreted here as approval by the NOW membership of the approach to public issues taken by the departing president Eleanor C Smeal who favored visible confrontational tactics Ms Yard vowed repeatedly during the threeday convention in the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel here that the organization would continue to be heard in the most public ways possible including street demonstrations Our first action will be to continue what has already been begun to stop the Bork confirmation Ms Yard said She also vowed that the group would picket the Vatican mission in Washington for five days starting on Aug 26 to protest the Vaticans position on abortion and birth control In October she added we will participate in a major way in a march for lesbian and gay rights But clearly in response to criticism of the groups past confrontational efforts she emphasized that NOW would be active on other fronts too filing lawsuits promoting legislation favorable to women working for the election of women at all levels of office and leading the bandwagon for the Mrs Schroeder candidacy 350000 for Schroeder On Saturday NOW members pledged more than 350000 to Mrs Schroeders campaign enough to qualify for Federal matching funds That Ms Yard said demonstrates the organizations clout and said volumes about where our heads and hearts are In addition to continuing Ms Smeals policies Ms Yard will apparently also follow her predecessors style As Ms Smeal does she speaks in ringing emotional tones In her final campaign speech she vowed to rally more than a million marchers on behalf of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution and in opposition to military spending and toxic waste She declared The only war we seek is the war to end poverty ignorance and disease Ms Yard is reticent about divulging details about her life A close associate said that although she had known Ms Yard for 30 years she knew little about her personal life Ms Yard was born Mary Alexander Yard but prefers to be called Molly She reminds many of the oldschool liberal activist of the Roosevelt era and indeed she described Eleanor Roosevelt as my second mother She said that in the 1930s she was a member of the American Student Union a radical organization that was critical of Roosevelts New Deal policies She said Eleanor Roosevelt called her once to discuss her criticisms Out of that we became close friends she said A Protest at Swarthmore After having been educated in China both by a tutor at home and later in the school system Ms Yard attended Swarthmore College graduating in 1933 It was there that she got her first taste of public protest After a Jewish student was denied admission to the sorority to which Ms Yard belonged she was so angered that she worked to abolish the sorority and fraternity structure on the campus After graduation and with the nation still in the throes of the Depression she became a social worker in Pennsylvania But she soon became disillusioned with the system and turned to political activism Through the years she has been active in trade union and civil rights causes and she was involved in efforts that led to the equal apportionment for men and women of delegate positions at the Democratic National ConventionI worked for years in the Democratic Party she said but as a woman I always felt left out of the process I never dreamed of going to the convention as a delegate for example Ms Yard was also active in Philadelphia politics serving in the early 1950s in the Democratic administrations of Mayor Joseph Clark Mrs Yard moved from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in 1953 and in 1956 she helped coordinate Mr Clarks campaign for the United States Senate She herself sought public office in 1964 winning the Democrat nomination for a seat on the state legislature but losing in the general election In the mid1970s she turned her efforts to NOW causes and became a key figure in the organizations campaign for ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment Securing a constitutional amendment remains the centerpiece of her program Before being elected president she served as NOWs political director She is also vice president of the Americans for Democratic Action Met Mao in China Since her childhood Ms Yard has returned to China twice the first time in 1938 when she met Mao Zedong and other leaders In June of this year she visited Beijing and presented leaders with a journal from her years in China Ms Yard a resident of Ligonier Pa has been married for 48 years to Sylvester Garrett a labor arbitrator They have two sons James a 43yearold assistant United States attorney in Pittsburgh and John 39 a doctoral candidate in forestry at the State University of New York at Syracuse and a daughter Joan GarrettGoodyear 45 a professor of English at Smith College They also have four grandchildren Few people at the convention were neutral about her candidacy Some said they were concerned that as a longtime friend of Ms Smeal and her close ally in the organizations frequently bitter internal politics Ms Yard would continue to run an autocratic administration and would be a surrogate for Ms Smeal Some also contended that her stirring rhetoric masked a lack of pragmatic strategy But the vote to elect her 940 to 629 and the comments made in meeting rooms and hallways indicated that those criticisms represented a minority view Alma Steed Fox a national board member from Pittsburgh and a longtime colleague in rights battles with Ms Yard said One reason I support her is that to a certain extent she will be a continuation of Ellie But she has a mind of her own too And she certainly will not be a quiet leader
BLACKMUN IS BEING TREATED FOR RECURRENCE OF PROSTATE CANCER,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/21/us/blackmun-is-being-treated-for-recurrence-of-prostate-cancer.html,Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun of the Supreme Court is undergoing treatment for a recurrence of prostate cancer at the Mayo Clinic and has an excellent prognosis the clinic said today amid speculation about the 78yearold justices medical condition A Court spokeswoman had said Friday in response to inquiries about Justice Blackmuns absence from a scheduled engagement in Colorado that he was recuperating from minor hernia surgery at his vacation home in northern Wisconsin There was no mention of prostate cancer on Friday Both the Mayo Clinic and Toni House the Court spokeswoman declined today to say when the clinic had found the prostate cancer or what kind of treatment Justice Blackmun was being given Diagnosed at Annual Examination Ms House did say that the diagnosis had occurred at an annual examination shortly after the Courts 19861987 term ended June 26 Justice Blackmuns prostate gland was removed because of cancer in November 1977 the Mayo Clinic reported at the time and reaffirmed today Meg Black a communications specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn declined to explain how prostate cancer could recur if the prostate had been removed Another expert said it was not unusual for microscopic cancer cells to be left behind in surrounding tissue after removal of the prostate gland Prostate cancer is relatively common in older men It can often be treated successfully but is sometimes fatal Ms House stressed that Justice Blackmun was working on Court business for the term that begins Oct 5 as well as on speeches But while the suggestion seemed to be that he was capable of returning to the bench then she said she had not been provided with any direct answers to questions about whether the prostate cancer might prompt Justice Blackmun to retire Justice Lewis F Powell Jr in retiring June 26 at the age of 79 cited his age and a series of health problems including prostate cancer surgery in 1985 that caused him to miss two months of the 19841985 term If Justice Blackmun were to retire it would raise the stakes even higher in and add new drama to the battle shaping up in the Senate over the future of the Court and in particular over President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to succeed Justice Powell Liberals are fighting to block Judge Bork in the Senate on the grounds that he could tip the balance of the Court decisively to the right and perhaps cement a majority for overruling the 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion Justice Blackmun was the author of the abortion decision and has been allied with the Courts liberals more often on a range of issues than has Justice Powell a centrist Treatment Called ShortTerm Todays press release by the Mayo Clinic said Justice Blackmun is currently a patient at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester On his routine annual examination a small and localized recurrence of prostatic carcinoma was detected The justice is undergoing treatment which is not incapacitating and is shortterm The prognosis according to Mayo Clinic physicians is excellent Dr William R Fair Chief of Urology at the MemorialSloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan said in a telephone interview this evening that if its a localized recurrence hed probably be able to live with that for a reasonably long time He said this meant years not weeks or months Dr Fair said that prostate cancers grow slowly and that if the only recurrence detected after 10 years was localized that was an encouraging sign that the cancer was not of the type likely to spread throughout the body The Mayo Clinic press release made no mention of hernia surgery But both Ms Black and Ms House said in response to questions today that Justice Blackmun did have minor hernia surgery as part of the same annual visit Ms Black said the hernia surgery had been on July 1 Questions about Justice Blackmuns health had begun circulating late last week when it was learned that he would not make his scheduled annual appearance at the summer conference in Colorado of the judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit He had been scheduled to speak there on Saturday On Friday in response to inquiries from reporters Ms House said that the Justices personal staff had reported that he was recuperating from minor hernia repair surgery at his vacation home and had been hospitalized for less than 30 hours She said then and reaffirmed today that he had been working on Court business and speeches and had gone swimming three times on Friday had bailed out his boat after rainstorms filled it with water had done some walking and had been trying to get in some vacation Both Ms House and Ms Black said they could provide no details about the minor hernia surgery Asked why the clinic would provide so few details Ms Black said Most likely at the patients request The Mayo Clinics press release at the time of Justice Blackmums prostate surgery in November 1977 said A malignant prostate gland was removed from Mr Justice Blackmun There was no spreading of the cancer The Justice has the same life expectancy of any other man his age The treatment for a recurrence of prostate cancer after removal of a malignant prostate could include radiation drug or hormonal therapy additional surgery or some combination

BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CRITICAL COMMENTS ON BORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/23/us/biden-defends-his-critical-comments-on-bork.html,Senator Joseph R Biden Jr attempting to recover his political equilibrium in the face of criticism that he has been too outspoken in opposing the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court said today that it would be dishonest for him to pretend he had an open mind The Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee as well as a Presidential candidate announced his opposition to Judge Bork shortly after President Reagan made the nomination Mr Biden has found himself on the political defensive ever since criticized for opposing a nominee who has not yet had a chance to state his case At a luncheon meeting with reporters Senator Biden said he recognized the political perils both for himself and his party in a prolonged confirmation fight He said that while his initial comments might have been hasty he had no regrets about leading the opposition and saw little point in blunting his conviction that Judge Bork would shift the Supreme Court in the wrong direction I dont have an open mind he said The reason I dont is that I know this man He said he first became familiar with Judge Borks conservative legal philosophy in law school and has more recently compiled two notebooks of the legal writing of the judge who is on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Knowledge Is Not Peripheral My knowledge of his record is not peripheral Senator Biden said For me to stand before all of you and say that I have no view of where I stand on Bork would be dishonest The Senators tone was rueful and somewhat defensive He said he knew he had been criticized for meeting with a coalition of civil rights groups opposed to the nomination I did not pander to the civil rights groups he said adding that he invited them to his office to tell them that he planned to conduct a fair hearing and that he would not delay a vote He said he should be held to account not for his own position but for whether Im conducting the hearings fairly and give everyone a chance The Judiciary Committee hearings will begin Sept 15 Senator Biden said he had second thoughts only about the timing of his initial comments about Judge Bork which he said gave the false impression that he had not made a considered judgment The timing was a mistake he told a meeting of state Democratic leaders last weekend in Cleveland Today he said I dont regret any statement I made about Judge Bork What I regret is the timing with which I said them It was more a PR mistake than a substantive mistake Senator Biden said that when he decided this year that he could both run a Presidential campaign and serve as chairman of the Judiciary Committee he knew there was a chance that he might become embroiled in a contentious fight over a Supreme Court vacancy A Prospect of Party Damage The one thing that could be the most troublesome has happened he said Senator Biden said there were 10 or 12 major issues on which Democrats would oppose Judge Bork ranging from free speech to antitrust law But he said it was possible that the debate would focus on abortion and affirmative action a prospect he said would be damaging to the party The danger would come not from the issues themselves he said because the nation is overwhelming against Ronald Reagan on his social agenda Rather he said it would be damaging for Republicans to be able to portray the Democrats as the party of special interests a singleinterest vehicle Senator Biden said the Senate was almost evenly split on the nomination at this point He said that if a majority of the Judiciary Committee was opposed to Judge Bork the vote would probably be to send the nomination to the full Senate with a negative recommendation In that case he said he hoped the Reagan Administration would withdraw the nomination but he conceded that a prolonged floor fight was a more likely scenario He said he had not yet decided whether to take part in a filibuster against the nomination
"If High Court Is So Political, Let's Elect Justices",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/23/opinion/l-if-high-court-is-so-political-let-s-elect-justices-606687.html,To the Editor Robert H Bork was a senior professor for many years at Yale Law School He was Solicitor General of the United States for four years He has been a Federal judge for five years And Senator Edward M Kennedy and the liberal Democrats consider him unfit to be a Supreme Court Justice Judge Borks credentials for the Supreme Court are equal to those of anyone appointed to it in this century including the liberal gods of Louis D Brandeis Felix Frankfurter and William O Douglas His credentials are immensely superior to Earl Warrens when he was appointed So it all comes down to leftright ideology as Senator Kennedys criterion for appointment irrespective of record in the legal profession This inspires these considerations  The Supreme Court was if anything to the right of the national political consensus at least outside the South from the 1850s to the socalled Roosevelt revolution on the Court in the late 1930s when Franklin Roosevelt took advantage of vacancies to establish a strongly leftwing majority President Eisenhower did not alter this he may have intended to but was outfoxed by Warren and President Nixon did so only marginally Senator Kennedy thinks the leftist domination of the Court ought to be perpetual There is nothing in the Constitution or the Courts history to mandate this conclusion Senator Kennedy seems to believe the political situation ought to determine Supreme Court appointments  unless there is a conservative in the White House  The men who drafted the Constitution in Philadelphia 200 years ago would probably have been surprised at the immense power the Supreme Court has arrogated to itself in the last halfcentury so that freedom to obtain abortions on demand and to sell pornography to children has been effected by judicial rather than legislative or executive decision There is no need to stand by the intentions of the framers of the Constitution any more than men now walk around in wigs and breeches Possibly indeed probably the time has come to recognize the politicization of the Supreme Court and have the Justices elected every four or six years on party tickets That Judge Borks nomination could be considered repugnant to liberal Democrats like Senator Kennedy indicates how deeply polarized this country is along leftright ideological lines which the IranContra hearings would readily make clear if our media both print and broadcast were not 85 percent dominated by the left NORMAN F CANTOR New York July 2 1987 The writer is affiliated professor of legal history at New York University School of Law

Bork opponents concede his intelligence and competence and will thus have to contest the nomination on philosophical grounds Over all the telephone survey of 745 adults on Tuesday and Wednesday

in part because the individual members of the Court appear to be distant figures to most Americans Only 26 percent of those polled for example had an opinion of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist And only 25 percent had an opinion of Justice Thurgood Marshall who has been on the Court for 20 years Moreover the public is closely divided on the philosophical issues underlying the Bork debate Thirtysix percent said they considered the Court too liberal but 38 percent said it was too conservative Fortythree percent said the Court had gone too far in protecting the rights of people accused of crimes but 41 percent said it had not On Judge Bork himself only 23 percent expressed a view 11 percent said they had a favorable opinion of him 12 percent an unfavorable opinion The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points But on what is likely to emerge as a central question in the nomination struggle a clear majority 62 percent said that senators should pay a lot of attention to a nominees positions on major constitutional issues in considering whether to confirm him Thirtyone percent said the Senate should pay little or no attention to a nominees judicial philosophy Bitter Debate in Senate This emerged as a central theme in a bitter Senate debate on Judge Bork yesterday set off by a speech in which Senator Joseph R Biden Jr the chairman of the Judiciary Committee vigorously defended the Senates right to examine a nominees philosophy Mr Biden a Delaware Democrat who is a candidate for President said that the Founding Fathers had intended the broadest role for the Senate in choosing the Court and checking the President in every way In contrast Senator Bob Dole Republican of Kansas also a candidate for President said that for the Senate to require that judicial candidates pledge allegiance to the political and ideological views of particular senators or interest groups would lead to paralyzing the Senate in a gridlock of competing interest groups each hawking its own agenda In the poll support for the Senates right to examine a nominees judicial philosophy spanned partisan and ideological lines Sixtyfive percent of Democrats said the Senate should pay a lot of attention to a nominees positions on constitutional issues and so did 63 percent of Republicans 64 percent of liberals and 61 percent of conservatives felt this way Issue of Judicial Philosophy An even larger share of all those surveyed 72 percent said that the President should pay a lot of attention to a potential nominees judicial philosophy in deciding whom to name to the Court When the responses to the two questions on the President and the Senate were combined a majority 54 percent said that both the President and the Senate should pay heed to a nominees views on constitutional matters The one nonphilosophical issue that many Democrats have raised is Judge Borks dismissal of the special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the Watergate scandal Even this however has not registered in the memory of the broad public Sixtynine percent of those surveyed said they could not recall enough about the incident to have an opinion of it Of those who remembered 16 percent disapproved of what Judge Bork did while 8 percent approved Opinions on whether the Supreme Court has been too liberal or too conservative generally followed partisan lines But one striking finding of the survey was a sharp division along generational lines as well with younger Americans more likely than older ones to view the Court as too conservative Among Americans 44 years of age or less 47 percent said that the Court had been too conservative while 36 percent said it had been too liberal But among those 45 and older 25 percent said it had been too conservative while 36 percent said the Court had been too liberal Shift on Rights of Suspects On one of the central disputes between liberals and conservatives the rights of criminal suspects the survey indicated that public views had become more conservative in the last year In a TimesCBS News Poll taken in June 1986 34 percent said the Supreme Court had gone too far in protecting the rights of people accused of crimes In the current survey that figure was 43 percent The survey found the public in narrow agreement with Judge Bork on another key question surrounding his nomination affirmative action The survey asked Do you believe that where there has been job discrimination against blacks in the past preference in hiring or promotion should be given to blacks today Fortypercent favored giving preference to blacks 53 percent opposed preferences Not surprisingly opinions on this question broke sharply along racial lines 77 percent of blacks favored preferential employment as against 34 percent of whites Judge Bork has been critical of affirmative action programs and his nomination is being opposed by many leading civil rights groups While most blacks surveyed like most whites had yet to form opinions on Judge Borkthose who had opinions split about 4to1 against him The survey found the public closely divided on another issue central to the debate over Judge Bork abortion Asked if they favored or opposed the Courts ruling that a woman may go to a doctor to end her pregnancy at any time during the first three months of pregnancy 52 percent said they favored the ruling while 41 percent said they opposed it Bork Stand on Abortion Judge Bork has said that the Supreme Court went too far in its Roe v Wade decision which legalized abotion nationwide by striking down state laws against it The survey like yesterdays Senate row over the nomination foreshadowed the possibility that the fight could have a substantial impact on 1988 politics For example the tendency of younger people to view the Court as already too conservative could prove to be an asset for the Democrats if their party becomes clearly identified with opposition to a conservative jurist  Democrats had been losing ground among the young because of President Reagans broad popularity with people under 30 On the other hand as part of a campaign to make the Supreme Court more conservative Republicans had hoped that the nomination would reinforce their partys growing strength among white Southerners Here though the evidence was mixed Asked if the Court had been too liberal or too conservative 40 percent of white Southerners said it had been too liberal but almost as many 35 percent said it had been too conservative On Judge Bork white Southerners who had an opinion split closely 14 were favorably inclined toward him 11 percent viewed him unfavorably While the poll found relatively few firm opinions about either Chief Justice Rehnquist or Justice Marshall both were popular among those with opinions Eighteen percent had a favorable view of Chief Justice Rehnquist while 8 percent had an unfavorable opinion For Justice Marshall it was 20 percent favorable and 4 percent unfavorable Justice Marshall the only black member of the Court was viewed favorably by 35 percent of blacks unfavorably by 1 percent JUDGING JUSTICES SHOULD THEIR OPINIONS COUNT When Senators decide how to vote on confirming a presidents

New Views Emerge Of Bork's Role in Watergate Dismissals,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/us/new-views-emerge-of-bork-s-role-in-watergate-dismissals.html,Fourteen years after the immense drama of the Saturday Night Massacre the handling of that constitutional crisis amid the Watergate scandals is emerging as an issue that could shape the emotional constitutional questions of today That is because the man in the middle on the night of Oct 20 1973 Robert H Bork is now President Reagans nominee to fill a critical swing seat on the Supreme Court Whoever fills that seat may have the power to change national policy on issues ranging from race relations to abortion As the Senate ponders the way Mr Bork handled that earlier role among other issues in the confirmation battle to come it is likely to find that his consuming interest was not protecting President Nixons weakening grip on office as some foes charged immediately or protecting the Justice Department from chaos as he has suggested or any of the larger issues of the day Instead Mr Bork was apparently preoccupied with a point of law whether Archibald Cox who as Watergate special prosecutor was ostensibly a Justice Department official had a legal right to mount a court challenge against the President and whether the President had the legal authority to dismiss him for doing so Underlying the struggle were fundamental questions of governance Did the special prosecutor have the right to subpoena the Presidents secret tape recordings Did the special prosecutor have authority to challenge a President Would Elliot L Richardson whose own confirmation as Attorney General had been achieved by his promise to appoint Mr Cox discharge his old law professor at Mr Nixons urging If he would not would someone else And finally was Mr Nixon trying to hide his complicity in the coverup of the breakin to Democratic National Committee headquarters by burglars linked to the White House Mr Richardson and his deputy William D Ruckelshaus refused to obey White House orders and quit or were discharged Mr Bork who began that fateful Saturday as Solicitor General the thirdranking officer in the Justice Department went along Judge Bork has said he dismissed Mr Cox in order to hold the Justice Department together by sparing it from a long succession of resignations and to continue the Watergate investigation at a time when the alternative might have been chaos But what other participants in the episode remember about Mr Borks performance is what they describe as his singleminded almost obsessive concern about an issue of legal procedure rather than the substance of Mr Coxs investigation of the President Character Flaws Or Honest Assessment Memories of the affair have faded somewhat since that night but Judge Borks critics maintain that this episode reveals character flaws that go beyond their objections to his views on specific issues It is what they allege is a narrowness of vision and reverence for executive authority as much as his dismissal of Mr Cox that these critics say makes him unsuitable for the Supreme Court But Judge Borks defenders including some who believe he should not have discharged Mr Cox dispute this view Philip A Lacovara a Washington lawyer who was counsel to Mr Cox said Mr Bork based his decision to follow the Presidents orders on an honest assessment of the legal issues He made a choice that was within the range of reason even though in my view it was not the correct choice Mr Lacovara said But it was not one that reflected evil motives or a fundamental misunderstanding of constitutional law A series of interviews with people involved in the massacre has offered new insights into Mr Borks legal philosophy and approach to the law in this tense period an approach that his collegues at the Justice Department believe was shaped largely by the views of his mentor at Yale University Alexander M Bickel Indeed both critics and supporters of the Bork nomination see some irony in so much turning on 24 hours in the life of a man who is now 60 years old The episode began on Oct 19 1973 the Friday before the dismissal of Mr Cox Mr Nixon had refused to accept the order by a Federal appeals court to surrender nine tape recordings of conversations in the White House Some of the tapes were later found to substantially corroborate allegations that the President participated in a coverup of the breakin that took place over a year earlier at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex here Life Goes On As the Crisis Looms That night recalls Ralph K Winter a Federal appellate judge then a Yale Law School professor who was visting Mr Bork and his wife in Washington the Solicitor General was on the phone several times with Mr Richardson but clearly there was no talk of resignation or impending crisis Saturday morning Mr Winter flew to Hot Springs Va to give a speech while his wife Claire and their children went to the zoo Mr Bork he recalls said he was going to the office for a while and then planned to watch a Penn State football game on television Meanwhile Mr Richardson was making a final attempt at a compromise between the President and the special prosecutor that would accommodate Mr Coxs need for additional White House materials But there was no middle ground left At 1 PM Mr Cox appeared at a nationally televised news conference at the National Press Club to defy the President openly He said he intended to go about my duties on the terms of which I assumed them One of those duties he said would be to bring to the courts attention what seems to me to be noncompliance with the courts orders Back at the Justice Department Mr Richardson and Mr Ruckelshaus watched Mr Coxs performance and concluded that it would probably mean the White House would insist on dismissing him for insubordination It had been been clear in my mind for a couple of days that I wouldnt do it Mr Ruckelshaus said last week of the dismissal of Mr Cox And when it became clear to both Elliot and me that the President was going forward with his determination to fire Cox we both sort of simultaneously said Whos next And it was clear then that Bork was the next in line As they feared at 220 PM  Alexander M Haig Jr then the White House chief of staff called Mr Richardson and told him to fire Cox The Attorney General refused and asked to see the President While the Attorney General waited for a summons to the White House he discussed the remaining options with Mr Ruckelshaus and Mr Bork Matters of Principle Vs Questions of Law My recollection Mr Ruckelshaus said is that Mr Bork ultimately decided that the President had the power to fire Cox and he had the right to ask him to be the instrument of that power He had no personal scruples against firing Cox An important element in Mr Borks decision Mr Ruckelshaus added may have been his ignorance of important details of the tapes dispute He didnt have any of that information he didnt have any of the flavor the feel of what had been building up over several months so his perception of what he was being asked to do was much different from mine and Elliots Mr Ruckelshaus said But even though Mr Bork had been largely removed from the unfolding events his views on the role of the special prosecutor were well known within the Justice Department according to several officials Indeed an important strain of Mr Borks views for many years had been his strong sense of deference to authority in particular Presidential authority What is most striking to me about Judge Bork is that he is an advocate of disproportionate powers for the executive branch of Government almost executive supremecy and his handling of Watergate seems to fits that pattern said William L Taylor a Washington lawyer who is an official at the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights an advocacy group that is opposed to Mr Borks nomination The deference to the President included a distaste for the notion that a special prosecutor a member of the executive branch could operate outside Presidential authority Judge Borks former associates said Bork had a genuine intellectual objection to this whole arrangement and this really offended his view of the way things ought to be said Richard K Darman a former Reagan Administration official who was a senior aide to Mr Richardson Mr Richardson agreed I think that as a matter of principle Cox should not have been fired he said He said he never thought of it as a legal question as Mr Bork apparently did The Role of a Mentor Writings of Bickel Mr Richardson said he felt that while no one doubted Mr Cox was acting consistent with his charter the special prosecutor was also refusing to carry out instructions I thought Bork was simply taking the position that the President was entitled to have him fired for that reason Mr Richardson said Mr Borks views of the role of the special prosecutor in investigating the President were hardly novel and in fact had been widely discussed in legal and academic circles through the writings of Professor Bickel of the Yale Law School then one of the nations foremost constitutional scholars In September a month before the massacre Professor Bickel whom Mr Bork has described as his best friend wrote an article for The New Republic called The Tapes Cox Nixon In it he argued that the courts should not be called upon to take sides in the dispute between Mr Cox and the President Mr Cox has no constitutional or otherwise legal existence except as he is a creature of the Attorney General who is a creature of the President Professor Bickel wrote To the extent therefore that the Presidents adversary is Mr Cox the President is litigating with himself He is suing himself and defending himself against himself Thus in Professor Bickels view the President could order Mr Cox to desist from his demands at any time and remove him if he refused The article which became known as the Bickel option was widely read in the White House and the Justice Department and added fuel to speculation that Mr Cox would be discharged At 320 PM General Haig called back and told the Attorney General to come over Mr Richardson tendered his resignation About an hour later Mr Richardson returned to his office where several of his aides had gathered A secretary said General Haig was calling for Mr Ruckelshaus and the Deputy Attorney General took the private elevator down to his office on the floor below to take the call General Haig said the President wanted him to discharge the special prosecutor I thought what the President was doing was fundamentally wrong Mr Ruckelshaus recalled I was convinced that Cox had only been doing what he had the authority to do what was really of concern to the President and the White House was that he was too close He hadnt engaged in any extraordinary improprities quite the contrary Mr Ruckelshaus wrote out a letter of resignation but the White House did not wait to receive it before announcing that he had been dismissed Upstairs that left Mr Bork the Acting Attorney General He pondered the order he was about to receive and considered resigning I was thinking of resigning not out of moral considerations Mr Bork said in an interview later that year I did not want to be perceived as a man who did the Presidents bidding to save my job Mr Richardson and Mr Ruckelshaus concerned about the continuity of their department both urged him not to leave We thought his leadership of the department was going to be critically important in a situation of enormous stress Mr Richardson said And we were genuinely alarmed by the possibility that if Ruckelshauss resignation and my resignation was followed by a chain reaction we could end up with the chief of the messenger service as Acting Attorney General Ouster Ruled Illegal After the Fact Mr Bork went down in the elevator to Mr Ruckelshauss office and spoke on the telephone to General Haig who said he was sending a White House limousine for him At the White House after being designated Acting Attorney General Mr Bork sent Mr Cox a twoparagraph letter of dismissal When Mr Bork returned home later that night Mr Winter recalled his mood was gloomy He was fully aware of the controversy about to ensue Mr Winter said In fact a member of his staff called to congratulate him on becoming Acting Attorney General Mr Winter added And I recall Bob wryly telling the staff member that he did not think under the circumstances congratulations were in order Indeed news that Mr Bork had dismissed Mr Cox on the Presidents orders brought a storm of criticism In the next 10 days more than 300000 telegrams were received by Congress and the White House most calling for Mr Nixons resignation The outcry was so sustained and fierce that the following Monday the White House announced that it had decided after all to turn over the tapes to the new special prosecutor For his part Judge Bork has insisted that he made the right decision in dismissing Mr Cox The President and Mr Cox had gotten themselves without my aid into a position of confrontation Judge Bork has said There was never any question that Mr Cox one way or another was going to be discharged At that point you would have had massive resignations from the top levels of Justice If that had happened Judge Bork continued the Department of Justice would have lost its top leadership all of it and would I think have effectively been crippled Mr Borks dismissal of the special prosecutor was challenged in a suit filed by Ralph Nader the consumer advocate among others On Nov 14 1973 Federal District Judge Gerhard A Gesell ruled that the dismissal of Mr Cox in the absence of a finding of extraordinary impropriety as specified in the regulation establishing the special prosecutors office was illegal The Justice Department did not appeal the ruling and because Mr Cox indicated that he did not want his job back the issue was considered moot
BORK AT YALE: COLLEGUES RECALL A FRIEND BUT A PHILOSOPHICAL FOE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/27/us/bork-at-yale-collegues-recall-a-friend-but-a-philosophical-foe.html,Harry H Wellington professor and former dean at Yale Law School longtime faculty colleague and nextdoor neighbor here of Robert H Bork recalled the day he heard of his friends nomination to the Supreme Court My initial reaction was one of absolute joy he said This is a terrific person really a spectacular person a wonderful human being And then I realized that I dont agree with him on things  a lot of things The Bork nomination has presented a lot of former Yale colleagues and students  mainly moderates and liberals who disagree profoundly with Judge Borks constitutional philosophy with an occasion to reminisce about the impression he made in 15 years at Yale in two stints beginning in 1962 It also puts some of those asked to comment or testify on whether he should be confirmed in a difficult position Many described him fondly in interviews as a decent vibrant and devastatingly witty man a complex and powerful intellect tempered by a fine sense of humor a warm friend a stimulating teacher wreathed in a cloud of cigarette smoke who could be cutting with people he did not know or did not respect Former colleagues and students also recalled the bearded 60yearold jurist as a formidable advocate of his view that the Supreme Court has usurped legislative powers in dozens of activist decisions since the 1920s They said he was enamoured of general theories often carried them to the limits of their logic and blasted away at opponents positions with an air of certitude that some called dogmatism But they noted that he had been persuaded to change his mind about some very fundamental issues although not lately that he relished the thrust and parry of intellectual debate and that he had been fair in grading student papers that challenged his basic philosophy head on One former student who disagrees with much of Judge Borks philosophy said He is the most formidable intellect I have ever encountered Another said he was not the deepest mind he had known  tending to dismiss telling counterarguments with clever quips rather than acknowledging their legitimacy and coming to grips with them  but surely one of the quickest and sharpest Ralph K Winter a Federal appellate judge former Yale law professor and fellow conservative called his friend Judge Bork the most important scholar in antitrust law since the passage of the Sherman Act in 1890 Liberals at Yale conceded Judge Borks stature and influence if not his correctness as an antitrust scholar But some said his muchquoted writings on constitutional law while probing and provocative enough to have spurred a conservative movement under the banner judicial restraint were internally inconsistent and incompletely thought through as well as being in their view dead wrong Professors Quandary On the Nomination So how will Harry Wellington and other moderatetoliberal Yale law professors deal with the Senate confirmation battle over their esteemed former colleagues nomination which some consider a threat to their most cherished ideals Some will oppose it Some will support it And some who feel very ambivalent in Mr Wellingtons words will try not to get involved Although Mr Wellington has been asked by both opponents and supporters to consider testifying he said Ive made a firm decision not to do anything  now Most law professors at Yale and around the nation consider Judge Borks views to be rather far to the right on the spectrum of respectable legal thought Many of them note however that they themselves are to the left of the general publics political center of gravity so that Judge Bork may be closer to the political mainstream than to the legal mainstream Guido Calabresi dean of Yale Law School a liberal and a close friend of Judge Borks said he cringes at the nominees views on some civil liberties issues and was concerned that he ignores the significance of discrimination in America But Dean Calabresi added I expect to support him because of his personal integrity because of his professional quality and because while I have very strong disagreements with him I have no reason to believe that anybody else that this Administration would nominate and get confirmed would be any better in terms of those disagreements and would probably be worse On the other hand Prof Burke Marshall who was the Kennedy Administrations top civil rights lawyer said that although he liked Judge Bork and had valued him as a colleague if anybody asks me I expect to be opposed very vigorously to his nomination He explained Based on what Ive read of his and what I know of his personality I judge the man to be convinced in his positions and I view his positions as wrong and inconsistent with at least three decades  I think I could fairly say five decades  of judicial history in the Supreme Court Professor Marshall said Judge Borks blunt attacks on Supreme Court precedents ranging from the onemanonevote rulings to the abortion decisions reflected an intellectual arrogance that is not shakable Other liberal Yale law professors who some predict will oppose Judge Borks nomination include Owen M Fiss his successor as the Alexander M Bickel Professor of Public Law a special chair endowed in the memory of the renowned scholar who was Judge Borks best friend and Paul Gewirtz Some Vignettes From the Yale Years Among the vignettes from Judge Borks years at Yale that former colleagues and students recalled were these  He was the only member of the faculty who voted for Barry Goldwater for President in 1964  or at least the only nontenured member who admitted it Judge Winter recalled with a laugh  In a 1978 faculty debate Judge Bork was a vocal opponent of a proposal eventually adopted to bar from the schools recruiting facilities employers that discriminated against homosexuals he said the faculty should not ratify homosexuality which he said was obviously not an unchangeable condition like race or gender  Teaching his constitutional law seminar in 1982 Judge Bork referred disparagingly to judges from the white wine and cheese and Volvo set who wrote uppermiddleclass values into the Constitution he dismissed a leading scholars book defending the Warren Courts liberal activism with a kind of contemptuous snort one student recalled as if to say how could it possibly be justified   When President Nixon opened relations with China and downgraded relations with Taiwan in 1972 Dean Calabresi recalled Mr Bork came into the faculty lounge one day and said with characteristic bluntness  Well theres one thing about our President  when he sells out our friends he sure moves the goods   After Mr Nixon appointed him Solicitor General in 1973 and he himself had dismissed the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox on the Presidents orders Mr Bork was deeply hurt when some former colleagues denounced him without first asking his reasons  His antitrust law course was facetiously called protrust by students a reference to his arguments that many judicial constraints on big business mergers and other practices impede rather than promote competition and consumer welfare Robert Bork started teaching law at Yale in 1962 at the age of 35 pursuing an intellectual interest in the law after several years as a successful antitrust lawyer with a large Chicago firm Dean Calabresi recalled When he came on he immediately made an impact because he was so bright and ornery in terms of being willing to argue with everybody about everything He loved to sit around with people in the faculty lounge and argue Governments Role A Libertarian View Mr Bork was then an aggressive libertarian conservative that is keep the Government out of everything Dean Calabresi recalled He was influenced by a strong commitment to freemarket economics That period was marked by among other things a 1963 New Republic article in which he passionately denounced proposed legislation later passed to bar racial discrimination by owners of restaurants hotels and other public accommodations He said the notion that the majoritys disapproval of white racism justified such a restriction on individual liberty was a principle of unsurpassed ugliness Although Mr Bork recanted this article in 1973 it displayed what Dean Calabresi and others view as a stilltroublesome lack of empathy for the victims of discrimination in America But he Mr Wellington and others stressed that in his personal conduct Mr Bork was deeply opposed to racism and bigotry Mr Borks views moved away from libertarianism in part because of the influence of Professor Bickel a leading advocate of judicial restraint who moved from political liberalism toward traditionalist conservatism before his death in 1974 They had ferocious intellectual debates while teamteaching a constitutional law seminar students recall Judge Bork said of Mr Bickel in a July 7 interview He was a delightful witty urbane man We disagreed on most things but over time our views began to converge I mean I convinced him of some things and he convinced me of some things I had thought it was possible to work out a theory of when governmental regulation of human beings is permissible and on the other hand when individual freedom is required Alex thought that was wrong that such a theory could never be worked out and after a period of years of teaching it with him I became convinced he was right That was about 1970 When the State Began to Reign At that point Mr Borks views on the role of the judiciary in governing society evolved toward a far more restrictive theory of judicial review and a far more exalted view of the powers of the state over individuals This shift was apparent in his changing view of the Supreme Courts 1965 decision in Griswold v Connecticut which struck down a law making it a crime even for married couples to use contraceptives In a 1969 article he criticized the Courts reasoning but found the outcome justifiable suggesting that moral disapproval alone cannot be accepted as a sufficient rationale for any coercion by the state But in 1971 Mr Bork denounced the decision as utterly specious unprincipled and intellectually empty calling it a typical decision of the Warren Court Never bashful about challenging established law Mr Bork went on Courts must accept any value choice the legislature makes unless it clearly runs contrary to a choice made in framing the Constitution It follows of course that broad areas of constitutional law ought to be reformulated He proceeded to attack more than a score of Supreme Court decisions over several decades including those protecting nonpolitical speech requiring state legislative reapportionment on a one man one vote principle holding racially restrictive real estate clauses unenforceable and protecting convicts rights not to be sterilized He has held to the 1971 articles rejection of his previous position on legislating morality In ruling in 1984 that the Constitution does not protect homosexual conduct Judge Bork said the right of the majority to legislate morality was the very predicate of democratic government Ronald Dworkin who was for a time a Yale faculty colleague of Mr Borks commented in a recent article on his opposition in 1963 to public accommodation laws  a view based on libertarian philosophy  and his 1984 opposition to homosexual rights  based on a rejection of that same philosophy Mr Dworkin speculated in the New York Review of Books Perhaps Borks convictions did shift so dramatically over time But it is hard to resist a less attractive conclusion that his principles adjust themselves to the prejudices of the right however inconsistent these might be Return to Yale Change and Death Mr Bork was absent from Yale from 1973 until 1977 when he worked in Washington as Solicitor General and for a time as Acting Attorney General After leaving the Government he completed his major scholarly work a 1978 book called The Antitrust Paradox a wideranging and highly influential attack on prevailing antitrust doctrine When Mr Bork returned to Yale things were not the same Mr Bickel had died of cancer Mr Borks first wife Claire was in the final stage of a debilitating 10year battle against cancer It was hard for him Mr Wellington recalled The school was a very different place The institution had changed and he had changed probably even more Mr Bork spent a lot of time at home developing an outside law practice and caring for his wife with what several former colleagues called extraordinary devotion After she died in 1980 he decided it was time to leave Mr Bork went back to Washington in 1981 to practice law with a large firm President Reagan nominated him within a few months to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and everyone understood this was a possible steppingstone to the Supreme Court
"WASHINGTON TALK: ANTI-ABORTION POLICY; Mincing No Words, or Pictures, on Birth Control",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/29/us/washington-talk-anti-abortion-policy-mincing-no-words-pictures-birth-control.html,Even in Washington a city where causes are constantly in collision the posters seem shocking A typical one seen on buses and in subway stations next to advertisements for designer jeans and lowfat yogurt shows an African peasant clutching a starving child to her breast The legend above her reads The rightwing fanatics have picked their next target This campaign is aimed not at some renegade military dictatorship but at the United States Agency for International Development and the White House And it is being waged by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America which has received nearly 200 million from AID over the past 16 years and has been described by officials of the agency as creative effective and efficient Faye Wattleton the president of Planned Parenthood conceded The ads are hardhitting theyre meant to be Jay F Morris the acting director of AID contended The ads are extreme and malicious A Policy on Federal Grants Their conflict was set off by a policy of the Reagan Administration requiring that private familyplanning organizations as a condition for further Federal grants must sign a pledge not to give financial or other support to any programs abroad that perform or advocate abortion or even advise women on the procedure The policy will affect Planned Parenthood in December when its current 89 million fiveyear agreement with AID expires Since that figure represents 95 percent of the organizations overseas budget Ms Wattleton said by next year the organization will be unable to continue providing the family planning services that are now received by 14 million people in 41 countries much less expand the program to reach millions more who may need and want it Ms Wattleton said Planned Parenthood could not comply with the Administrations pledge requirement even if it wanted to because it has neither the authority nor the right to impose opinions on the hospitals clinics private and government programs it assists in undeveloped countries For every person that Reagan can convince that abortion is wrong we wish them well Ms Wattleton said But people should not be punished for not accepting the Administrations point of view For his part Mr Morris said Abortion can and should be severed from family planning We have 800 contractors in 70 countries that have adapted to this policy without difficulty Campaign Aimed at Congress Ms Wattleton says President Reagan and other key Administration officials are insisting on a strict policy abroad to placate antiabortion groups whose members are unhappy that Mr Reagan after seven years in office still has not outlawed abortion at home She hopes that by intensifying the mostly local poster campaign Planned Parenthood can win the support of members of Congress and other Washington decisionmakers for new legislation that would neutralize AIDs attempt to exclude abortion from the range of family planning options available in third world countries To that end Ms Wattleton is to testify Thursday before a Senate subcommittee that deals with foreign aid appropriations as well as before other panels in the months ahead The battle between Planned Parenthood and AID is almost internecine Planned Parenthoods overseas division Family Planning International Assistance was created in 1971 at the request of AID and it has received 190 million from the Government agency since then In 1973 an amendment sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina was added to the Foreign Assistance Act forbidding the use of Federal funds to finance abortions abroad But not until 1984 did the Administration announce at an international family planning conference in Mexico City that it was adopting the far more restrictive policy of also requiring private organizations receiving Federal funds to dissociate themselves from overseas projects that used money from other sources for abortionrelated activities At first Planned Parenthood tried to negotiate what became known as the Mexico City policy to see if there was any flexibility Ms Wattleton said About a year and a half ago when it became clear that the Administration was not going to budge the organization started a Congressional lobbying effort and at about the same time the posters attacking extremists in the White House and the Agency for International Development went up on Washington buses and in subway stations particularly around Foggy Bottom where AID offices and the State Department are situated The advertisements also ran in the major newspapers read in the capital In some of those ads Senator Helms and M Peter McPherson AIDs director were singled out by name In New York last January Planned Parenthood also filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the policy on the ground that it represented an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech and association Soon after posters went up in Washington showing a peasant woman with two emaciated infants and the words Why were suing Peter McPherson Mr McPherson has since been named Deputy Treasury Secretary and he is planning to leave AID after his confirmation to that post In any case Ms Wattleton said the campaigns focus in the future will be more on Mr Reagan and his staff and less on the aid agency whose employees she said have no alternative but to carry out Administration policy whatever their personal views on family planning and abortion The organization has spent 15 million on the campaign and lobbying effort so far spokesmen said All Options Except Abortions But Mr Morris does not sound like someone who is going along with the policy reluctantly Reagan has spent more on voluntary family planning than Johnson Nixon and Carter combined he said We just believe that family planning means to prevent rather than terminate life AID he added does support the use of birth control pills condoms diaphragms the rhythm method and other means of birth control The largest part of our program he said is voluntary sterilization with informed consent Essentially we favor all options except abortions and to make abortion the linchpin and the issue worldwide is ludicrous It seems unlikely that the dispute will be amicably resolved While continuing and even intensifying the public campaign Planned Parenthood officials will also lobby Congress for legislation that would kill the policy One legislative approach being drafted would make it illegal for the Administration to impose restrictions on private organizations that distribute foreign aid without also imposing the same restrictions on foreign countries that receive foreign aid Among Planned Parenthoods key allies in Congress are Senator Nancy L Kassebaum Republican of Kansas Senator Claiborne Pell Democrat of Rhode Island and Senator Daniel Evans Republican of Washington As for Planned Parenthoods lawsuit in April the Government requested that the court dismiss it and a decision on that motion is expected in September Mr Morris argues that Ms Wattleton and others at Planned Parenthood should decide whether to be advocates of family planning or advocates of abortion If they choose to advocate abortion he said the agency has other voluntary organizations here and abroad that are willing and able to take Planned Parenthoods place Were as committed as ever to family planning he said As long as that does not include the taking of human lives which is what abortion is Ms Wattleton counters that the organizations that AID would turn to have neither Planned Parenthoods experience nor expertise and in many cases are interested for religious or ideological reasons in promoting only relatively ineffective birth control methods As for taking lives she said at least 200000 women in the third world die from illegal abortions every year That number is bound to rise Ms Wattleton said if United States policy remains unchanged
Refusal to Treat AIDS Addressed,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/29/us/refusal-to-treat-aids-addressed.html,Health experts here have urged hospital administrators to develop guidelines for dealing with doctors who refuse to treat AIDS patients The experts appearing on an AIDS panel Monday at the opening of the American Hospital Associations annual meeting said that most hospitals have yet to develop such policies The panel members told administrators they should not wait until a patient is refused treatment to adopt such rules The chances that an administrator will have to confront a doctor who refuses to treat an AIDS patient are increasing as the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome grows the experts said My impression is that most hospitals do not have such policies now said Linda Brooks the director of infection control for the hospital association One of the problems is that the AMA has a policy which says that doctors should be allowed to choose who they want to treat That was basically developed to deal with abortion and other situations where there were ethical concerns Ms Brooks said Part of the reason for refusing AIDS patients may be financial too Doctor Can Refuse Patient Dr Harrison L Rogers Jr a past president of the American Medical Association said that a doctor does have the right to refuse to treat a patient But he said that any doctor who does so has a responsibility to find someone who will provide treatment At some hospitals doctors have been dismissed for refusing to treat AIDS patients administrators said Margaret D Domanski director of social work at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit told a panel on treatment of AIDS patients that a resident physician at Henry Ford Hospital had been dismissed for refusing to treat an AIDS patients Other administrators said that some hospitals would require staff physicians who refuse AIDS patients to explain their decisions to ethics boards which may strip the physicians of their hospital practice privileges At least one doctor attending the conference said he no longer performed certain procedures on any patients I will no longer perform mouthtomouth resuscitation said Dr Gregory L Henry an emergency room physician in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Mich I consider that an unfair risk to myself and my family We are coming into a whole new world Dr Henry said of the disease I know of no resident who hasnt stuck himself with a needle or cut himself before his training is over Its part of the learning experience But now there may be a much higher price for that education
LIFE IN THE 30's,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/29/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,I WOULD like to say that I became a feminist to make the world better for women everywhere but in truth it was to make the world better for me This was almost 20 years ago and altruism was not my strong suit to paraphrase Rhett Butler the only cause I believed in was me Nor was I struck by the rank injustice of sex discrimination It just seemed as if men got all the good stuff I grew up in a city run by men in a church run by men in a household run by a man Men had comfortable shoes a life outside the home money in their wallets Women had children who are wonderful but not sufficient unto themselves at least for me The best job you could get as a woman then involved a lifetime vow of chastity which was not my thing I figured either life was going to be considerably different for me than it was for my mother or I was going to be angry all the time I jumped on the bandwagon Ive never gotten off As I watched the convention of the National Organization for Women on television the other night I realized that my only real political identification has been with womens rights I also realized that despite my earlier emphasis on selfinterest it is the only cause I have ever believed in that has improved the world Life for many women is not the same as it was when I was young and I do not believe it will ever be so again I do not believe that ever again will there be a handful of token women in the graduating class at Harvard Law School I do not believe that ever again will there be a handful of female police officers in New York City Change is exceedingly slow but somehow sure My friend the female rabbi still meets up with the occasional father of the bride who will not pay for the wedding if she officiates To write that sentence alone is a measure of the shock of the new and the stubborn strength of the old On the one hand the father of the bride and his wallet On the other a rabbi who is a woman I went to a womens college Not long ago I was asked what it was like At the time I was speaking to students at a college that until 1969 had been allmale and fiercely proud to be so I said it was a little like learning to swim while holding on to the side of the pool I didnt learn the arm movements until after I graduated but by that time I was one terrific kicker When I began university the marks made by student demonstrators were still emblazoned on the buildings Perhaps that was why some of us were happy to view our own feminism as a liberal and not a radical political movement A liberal movement is precisely what we got We were permitted limited access to the world of men provided that to some considerable extent we mimicked their behavior but did not totally alter our own I suppose we sometimes feel disappointed with our circumstances today because now that the liberal movement has taken place now that women are performing thoracic surgery and becoming members of the welders union it becomes clearer than ever that what we really needed was a radical movement The word has an ominous connotation but it means only a root change We needed a root change in the way things work in the way everyone approached work in the way everyone approached the care of children in the way everyone men and women approached the balance of life and work and obligations and inclinations I do not think this really came about Everyone now accepts that men too can cry but women still often have more reason to We must fight for parental leaves for mothers and fathers one feminist told me and I knew she was right except that I didnt know many men who were going to take paternity leaves if they were offered I suppose we must fight to raise sons who will take them We still find ourselves dependent on the kindness of strangers from Supreme Court Justices to husbands and lovers I do not believe that we are likely to go back to a time when patients refused to be treated by female doctors but I think that we could go back to a time when doctors of either sex were forbidden by law to perform abortions I think that institutions run by men with a sprinkling of women in high places may begin to feel selfcongratulatory and less enthusiastic about hiring and promotion efforts about which they have always been ambivalent It is difficult to communicate some of the terror of this to young women who have grown up with a sense of entitlement who were born in the year in which in Atlantic City a huge garbage bin was filled with undergarments to protest the Miss America pageant who grew up knowing that they could go to Princeton or rabbinical school or the moon if they worked hard enough who have never been asked how fast they typed Some have told me that they do not think of themselves as feminists that they are a generation of individualists who do not align themselves with a group cause particularly one that represents battles they believe have largely been won Perhaps it was a particularly female thing about me but I did not feel qualified when I was young to be an individualist I felt that by birth I was part of a group and that the signal hallmark of that group was that they were denied access to money and power by virtue of biology That seemed overwhelming to me at 17 and it seemed to present me with two choices One was to distinguish myself from other women the other was to stand up for the rights of women as a group I wasnt up to going it alone Luckily I didnt have to I had my sisters

"REAGAN, OPENING BORK FIGHT, CALLS JUDGE A MODERATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/us/reagan-opening-bork-fight-calls-judge-a-moderate.html,President Reagan opened his campaign today to win Senate confirmation of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court and he stressed themes that differ sharply from the views of the Presidents hardline conservative supporters Speaking to a group of lawenforcement officials at the Executive Office Building the President portrayed Judge Bork as a moderate and reasonable jurist who shared the detachment and statesmanship that marked the career of the man he would replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr He also contended that Judge Bork was in the tradition of such former Justices as Louis D Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter two heroes to many Democrats To bolster his argument the President maintained that in 10 cases where the Supreme Court had reviewed opinions written by Judge Bork Justice Powell had agreed with him nine times Judge Bork now serves on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Hinges on Moderates The Presidents statement marked the beginning of a concerted attempt by the White House to diminish Judge Borks public image as a rightwing kook in the words of one Administration strategist Without that shift the strategist added the judge stands little chance of winning confirmation by a Senate that is controlled 54 to 46 by the Democrats This nomination hinges on the moderates in the Senate the middleoftheroaders the strategist said The leftwingers have already made up their minds and the rightwingers have already made up their minds Now the realists those of us who hustle for votes have got to get down to brass tacks The attempt at depicting Judge Bork as moderate has angered some of the Administrations hardline conservative allies who see Judge Bork as a man who will decisively tip the balance of the Court toward the right On a number of issues including abortion and civil rights Justice Powell has provided the swing vote in tilting the Court toward a more liberal view Screaming Fight Over Bork The emotions generated by the struggle over the Bork nomination were demonstrated this week when an aide to a conservative Republican Senator engaged in a screaming fight according to one eyewitness with an Administration lobbyist in the halls of the Capitol The aide was complaining that the Administration was not doing enough to promote Judge Borks cause the witness said Liberals have seized on the conservatives enthusiasm for the Bork nomination as a sign that the judge is more extreme than the White House would have the public believe This week the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights a coalition of organizations that strongly opposes Judge Bork distributed a compilation of the major arguments against the nominee It included extensive quotations from the Judges writings that in the conferences view rebut the argument that he is a moderate in the Powell mold The primary reason for opposing nominee Bork the conference said is that he has aligned himself against most of the landmark decisions protecting civil rights and individual liberties that the Supreme Court has rendered over the past four decades Filibuster Called Probable Administration officials say that they will probably face a filibuster against Judge Bork and thus will need 60 votes to cut off debate and push the nomination through They point out that 65 senators voted last year to confirm William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice but that after defeat retirement and death only 55 of those legislators remain in the current Senate If all 46 Republicans voted to break a filibuster a highly unlikely prospect the Administration would need 14 Democratic votes to win White House votecounters have identified about 18 or 20 potential recruits mainly Southerners like John B Breaux of Louisiana and Richard C Shelby of Alabama The White House was encouraged by a statement Tuesday by Senator Robert C Byrd the Democratic leader who said the Bork nomination should not become a lightning rod and a party litmus test Marlin Fitzwater the Presidents spokesman said the remarks are welcome because they signal some movement away from a highly politicized debate over the nomination Mr Reagan speaking today at the White House to the National Law Enforcement Council asserted Its hard for a fairminded person to escape the conclusion that if you want someone with Justice Powells detachment and statesmanship you cant do better than Judge Bork Court of Felix Frankfurters The President argued that like Justice Powell Judge Bork was an advocate of judicial restraint the idea that judges should not impose their own views on the political world A leading exponent of that philosophy was Justice Frankfurter who was appointed to the Court by Franklin D Roosevelt and Mr Reagan made an appeal to bipartisan impulses when he said If I could appoint a whole Supreme Court of Felix Frankfurters I would Mr Reagan also quoted approvingly from a recent article on the OpEd page of The New York Times by Lloyd Cutler President Carters counsel who endorsed Judge Borks devotion to judicial restraint The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights disagreed sharply with that analysis saying Bork is an advocate for judicial restraint in dealing with legislation he favors mainly that restricting individual rights or liberties but not in dealing with laws he opposes mainly those impinging on property interests

U.S. PROSOSES CURB ON CLINICS GIVING ABORTION ADVICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/us/us-prososes-curb-on-clinics-giving-abortion-advice.html,President Reagan proposed a new set of regulations today that would bar family planning clinics that get Federal funds from counseling clients about abortion Mr Reagan who has repeatedly failed to win Congressional approval of measures to ban abortions drew prolonged cheers when he announced the regulations at a meeting of antiabortion advocates at the White House Marlin Fitzwater the Presidents spokesman explained that the rules were designed to insure the integrity of Federal money and to make it clear that the Administration does not support abortion counseling Denounced as Illegal About 4000 clinics serving 43 million clients receive family planning funds that total 1425 million for the current fiscal year according to the Department of Health and Human Services which would administer the new rules About 85 percent of the clients are lowincome women and about onethird are adolescents Supporters of a womans right to choose an abortion denounced the regulations immediately as illegal and at odds with the intent of Congress Several groups promised to fight the President in court and critics in Congress said they would introduce legislation to reverse the regulations Mr Reagan said the rules would be published in the Federal Register probably within 30 days Under Federal procedures they would then be open for public comment probably for 60 days before becoming final Some representatives of clinics said today that if forced to choose they would refuse Federal money rather than accept limitations on the advice they offer their clients Other experts said that as a practical matter many state and local clinics would have no choice but to follow whatever regulations are adopted Douglas Gould a spokesman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America called the rules a sop to the right wing and added They are trying to defund Planned Parenthood period They know we cannot abide by this kind of restriction because we cannot do it ethically There playing word games They say they dont want to put us out of business but then they impose restrictions they know we cant abide by Planned Parenthood operates 769 clinics in the United States and receives about 30 million in Federal funds each year Mr Fitzwater said the Administrations intent was not to close family planning clinics but rather to force them to change the way they do business Other critics said the rules would violate medical ethics because they would deprive a physician of the right to advise a patient about all possible medical options Stimulating Support for GOP President Reagan has made opposition to abortion a keystone of his social agenda but antiabortion groups have been increasingly dismayed at the Administrations failure to make significant changes in the law A senior Administration official said the announcement today was designed partly to assuage those groups and to stimulate their support for the Republican ticket next year These are groups that certainly give you a lot of intensity said the official Its fair to say that if they embraced the Republican nominee in 1988 that would be a tremendous benefit I think its a good thing to do politically The decision also reflects a mood of growing urgency in the White House as officials realize that the Presidents power is dwindling along with the time left in his term I dont think the Presidency comes to a stop in the last 18 months the official said There are still things we want to accomplish and this is one of them The announcement comes only a few weeks after Mr Reagan delighted abortion opponents by nominating Judge Robert H Bork for a vacancy on the Supreme Court Other Rules Announced In addition to the rule on abortion counseling Mr Reagan also announced these moves today  Family planning clinics that receive Federal money would have to be physically separated from clinics that perform abortions Mr Fitzwater said it was unclear whether that would mean different buildings or simply different rooms  Dr C Everett Koop the Surgeon General was directed to develop a solid body of health information on the effects of abortion Growing numbers of women whove had abortions now say they have been misled by inaccurate information Mr Reagan said  The Administration will elminate an existing regulation that requires clinics receiving Federal money to mention abortion as a possible remedy for pregnancy The rule has prevented clinics run by some religious organizations from receiving Government funds Dispute Over Legality The new regulations have sparked a fierce legal dispute The Administration argues that under current law it has the right to issue regulations restricting the ability of family planning clinics to offer abortion counseling They cite the legislative history of the family planning law which says the program cannot be used to encourage or promote abortion as a method of birth control Critics of this view reply however that the regulations not only violate medical ethics but a physicians right to free speech Representative Bill Green a Manhattan Republican issued a statement saying The Administration may wish to circumvent Congress by doing through regulation what it cannot get through legislation But it will have a harder time getting around the Bill of Rights Mr Gould said These regulations are clearly illegal from a constitutional standpoint We believe they fly right in the face of Congressional intent Congress said very specifically it did not want changes made in the administration of this program This is not a dictatorship he added There is still a Congress and a court system and we will follow it through the courts if we need to
LIMITS ON ABORTION COUNSELING OPPOSED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/us/limits-on-abortion-counseling-opposed.html,Family planning professionals said today that the abortion regulations proposed by President Reagan could severely limit the services provided by the more than 4000 clinics in the United States that receive Federal funds Pregnancy is a leading reason people call a clinic and virtually all teenagers who come to a clinic are there because of a pregnancy scare said Doug Gould a vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the countrys largest family planning agency He and other family planning experts said they would fight the Presidents proposed restrictions on abortion counseling by clinics that receive Federal funds They said that if the regulations were imposed they would refuse Government money rather than limit the advice they could give The loss of the money however would mean curtailing services family planning experts said Less money means we provide less information which can only lead to more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions said Bill Baird the director of nonprofit birth control centers in Boston and in Hempstead and Hauppauge LI Some Would Have No Choice Many state county and other local clinics would have no choice but to abide by whatever regulations are promulgated other experts said According to Government figures 43 million people receive family planning information annually at more than 4000 clinics Mr Gould said that state county and other local clinics serve 40 percent of the nations family planning clients Planned Parenthoods 769 clinics serve 27 percent hospitals serve 13 percent with the balance served by neighborhood health centers or health maintenance plans Its the poor and the teenagers who would suffer most because of these regulations because theyre the ones who dont have private doctors they can go to go to said Mr Baird At whatever type of clinic Mr Gould said the normal practice is a woman comes in and says she thinks shes pregnant Shes then tested to make sure If its determined that she is pregnant we ask her how she feels about it If she says great we say congratulations and tell her about three places she can go to for prenatal care However Mr Gould said if the client is unhappy about being pregnant or unsure how she feels We say Here are your options  The options he went on are a fullterm pregnancy after which the woman keeps the baby or surrenders it for adoption or an end to the pregnancy and if thats her decision we tell her about three places she can go to have the abortion Mr Gould said counselors for reputable agencies outline rather than advocate choices Under the Presidents proposed regulations however a family planning counselor would be prohibited from discussing abortion with a client even if specifically asked

Bork Is No Centrist Disguised as a Conservative,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/opinion/l-bork-is-no-centrist-disguised-as-a-conservative-863287.html,To the Editor Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr was selected for the Supreme Court by Richard M Nixon and his decisions largely accorded with the political agenda of that President On a wide range of issues  welfare rights criminal procedure school desegregation and the protection of individual speech against corporate power  Justice Powell took a position that almost all commentators would characterize as conservative Justice Powells reputation as a centrist stems almost exclusively from his role in two of the liberal victories of the Burger Court era University of California v Bakke allowing affirmative programs for racial minorities and Roe v Wade invalidating the abortion laws of the states In both he sided with the majority Judge Robert H Bork has denounced both of these decisions emphatically and persistently He owes his preeminence as a conservative spokesman  and perhaps his nomination  in no small measure to his rejection of the constitutional doctrine associated with these cases I therefore read with some amazement Lloyd Cutlers Saving Bork From Both Friends and Enemies OpEd July 16 He portrays Judge Bork as a centrist who is likely to emerge on the Court with a position not far from the Justice whose chair he has been nominated to fill Mr Cutler tries to minimize the differences between Judge Bork and Justice Powell on the Bakke case by saying that Judge Borks criticism was limited to the constitutional theory of the opinion As the constitutional issue lay at the heart of the case this is not much of a limitation Mr Cutler then notes that Judge Bork expressly conceded that affirmative action might well be a desirable social policy The only source of that artfully drafted comment appears to be an introductory phrase the judge uttered as part of a sentence that has a decidedly different emphasis The merits of the social policy aside the Courts constitutional warrant for authorizing it was not displayed in the Bakke case On Roe v Wade Judge Borks views are clear and diametrically opposed to Justice Powells In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981 Judge Bork characterized the abortion ruling as an unconstitutional decision and as a serious and wholly unjustifiable usurpation of state legislative authority Mr Cutler maintains that this does not mean that he is a sure vote to overrule Roe v Wade Surely this is true in the weakest sense of truth But if we judge Robert Bork on probable votes  very probable votes  there is every reason to see his appointment as a threat to Roe v Wade As if to reassure the liberal coalition on the abortion issue Mr Cutler insists that Judge Borks writings reflect a respect for precedent Nothing could be farther from the truth what Judge Borks writings spanning almost 20 years as a professor  reflect is not a concern for precedent but a dogmatic commitment to a comprehensive or general theory and a willingness to denounce repudiate even deride decisions that do not agree with his theory Judge Borks performance on the Court of Appeals has not revealed a change of outlook Indeed his recent effort to confine the righttoprivacy decisions of the Supreme Court earned him a rebuke by his colleagues who insisted that it is not their function to conduct a general spring cleaning of constitutional law Elevating Judge Bork to the Supreme Court is not likely to instill within him a new reverence for authority but rather give him the power to write his views into law OWEN M FISS Alexander M Bickel Professor of Public Law Yale University New Haven July 20 1987
"Justice Stevens, in Unusual Move, Praises Bork as Nominee to Court",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/01/us/justice-stevens-in-unusual-move-praises-bork-as-nominee-to-court.html,Justice John Paul Stevens has entered the fray in support of Judge Robert H Bork the nominee to the Supreme Court in unusual public remarks praising his qualifications and implicitly rejecting the portrait of a rigid rightwing ideologue painted by some opponents of the nomination In a littlenoted public speech in Colorado two weeks ago Justice Stevens likened Judge Borks constitutional philosophy as expressed in one 1984 opinion to that of himself and two other moderate centrists on the Court Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who retired June 26 and Justice Potter Stewart who retired in 1981 and has since died I personally regard him as a very wellqualified candidate and one who will be a very welcome addition to the Court Justice Stevens said of Judge Bork There are many many reasons that lead me to that conclusion Possible Effect of Remarks Justice Stevenss remarks could be helpful to Bork supporters both because it is unusual for Supreme Court Justices to speak out publicly on nominations and because of Judge Stevenss reputation as a centrist who has voted with the Courts liberals on such issues as abortion affirmative action and separation of church and state While he did not directly challenge the widespread view that Judge Bork would shift the Courts ideological balance sharply to the right Justice Stevenss remarks strongly suggested that Judge Bork was in the legal mainstream at least on some issues Justice Stevens made his statements publicly in a speech to the Eighth Circuit Judicial Conference a meeting of Federal judges from several states in Colorado Springs on July 17 A transcript based on a tape recording was provided to The New York Times today by a Bork supporter who insisted on anonymity The Stevens remarks had previously been reported by The Omaha WorldHerald and The Minneapolis Star and Tribune but did not receive national attention Justice Stevenss secretary responding to a message a reporter left for him Thursday at his hotel in Aspen Colo said today that the Justice would not speak to a reporter or elaborate but confirmed that Justice Stevens made the remarks July 17 After delivering his prepared text for that speech Justice Stevens added his assessment of Judge Bork and said one of the reasons he welcomed the nomination was a concurring opinion by Judge Bork in a libel cas e in 1984 from which Justice Stevens proceeded to read aloud at some length The Bork opinion arguing that judges should provide greater protection for the press against certain libel suits even though the framers of the First Amendment apparently did not intend to curb libel suits at all cited the judicial tradition of a continuing evolution of doctrine to serve the central purpose of the First Amendment This view of constitutional interpretation Justice Stevens told the group is consistent with the philosophy that you will find in opinions written by Justice Stewart and Justice Powell and some of the things that I have written Private Expression of Support Justice Stevens noted in his speech that he had already expressed his favorable opinion of Judge Bork to an American Bar Association representative preparing a report on the nomination and added I see no reason why I shouldnt express it publicly Several legal analysts said today that they could not recall a previous occasion on which a Justice had publicly endorsed a nomination to the High Court But the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary in its favorable report last summer on Associate Justice William H Rehnquists nomination to be Chief Justice said that it had interviewed most or all other members of the Court and that they had uniformly praised his temperament professionalism and integrity Many critics of Judge Bork as well as many more neutral analysts have said that his published views place him well to the right of Justice Powell and others including Justices Stevens and Stewart and that his confirmation would tip the closely divided Courts ideological balance well to the right For example Justices Powell and Stewart joined in the Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion and Justice Stevens who was appointed later has supported that ruling Judge Bork has strongly assailed the abortion ruling as unconstitutional and it seems highly probable that he would provide the fifth vote on the Court to narrow or overrule it Justice Stevens did not mention Judge Borks views on abortion or other positions except for the 1984 libel opinion in his speech Praise for Other Justices Justice Stevens also had praise for Justice Powell and for the Courts two most conservative members Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia a friend of Judge Bork whom President Reagan appointed to the Court last summer Justice Stevens called Justice Scalia a very delightful and excellent powerful addition to the Court who has an excellent sense of humor and an open mind He said Justice Scalia had sometimes been persuaded by colleagues to change his initial view of a case and vice versa He said Chief Justice Rehnquist who has long been wellliked even by members of the Court like Justice Stevens who have major philosophical disagreements with him has been a fine Chief Justice He said Justice Powells surprise retirement had been a very emotional experience because he is a person of whom all of us were particularly fond and have particular respect I have always considered him a particularly wise man he said of Justice Powell citing his sound sense of how to handle cases that dont always fit into logical boxes and neat doctrine and all the rest Justice Stevens also said Justice Powell had a special special quality of patriotism that is very hard to describe Justice Stevenss remarks on Judge Borks libel opinion seemed implicitly to challenge critics who have characterized as rigid and anachronistic Judge Borks view that the original intent of the framers of the Constitution is the only legitimate basis for constitutional interpretation
The President's Pro-Abortion Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/01/opinion/the-president-s-pro-abortion-policy.html,Each year more than four million women most of them poor and a third of them teenagers rely on the nations 4500 federally supported family planning clinics There they find advice about contraception pregnancy tests and abortion counseling Such clinics also spare the Government considerable money that otherwise would go to pay the health and welfare costs of unintended births Now the Reagan Administration would ban Federal funds to clinics that offer abortion counselling This harassment is defended as a way to reduce abortions In fact it is likely to increase them along with health costs Opponents will challenge the ban in court They have a strong case President Reagan vows to push just as hard as I know how for prolife measures To that end he warms over an old proposal that Representative Jack Kemp and Senator Orrin Hatch tried and failed to get through Congress two years ago Now the Administration would impose the funding ban by writing it into Federal regulations governing Title X of the Public Health Act Should the rules take effect after a period of public comment family planning counselors would jeopardize Federal grants should they so much as mention abortion as an option for a client Promoters of the idea claim a need to erect a wall of separation between family planning and abortion But that wall virtually exists already No federally funded clinics provide or recommend abortions Instead they do what all licensed healthcare providers should do inform the pregnant woman that abortion is a legal option and give her a referral if she requests one The threat of no funding puts health professionals in an impossible ethical bind To ignore the ban would mean giving up Federal money and cutting back services To comply with the ban would mean denying women access to information necessary to an informed choice about family planning Compliance would create the greatest hardship for the poorest women since abortion advice remains readily available to those who can afford private consultations And by making it harder for the clinics to do their basic birthcontrol job Mr Reagans antiabortion initiative may actually raise the abortion rate In accepting a Federal grant a health professional should not have to give up the right to free speech in offering medical advice Therein lies the basis for a legal challenge Opponents of the measure may also argue that Congress never intended such a limit on Federal spending for family planning The proposed regulations counterproductive even on their own terms deserve an early death in court
U.S. Continues in Family Planning,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/01/opinion/l-us-continues-in-family-planning-462187.html,To the Editor Because the world has just marked the birth of its five billionth inhabitant stories relating to population issues have been in the news We would like to speak of the United States Agency for International Developments familyplanning programs and set the record straight regarding some inaccurate and misleading perceptions about them The Reagan Administration along with 139 other countries agreed at an international conference in Mexico City in 1984 that abortion is not an appropriate means of family planning The policy of this Administration is to provide strong support for voluntary family planning and firm opposition to abortion as a viable method Planned Parenthood for example is challenging this policy in Federal courts However in a major advertising campaign Planned Parenthood also charges that extremists have targeted the familyplanning program for destruction Nothing could be farther from the truth This Administration is spending 237 million on family planning programs in 80 countries up from 190 million in 1981 That constitutes 40 percent of all funds being devoted this year to family planning throughout the world making the United States the largest single donor in this area Since the Reagan Administration took office in 1981 it has spent more than 16 billion on population and familyplanning programs thats equal to the entire amount spent by the four preceding Administrations since the programs began in 1965 To say that we are cutting back on family planning is completely out of context and therefore both misleading and unfair Our population program responds to nations that are concerned that their rates of population growth be in line with their rates of economic growth and productivity In addition the Reagan Administration believes that couples should be able to choose the number of children they wish to have and to control spacing of those children Experience has demonstrated that adequate spacing of births helps improve health and survival of both children and mother Far from denying United States funds to organizations that promote family planning and birth control we strongly support the availability of the widest range of family planning options consistent with the culture and mores of both this nation and the host government Our programs assist developing nations to set up clinics and community outreach programs and to train physicians paramedics and field workers We provide safe and effective contraceptive supplies and we support research on better contraceptive technology as well as programs that offer a full range of methods of family planning including pills condoms intrauterine devices voluntary sterilization and natural family planning THOMAS R BLANK Assistant Administrator Bureau of External Affairs Agency for Internatl Development Washington July 20 1987

ABORTION COUNSELING; Reagan Plan to Restrict Clinic's Funds May Be Vulnerable to Legal Challenge,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/01/us/abortion-counseling-reagan-plan-restrict-clinic-s-funds-may-be-vulnerable-legal.html,President Reagans plan to place drastic restrictions on the ability of 4500 family planning clinics to give their patients information about abortion appears vulnerable to legal challenge for violating both the intent of Congress and the Constitution On the one hand Mr Reagans proposal regarding clinics that get Federal money might be circumventing the will of Congress by using regulations to achieve a purpose that Congress had refused to embrace through legislation On the other is the First Amendment issue of restricting the free spread of information Whatever the eventual judgment of the courts the new regulations will have the immediate effect of reassuring one of his key constituencies  the antiabortion advocates who had grown restless with his failure to change the abortion status quo  that he still has their agenda at heart This group was particularly angered this month when Dr Otis R Bowen the Secretary of Health and Human Services dismissed a deputy assistant secretary who was a strong abortion opponent for refusing to renew training grants to which two Planned Parenthood affiliates were entitled by law The official Jo Ann Gasper became a symbol for many in the antiabortion movement of what they saw as the Administrations lack of attention to their cause She was hired this week by the Department of Education and President Reagan took care Thursday to point out that Secretary Bowen is fully supportive of my position on abortion Informed Consent Policy Mr Reagan announced Thursday that the Administration would draft regulations to bar the use of Federal funds now 1425 million a year for counseling women about abortion or for advocating promoting or encouraging abortion The federally supported clinics serve 43 million women a year many of them lowincome teenagers The issue of Congressional intent revolves around a 17yearold law Title X of the Public Health Service Act that prohibited clinics from using Federal money to perform abortions But the regulations that put the law into force contain an informed consent policy that not only permits but requires clinics to discuss abortion as an option and to provide referrals to privately funded abortion facilities if requested Although the President addressing a cheering crowd of antiabortion activists made it clear that those regulations would be withdrawn it is not exactly clear what the White House plans to substitute The new regulations to be published in 30 days are not yet drafted and their full scope has not yet been decided Chris Cox a White House lawyer said in an interview that the thrust of the new rules would be to insure that clinics did not use Federal money to counsel women on their options If you give option counseling he said then it means you talk about abortion We Dont Know the Answer Mr Cox was asked what the clinics response should be if the patient rather than the counselor raised the question of abortion in seeking information about how to deal with an unwanted pregnancy Thats a good question and we dont know the answer yet he replied Whatever the Administration eventually accomplishes legal challenges are inevitable And coming virtually on the eve of the Senates consideration of Judge Robert H Bork for the Supreme Court they will focus attention on the Courts crucial role in defining permissible Government action in this area In the last 22 years the Supreme Court has issued 30 decisions on contraception and abortion Judge Bork has described some of the key rulings including the landmark Roe v Wade case that legalized a womans right to an abortion as wrongly decided The Court has not ruled directly on the question presented by the proposed regulations whether the Government can restrict discussion of abortion as a condition for accepting Federal money But several years ago a Federal appeals court struck down an Illinois law that provided state funds for pregnancy counseling on the condition that the recipients not discuss abortion Concerns About Manipulation Janet Benshoof a lawyer in charge of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union said a Federal regulation that precludes discussion as you and I know it in a federally funded facility would violate the First Amendments guarantee of free speech She said the clinics patients typically young poor and lacking access to other medical care constituted a captive audience that under the proposed regulation would be given misinformation There is a reliance factor she said They think theyre getting all the options but theyre not She added It undermines the whole purpose of the First Amendment for the Government to use the power of the purse to manipulate and distort information as important to personal liberty as the abortion decision In areas other than abortion the Supreme Court has set limits on the extent to which the Government can restrict speech as a condition of receiving Federal funds In 1984 it struck down a section of the Public Broadcasting Act that barred radio and television stations that received Federal money from broadcasting editorials The Court said the law restricted speech that lies at the heart of First Amendment protection Developing Area of Law The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions is a rapidly developing area of law that generally maintains that the Government cannot use the expenditure of money to coerce behavior that it could not constitutionally require through direct regulation But this notion is more complex in practice than in theory The boundary lines are hazy Prof Albert J Rosenthal of Columbia Law School wrote in a recent article in the Stanford Law Review In the article Professor Rosenthal argued that courts should examine governmental conditions most rigorously when individual liberties were at stake The Federal family planning law Title X has been under political attack from antiabortion forces for years Originally passed as an antiabortion measure it did not go far enough for the antiabortion groups who particularly objected to the way the Department of Health and Human Services administered it But efforts to amend the law failed In 1985 an amendment to bar abortion counseling that was sponsored by Representative Jack F Kemp the New York Republican was killed in the House Appropriations Committee Opponents argued both that the proposal was unconstitutional and that it would leave family planning facilities open to malpractice suits in cases where proper medical care for a pregnant woman would have included discussions about abortion For example current regulations of the Food and Drug Administration require women who receive intrauterine contraceptive devices to be told that an abortion may be medically necessary if they become pregnant Women who become pregnant with an IUD in place face a risk of death 50 times greater than the average woman Mr Cox the White House assistant counsel predicted that in the event of a court challenge well win hands down Its a nonsequitur to say that the Federal Government has to pay for all constitutionally permitted public activity he said
G.O.P. PONDERS AN APPEAL TO MINORITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/weekinreview/gop-ponders-an-appeal-to-minorities.html,WHEN Bob Dole the Senate Republican leader stared down at an audience of young Republicans the other day he was struck not so much by what he saw as what he did not Id like to see 50 wheelchairs in this audience he said Id like to see 50 black faces 50 Hispanics 50 AsianAmericans The problem with the Republicans he said is that were sort of a hardhearted party the upper crust Representative Jack Kemp who is also running for the Republican Presidential nomination has made the opening up of the party to members of minority groups something of a private crusade Vice President Bush has signed on blacks both in the Vice Presidential office and in his Presidential campaign What all three candidates may be up against is the limits of conversion Over the last two decades the Republican Party has broken Democratic hegemony in one component of the New Deal coalition after another But the gains were among whites Blacks remained a virtual bloc vote for the Democrats Endangering Gains As recently as 1960 Richard M Nixon won about a third of the black vote against John F Kennedy And in the 1970s William E Brock 3d the Secretary of Labor who was then Republican National Committee Chairman invested a great deal of energy and some money in winning back black voters who left after Senator Barry Goldwaters 1964 Presidential campaign What happened According to Willie Leftwich a black lawyer in Washington who has been active in Republican politics for two decades the party was just not serious In any event he adds it was fearful that too overt an appeal to blacks would endanger gains among whites particularly conservative Democrats The theory has always been that for every black vote I get Ill lose two white votes out in the West he said Eddie Williams president of the Joint Center in Washington agreed Its the Flip Wilson syndrome They want to woo black votes but they want to do it in the booth in the corner in the back in the dark This year however some Republicans hope for an increase in the partys share of the black vote though few expect a return to the 1960 levels As a survey of black Americans last summer by Gallup for the Joint Center for Political Studies found younger blacks  those who had not gone through the civil rights struggles  are much less loyal to the Democrats than older blacks While huge majorities in all black groups called themselves Democrats the survey showed only 37 percent of blacks under 30 described their allegiance to the party as strong compared with over 50 percent among older blacks This generation gap combined with the growth of the black professional and middle class has given Republicans cause for optimism So have the partys successes among Hispanics Although mainland Puerto Ricans remain largely impervious to Republican appeals their votes have been balanced by middleclass and socially conservative MexicanAmericans and by CubanAmericans whose fierce antiCastro feelings and conservative social values put them squarely in the Reagan coalition Thaddeus Garrett Jr a black Republican who is a senior adviser to Vice President Bushs campaign is among those who point to ideological grounds for black voters to consider the Republicans According to public opinion polls blacks are more conservative than Democratic leaders on many domestic issues notably crime drugs and abortion Mr Garrett and other Republicans including some blacks also point to the successes of some Republican senators and Republican governors among black voters and as a sign of the partys openness to the nomination of William Lucas a black county executive for governor of Michigan last year But Mr Lucass candidacy also provided a sign of the partys problems He lost the black vote to the Democratic incumbent Governor James J Blanchard Diverse Appeals Michele Davis executive director of the Republican Governors Association noted that Republican governors have won black votes both because of the kinds of people they are and the kinds of issues they emphasize In governors races you dont have polarization because you dont usually have ideologues running And in governors races youre talking about things like education and safe roads things that appeal to a lot more diverse voter groups Those are exactly the sorts of things Republican governors were talking about at last weeks meeting of the National Governors Association in Traverse City Governor Kean of New Jersey who won a majority of the black vote in his 1985 reelection campaign agreed that there is a message in the victories of governors like himself But he said Republican efforts among blacks have been wholly inadequate In 1984 he said Republicans reached out to the Hispanic community to almost every ethnic community in America except the black community Youre talking about losing a major vote by 9to1 Mr Kean said Is there any other group in America that a party is willing to lose by that much Just 25 or 30 percent of the black vote he maintained would give the Republicans a chance at the House of Representatives which it has not won since 1952 The Republican party could win black votes he said by showing a clear commitment to civil rights and an end to apartheid in South Africa and also by going to places Republicans dont usually go to He campaigned in a bar in a black neighborhood he said where the bartender looked at him and said The last time we saw this many whites in here it was a raid THE NEW YORK TIMESCBS NEWS POLL Chipping away at the New Deal coalition Republicans Ten years ago and today Percentage of various groups identifying themselves as Republicans July July 1977 1987

VOICES FROM THE BARBIE TRIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/magazine/voices-from-the-barbie-trial.html,IT WAS LESS A CRIMINAL TRIAL in the usual sense than a morality play in which Everyman meets the Devil and survives For once the Devil did not have the best lines During the trials eight weeks which ended July 4 in the French city of Lyons there were no usual objections to be sustained or overruled no usual crossexaminations no character witnesses to swear that the accused was a good father and model husband Instead there was the collective voice of the witnesses relating after 40 years and more what they could not have forgotten if they had tried What was done to them So that Klaus Barbie became a minor character at his own trial He chose not to attend  his right under French law  except at the beginning and when he was brought in against his will But as the trial went on it became apparent that his presence was irrelevant He was interesting only for what he was a provincial advance man for the Final Solution who now perfectly fitted the postwar mythology of the Nazi war criminal  wanted for murder protected by his United States Army employers discovered alive and well in South America where he sang SS songs and drank toasts to the good old days His victims however were major characters They were victorious simply because they were there There was a particular quality in the eyes of the witnesses It was a quality of youthfulness as if in the camps they had taken on the identities of those who had not returned The children from the village of Izieu in the photograph at right never returned Klaus Barbie ordered that they be seized at the house shown in the pictures on page 26 The witnesses had been through an ordeal that could not be imagined and now they were facetoface with the man who had sent them there and he was old and defeated and they could tell their stories while he could not tell his because his was shameful and theirs was heroic Along with Nuremberg which took place only a year after the Allied victory and the Adolph Eichmann case of 26 years ago this was one of the three great warcrime trials in the West It differed from the others because Klaus Barbie had done more than sign papers and give orders He had personally tortured victims He had liked his work deriving satisfaction from the brutal extraction of information But even so Barbies character was not the most significant difference What was most amazing was that after 40 years the details of what happened could still be told with such vigor by people who had been there and back As one witness Pierre Durand put it We are the few survivors left The voices of those who were in the camps are getting fainter Twenty years from now when we are gone what we said here will matter SOME OF THE WITNESSES HAD NEVER SAID A word about it before not to their friends not to their children because they were afraid they would not be believed Marcel Stourdze who was easy to spot because of his white beard and his oddlooking leather back brace which stuck up from his collar like a huge spoon said The human mouth cannot express what we went through When I was arrested in August 1943 he said I was rather snobbish and I wore a monocle And Barbie in his pride wanted to cut me down to size and gave me an allerretour [ backandforth slap ]  It was the first time in my life that I had ever been slapped But my monocle did not fall out And I considered that a small victory This prominent son of Lyons who went to the best tailor and the best restaurants was deported as a Jew to Auschwitz with his wife and his head and his pubic hair were shaved in public with a dull blade and We had a bowl of warm water for four that we were lapping like dogs and he worked on the cement Kommando work detail and we had no toilet paper so we used the cement bags In April 1944 he was struck with a shovel handle which gave him his back problem When Auschwitz was evacuated in 1945 with the Allies closing in the inmates started on a forced march to another camp and were close to starvation As they went through a village a German woman came out with a kettle full of boiled potatoes which she placed on her doorstep Stourdze was able to grab a couple which gave him the strength to keep walking And it was because of that one charitable gesture that he had been able to forgive the German people for his wife had not returned  her long auburn hair had been used to make pillows for the Luftwaffe SIMONE LAGRANGE ANOTHER WITNESS at the trial was 13 when she was taken to Gestapo headquarters in Lyons with her father and mother and they were questioned by Barbie She was beaten because she would not tell him where her sister and one of her brothers were and she thought All this trouble over two Jewish children Her face was swollen and bleeding and Barbie brought her mother in and said This is what you have done to your daughter Then he changed the girls cell so that the mother thought Simone must have been deported or killed Soon enough she and her parents were deported to Auschwitz Now 57 on the witness stand her hands tightening on the semicircular white rail Simone Lagrange interrupted her testimony and said Excuse me Monsieur le President but my brothers are in the courtroom and what I am about to say will pain them And we knew that the account she then gave of seeing her father shot in front of her had not been told before She had confronted Barbie during the pretrial proceedings  what the French call linstruction  and when he was asked if he recognized her he said When you have been in prison for seven months its always agreeable to see a desirable woman When Simone Lagrange said that his remark insulted her he said The trouble with you is you cant take a joke And Barbie added I dont remember questioning this person I cant remember everybody I dont see why I would have questioned a little girl But Simone Lagrange remembered Vincent Planque is a reflective man a reserved man a retired inspector general for the Ministry of Tourism and he expressed the difficulty he had in testifying These memories were long blocked in my head I never said a word about them He described his years in the Resistance and his capture He was questioned and tortured by Barbie and at one point he said The interrogation took a more vigorous turn The judge insisted he explain what he meant All right then Planque said what struck me the most were the two police dogs When you are on the ground with your hands tied and you have to protect yourself from the fangs of those dogs its rather impressive Genevieve de Gaulle the generals niece now 67 spare and straightbacked her gray hair in a ponytail had been in the Resistance and was sent to Ravensbruck a concentration camp for women in Germany where she saw the children of the guards playing one being guard and the other inmate An Austrian midwife was in charge of drowning prisoners newborn babies in buckets of water She told Genevieve de Gaulle that it took 20 to 30 minutes to drown them such was their lung capacity I was deported for practicing abortions the midwife said and now Im drowning babies And Genevieve de Gaulle so poised so in control of herself on the stand was taken a few hours later to a Lyons hospital with chest pains IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN FRANCE THAT anyone had been charged with crimes against humanity Barbie had been tried in absentia in France twice previously in 1952 and 1954 for specific war crimes and had twice been sentenced to death This time the defendant was in hand but the death sentence had been abolished To avoid double jeopardy the 20year statute of limitations having run out on war crimes Barbie was charged with three new crimes  a raid on a Jewish office in the Rue Ste Catherine the deportation of 44 Jewish children from the village of Izieu and ordering the last train from Lyons to Auschwitz None of these duplicated previous charges and because they were called crimes against humanity they were not subject to a statute of limitations As defined at Nuremberg where the notion was first applied crimes against humanity had to be committed in the name of an ideological enterprise The deportation of Jews for instance was a crime against humanity as long as Barbie knew that he was sending people to their deaths as part of a state policy There were a number of witnesses who testified that Barbie did know One witness whose father had been questioned by Barbie and had been hanged by the thumbs so that his thumbs were as long as his index fingers said that Barbie had told his father You will be Nacht und Nebel  youll see its worse than anything  and you will remember my name Nacht und Nebel means night and fog and it was the name for a Wehrmacht decree under which those deported were never to return Another witness Lucien Margaine said that when he was tortured by Barbie in May 1944 The blood on my back spotted the wallpaper which infuriated him so he hit me with a bicycle lock which broke two of my vertebrae A few days later I was taken to his office again and he said You didnt talk It doesnt matter youll be Nacht und Nebel and youll never see France again  The first crime against humanity Barbie was charged with took place a couple of blocks from the apartment I had taken in the old city of Lyons On Feb 9 1943 the Gestapo on Barbies authority had gone to number 12 Rue Ste Catherine to the headquarters of the UGIF General Union of French Jews to round up Jews Barbie signed three telexes reporting on the operation Now there is a plaque commemorating the event to the left of the entrance of the sixstory building On the second floor in keeping with the ironies of urban life what had once been the UGIF headquarters is a massage parlor I stood there and tried to imagine in the light of the testimony I had heard what had happened on that day The Gestapo men arriving in their softbrimmed hats and long leather overcoats having chosen that day because it was the day when medical care and other social services were offered and there were bound to be a lot of visitors The officer in charge telling the switchboard operator to act natural to tell callers to come on in everything was fine It was what the French call a souriciere mousetrap Those who arrived seeking medical help or ration cards or financial assistance were greeted by Gestapo men who told them they were under arrest It was a terrible scene there all afternoon with more and more people walking into the trap with people praying and weeping and trying to talk their way out Eightyfour Jews were taken that day and deported to concentration camps BARBIE LOOKED HIS AGE WHICH WAS 73 HIS GREY suit did not quite fit him for it had been given to him at the jail His profile was that of a predatory bird but his manner was subdued and if he had a flamboyant or excessive side he did not show it The judge asked him about his background but he was not very forthcoming His parents were teachers and his father fought in World War I and was badly wounded in the neck In an essay he wrote about himself when he finished high school he said that he had belonged to a Catholic association and had done social work with the elderly But in 1933 my only brother died and a few months later I lost my father It was a terrible shock I fell under the influence of National Socialism and now I am a servant of the Fuhrer Barbie was a Nazi from the age of 19 He joined the SS in 1935 when he was 21 and then he joined the SD a closed group within the SS a secretive caste the inner circle of the Hitler regime He took two years of training at the Bernau officers school near Berlin to learn the practical side as he put it At Bernau he learned maxims such as We must have the will to kill coldly and tranquilly And there was an insistence at Bernau on the role of the SD in the solution of the Jewish problem with lectures on race given by Adolph Eichmann and other experts When the war began Barbie was already a fusion of man and ideology saturated by the cult of the leader the exaltation of race superiority the will to exterminate enemies and the German need for Lebensraum living space The ordinary men and women who testified at the trial were as instructive about him as the learned men who gave their expert opinions Vincent Planque for instance said Some say that Barbie was only a subordinate that he only followed orders but I dont think so There was a correlation between Nazism and his personality and he found in this system the possibility of expressing his brutal nature Three psychiatrists who had questioned Barbie in his cell over a twomonth period attempted to throw more light on him To one Barbie was a conformist in the habit of quoting famous names to validate what he was saying Another saw him as humorless and incapable of empathy he could not imagine himself in the place of another person The third saw the key to Barbies character in his birth out of wedlock for he thought of himself as forever a usurper contemptible from birth with no rightful place in society He was a thwarted creature for whom everything depended on legitimacy which he found inside the Nazi party As a second lieutenant in the SS Barbie arrived in midNovember 1942 in Lyons a city known as the capital of the Resistance About two weeks after he arrived two young Communists fired at a German soldier and wounded him A few days later a bomb went off in a restaurant popular with German soldiers In spite of his relatively humble rank Barbie was in charge of police operations in Lyons and a large surrounding area operations that involved the arrest torture and deportation of Resistance people and Jews The reason he had been given this assignment was that he had already shown himself to be a model SS officer commended for his zeal For even within the SS there were hawks and doves as we learned at the trial from two German prosecutors who testified as warcrimes experts There were many different types of behavior inside the SS one of them said The SS major in charge of Battalion 303 in the region of Kiev for instance had in 1941 refused to obey an order to massacre Jews His entire battalion was sent to the front that was its punishment In France the situation changed from city to city In Bordeaux the SS officer in charge was a decent sort of fellow who disapproved of violence and who did not want to commit atrocities against the Jews Of course that wasnt the sort of man needed in Lyons That city with its Resistance activity and its large population of Jews required someone who was not prey to moral qualms or selfdoubt who had an appetite for his work  a man like Klaus Barbie IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THINGS WERE going on beneath the surface of the trial Things unsaid or halfsaid were exerting an influence and you could not really figure out what was happening if you did not know about them On May 15 for instance the original of the trials most important document was brought out to be shown to the jury and the lawyers This was a telex signed by Barbie in which he reported to his superiors in Paris that 44 Jewish children living in the village of Izieu 70 kilometers east of Lyons had been rounded up for deportation The document strips of paper glued to a page of backing was passed around and when it was handed to Jacques Verges Barbies lawyer there came one of the rare outbursts of the trial Serge Klarsfeld a scholarly reserved man one of the 39 Partie Civile lawyers who attended the trial to argue for damages for the victims losing control of his temper jumped up from his seat and told the judges that Verges should not be allowed to handle the telex because he might damage or somehow alter this crucial piece of evidence To grasp why Serge Klarsfeld lost his equinimity you had to know that it was he who had found the telex and turned it over to the court The orginal had been lost for years although Klarsfeld had long ago located the copy used at the Nuremburg trials as well as copies now residing in the National Archives in Washington and in the archives in Bavaria But in 1983 Verges had filed a complaint on Barbies behalf to have these copies declared forgeries Klarsfeld knew that he had to find the original He decided to go though the thousands of file folders stored in boxes in the basement of the Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center in Paris knowing that this might take months In the second box he examined he came across a folder concerning Otto Abetz who had been Hitlers Ambassador to Paris This had nothing to do with Izieu but idly he leafed through the folder And there he saw it  the original of the Izieu telex which someone from the center had no doubt shown to a Juge dInstruction and returned to the wrong folder For Klarsfeld who had spent so much of his adult life tracking documents that were used in Nazi warcrime trials to see finally the original of the Izieu telex was one of the most powerful emotional experiences of his life For he was an archivist a paper chaser and he had gone right to it like a dowser finding water He was sure the Jewish children of Izieu had guided his hand The reason Serge Klarsfeld had become a hunter of Nazis and a searcher of documents to begin with had to do with an incident that took place on the French Riviera in 1943 when he was 8 years old The city of Nice was in the Italian zone of occupation which was why so many Jews had fled there But in September 1943 Gen Dwight D Eisenhower announced the capitulation of the Italians and the Germans moved into Nice and sealed it off trapping 25000 Jews The worst manhunt of the Occupation began with the Gestapo stopping men in the street ordering them to drop their pants and arresting them if they were circumcized Klarsfelds father Arno built a false compartment in the back of a deep closet with enough room for himself his wife and his two chldren On the night of Sept 30 they heard the Germans come into their building and start making the rounds of apartments and they hid But Klarsfelds father decided that when the Germans came into their apartment it would look fishy if no one was there So in his pajamas he left the compartment The Germans asked where his family was and he said they were sick and had gone to the country One of the Gestapo men opened the closet and pushed the clothes back The 8yearold boy behind the false wall could hear the grating of the hangers The Germans told Arno Klarsfeld to get dressed while they waited outside The father must have thought it would look funny if he didnt lock the door behind him He went into the closet tapped and whispered The keys And the compartment opened and his wifes hand emerged holding the keys He took the keys kissed her hand and left Those were the last words Serge Klarsfeld heard his father say Later in the trial when the Partie Civile lawyers were delivering their summations Klarsfeld was the first to speak and Roland Dumas who had been Foreign Minister in the Mitterrand Government was the last This order of speakers was also part of the unspoken nature of things for Roland Dumass father a civil servant in Limoges had been a member of the Resistance and had hidden Jews He had been caught arrested and shot on the same day that Serge Klarsfelds father died in Auschwitz March 26 1944 So this kind of past experience this kind of coincidence was if you will the unseen scaffolding of the trial And when as sometimes happened distinctions were made between the suffering of the Jews and the suffering of the Resistance people Roland Dumas was not prepared to accept those distinctions for in September 1944 after the Germans had left Limoges and when he was 21 he had helped dig up a mass grave outside the city of 24 men who had been shot His father was in that mass grave and so were other Resistance fighters and Jews It had not occurred to anyone to make separate piles They all had their mouths open and their mouths were filled with dirt TO UNDERSTAND WHAT happened at Izieu the second crime against humanity with which Barbie was charged it helped to remember French history I walked up the steep Fourviere hill in the center of Lyons and visited the basilica at the top At the start of the FrancoPrussian war of 1870 the people of Lyons promised God to build a church in honor of the Virgin Mary if the city was spared from invasion Lyons was spared and the basilica built but the war cost France the eastern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine A man named Lucien Bourdon was born in Lorraine in 1906 which meant that he was born a German and attended German schools Later he and his wife fled the Wehrmacht and went west settling on a farm near Izieu During the Occupation it was known that Bourdon was friendly with the Germans who were garrisoned in the nearby town of Belley Sabina Zlatin a woman born in Poland ran a childrens home in Izieu with her husband One day Bourdon asked the husband Do you have a big boy who could give me a helping hand The Zlatins sent over 15yearold Fritz Lobmann who was tall for his age and had a false ID card in the name of Francois Loban Probably Fritz Lobmann left a letter lying around the Bourdons house in any case Bourdon found out that he and the other children at the home were Jewish Word of what he had learned reached Barbie who ordered a raid Bourdon sent Fritz Lobmann back to the Zlatins saying he didnt need the boy after all because it was the off season A week later on April 6 1944 the Germans raided the house The day after that Bourdon and his wife were moved back to Lorraine Barbie ordered the children of Izieu to be taken away in trucks and deported to camps The song the 44 children sang in defiance as they rode in the trucks came from their history lessons Vous naurez pas lAlsace et la Lorraine You will not have the Alsace and the Lorraine BUT IF ANYTHING SHOWS how a system was revealed as truly crazed it is the story of the last train from Lyons to Auschwitz the third and last crime against humanity with which Barbie was charged By Aug 11 1944 when the train left the Germans defeat was certain They were retreating on all fronts hastily destroying documents hoping to find trains trucks and gasoline to get safely home Deportations to concentration camps had practically stopped In August 50 people were deported from Nice and 50 from St Etienne In all of France only one train left later than the one from Lyons on Aug 18 from Paris under the orders of the war criminal Alois Brunner who is still at large and living in Damascus In Lyonss prison of Montluc there were more than 1000 Jews and members of the Resistance Barbie testified in the pretrial proceedings that he got a telex from Paris on Aug 10 which has not been found ordering their deportation Even at that late stage of the war trains for deportation had priority over troop trains Instead of feeling the apathy of defeat of whats the use Barbie was seized with a manic energy and was determined to find a train for one final deportation Perhaps he was thinking of his promotion to captain which in fact came through that November six months before the end of the war in Europe He found a train with enough room for 650 persons who were rounded up in the Montluc courtyard on the morning of Aug 11 Two eyewitnesses inmates of Montluc swore they saw Barbie in the courtyard taking roll call although one said she saw him in uniform and the other in civilian dress In the afternoon the train left with the passengers segregated into three groups Jews men of the Resistance and women of the Resistance An SS officer asked one the prisoners Do you know where you are going    Youll be among yourselves en famille And he laughed The train zigzagged and backtracked waited at switches and picked its way through the wartime maze It took four days to cover roughly 150 miles between Lyons and the town of Vittel There the train stopped for three days waiting for clearance In the August heat the prisoners had been denied water but the head of the Red Cross in Vittel was allowed to feed and water them Tables were placed on the station platform and set with hot soup and sandwiches biscuits and cigarettes The prisoners were let out to breathe fresh air and eat their first meal since they had left Lyons Then a little further eastward in Epinal they were given little toilet kits containing toothbrushes and toothpaste In Strasbourg the car carrying the men of the Resistance was uncoupled and rerouted to the camp of Struthof And at Struthof as the witness Rene Picard recalled there was an SS officer at a desk in charge of the triage separating those who would go to the work camp from those who would be gassed He was working from index cards that had been sent from Lyons On some of the cards Picard saw the notation NN Nacht und Nebel The rest of the train crossed the border into Germany When it stopped at Stuttgart loudspeakers announced Jewish train everyone leave the station But there were still German civilians in the station mothers with their children who spat at the prisoners when they were let off to stretch their legs And one of the prisoners that the German children spat on was 15yearold Charlotte Wardy who was not much older than they were The car with the women of the Resistance was uncoupled and sent to Ravensbruck and the Jews went on to Auschwitz which they reached on Aug 22 Of the 308 Jews who arrived 128 were gassed before even being enrolled at the camp Charlotte Wardy was not gassed and one day in the camp she saw behind the barracks a sort of ditch filled with a greenblack liquid She picked up a stone and threw it into the ditch and a greasy greenish slime came to the surface A man who was walking by said with real anger Dont ever do that again and it was then that she realized that the ditch came from the direction of the crematorium WHEN THE three judges and nine jurors returned at 1210 AM on July 4 from their six hours of deliberation and Barbie was brought in seeming to come up through a trap door into the courtroom his handcuffs were removed He stood there with his hands in his jacket pockets like a man waiting for a bus listening to the guilty verdict silent and expressionless head bent close to one of his interpreters a woman in a flowered dress There were no mitigating circumstances The jurors reportedly said of the defense lawyers implausible defense arguments Il nous a pris pour des cons He took us for fools I had to remind myself that this balding elderly fellow with his sunken cheek close to the interpreters was an evil man who had sent children to their deaths  that he had not simply obeyed orders but had initiated operations such as Izieu on his own What was the nature of evil in his case Careerism run rampant I think the absolute and eager loyalty of the company man It wasnt how many insurance policies you sold but how many Jews you deported He wanted to be well thought of by his superiors to be Gestapo Man of the Year to rise within the system without once questioning the systems essential wrongness He was comfortable inside a system where he could express under orders the pathology of his nature Maybe he deserved the death sentence he had so often handed out himself But in Lyons 40 years and more after the events there was no death penalty and no special tribunal  just a normal French court and the customary life sentence And that may have been fitting after all I remember the testimony of the witness Pierre Durand when he told of the day Buchenwald was liberated We the inmates took 220 German prisoners he said But we locked them up and delivered them to the American Army intact and they were all assassins That was the difference between them and us THE CHILDREN OF IZIEU IN THE ATTIC ESPECIALLY THE MARKS OF those who had lived in the house are still in evidence Here on April 6 1944 in the village of Izieu 51 Jews 44 of them children between the ages of 4 and 17 were arrested by the Lyons Gestapo on the orders of Klaus Barbie The existence of this safehouse which had been established a year earlier by a Polishborn nurse named Sabina Zlatin was betrayed by a neighbor Mme Zlatin now 80 and living in Paris was away at the time of the raid Of those at home on the morning of April 6 only one Leon Reifman an assistant to Mme Zlatin escaped One child the only nonJew was released Everyone else was deported With one exception a 25yearold teacher all were later killed most at Auschwitz These pictures of the house at Izieu were taken during the Barbie trial by the celebrated photographer Marc Riboud a native of Lyons who served in the Resistance The house should be turned into a memorial he says Something should remind us
THE NATION; Curbing Funds for Abortion Advice,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/weekinreview/the-nation-curbing-funds-for-abortion-advice.html,Throughout his Administration President Reagan has made it clear that he believes abortion is wrong While members of the antiabortion movement have been heartened to have an ally in the White House they have been frustrated that there is still no Human Life Amendment extending Constitutional protection to the unborn Last week in a speech to a cheering group of antiabortion advocates Mr Reagan proposed policy changes that would insure that clinics offerring abortion counseling do not receive Federal funds The current regulations dictate the reverse Family planning clinics that get Federal money must at least mention abortion as one solution to unwanted pregnancy The new regulations would not only turn this rule inside out but also would require family planning clinics to keep the performance of abortions physically separate from the part of the clinic financed by the Government And Mr Reagan called on Dr C Everett Koop the Surgeon General to develop a solid body of health information on the effects of abortion While the Administration insists that its proposed restrictions are within the law supporters of abortion rights denounced them as a violation of medical ethics and doctors First Amendment rights and prepared to fight the change in Congress and the courts The Administration may wish to circumvent Congress by doing through regulation what it cannot get through legislation said Representative Bill Green Republican from New York But it will have a harder time getting around the Bill of Rights

WASHINGTON TALK: THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS; NO GRASS IS GROWING UNDER JUDGE BORK'S FEET,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/04/us/washington-talk-confirmation-process-no-grass-growing-under-judge-bork-s-feet.html,The White House believes it has found a secret weapon in its campaign to win Senate confirmation for its Supreme Court nominee Robert H Bork That weapon is Robert H Bork Judge Bork appeared in public only a few minutes a month ago standing silently by President Reagans side as Mr Reagan announced the nomination of the man he called the nations most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint The nominees next public appearance will be his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled to start Sept 15 But if Judge Bork who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals here is not exactly out on the stump neither is he sitting by passively while the national debate that was started by his nomination builds toward a crescendo He is available almost instantly to any senator who wants to see him By the time of the hearings he will have met individually with nearly all 14 members of the Judiciary Committee and with many if not most of the other 86 senators as well He has also given a number of ontherecord newspaper interviews Discussion of his current legal views is offlimits but the portrait that emerges from most interviews is of an intellectually restless scholar whose views have evolved in the past and might evolve some more His statement to an interviewer from Legal Times a Washingtonbased weekly that I dont consider myself a conservative left some of his opponents who regard him as a conservative of the most doctrinaire sort gnashing their teeth in frustration One White House adviser said that even without the senators insistence Judge Bork is virtually certain to be more open with the committee both because there is such a long written record of his views and because of his personality Each nominee is different said this adviser who has observed many nominees including the man who is now Chief Justice William H Rehnquist Bork is unlike Rehnquist Hes a lot looser This nomination will ride on the hearings and he is our secret weapon Judge Borks meetings with senators have been in many cases substantive encounters not the platitudinous courtesy visits that tradition deems adequate Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who is an outspoken advocate of abortion rights said he had asked Judge Bork how he would have voted had he been a Justice when the Court decided Roe v Wade the case that recognized abortion as a constitutional right A Hypothetical Question Judge Bork said he would have dissented Senator Packwood then posed a hypothetical question if in the days before Roe v Wade Judge Bork had been hired by a pregnant woman to bring a lawsuit to declare a state abortion law unconstitutional what legal theory would he have used Judge Bork said he wasnt sure The Court based its holding in Roe v Wade on the right to privacy a constitutional doctrine Judge Bork has rejected I asked him about the value of precedent Senator Packwood recounted in an interview He said certain precedents were so fixed some issues so settled that regardless of how you felt about them you shouldnt vote to overrule them He did not include Roe v Wade in that category Senator Packwood a lawyer who is not on the Judiciary Committee said he realized during the discussion of precedent that he had not done enough homework for the session Judge Bork cited a case the Senator did not recognize He Came the Next Morning I wasnt prepared he said I had called him expecting an appointment in a few days but he came the next morning Im going to have to do some reading and meet with him again Senator Packwood said the encounter was very pleasant very amiable even when he informed Judge Bork that unless Im reasonably convinced that he will vote to affirm Roe v Wade I will vote against him when the nomination reaches the floor of the Senate Another Senator Dennis DeConcini a conservative Democrat from Arizona who is a member of the Judiciary Committee said he was equally blunt with the nominee I told him he had problems Senator DeConcini said but that he could maybe overcome them if he was forthcoming with the committee if he let us know how he thinks and who he is At hearings last summer on the confirmation of Justice Rehnquist as Chief Justice and of Antonin Scalia as a new member of the Court Senator DeConcini criticized both men for refusing to express their views on any subject that might come before the Court For the forthcoming hearings however Senator DeConcini said Judge Bork had promised to go along with a detailed exploration of his views He said I agree you need to know how Ive come to the conclusions I have  the Senator said Under the general guidance of Howard H Baker Jr the White House chief of staff the stage manager of the campaign to win confirmation for Judge Bork is Tom C Korologos a longtime adviser to Republican Presidents who is president of Timmons  Company a lobbying concern here He first met Judge Bork after the Saturday night massacre in 1973 As the Nixon Administrations Senate lobbyist Mr Korologos shepherded Mr Bork who as Solicitor General had carried out President Nixons order to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor to numerous Senate committee hearings Mr Korologos enjoying an easy familiarity with nearly all senators has handled several touchy confirmations for the Reagan Administration including those of Chief Justice Rehnquist Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Kenneth L Adelman who is about to leave as the director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency For Judge Bork he is planning three sessions that he calls murder boards mock committee hearings that will prepare the nominee for the real thing The purpose is not to give him the answers Mr Korologos said in an interview He knows the answers The purpose is to give him the questions to create an atmosphere where hell be prepared for anything they throw at him Judge Borks training will include special preparation on the particular interests and questioning style of each member of the committee The best textbook Mr Korologos said is the transcript of the Rehnquist confirmation hearings last year Help From Unexpected Quarters The Bork campaign has received help from unexpected quarters including Justice John Paul Stevens himself a moderate on the Court who told a meeting of Federal judges last month that he would vote to confirm Judge Bork Perhaps the biggest surprise  and so far the biggest setback to the antiBork effort  was an OpEd page essay in The New York Times by Lloyd N Cutler a Washington lawyer and former counsel to President Carter who virtually exemplifies the Democratic establishment If asked Mr Cutler plans to testify on behalf of Judge Bork whom he portrayed as a selfrestrained moderate Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming the Republican whip quickly had the article printed in the Congressional Record and President Reagan quoted it approvingly last week A 25Year Paper Trail Senator Edward M Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat said over the weekend that the effort to depict Judge Bork as a moderate was nothing more than a preposterous public relations campaign to change Mr Borks spots Judge Borks opponents now see their principal task as using the nominees own words to prove the moderate characterization wrong Theres a 25year paper trail said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights which is coordinating much of the opposition activity That cant be shredded

PERSONAL FINANCE; The Cost of Entering the Baby Chase,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/09/business/personal-finance-the-cost-of-entering-the-baby-chase.html,MANY people contemplating adoption have heard stories of bills totaling 20000 and more  a cost that few can afford Prospective adoptive parents should not despair however Adoptions need not cost dearly with careful screening of the options available the final bill will more likely run between 5000 and 12000 Questions of price aside the adoption route may not be easy With increasing numbers of couples having trouble conceiving  experts estimate that as many as one out of every six couples of reproductive age suffers infertility problems  interest in adoption runs high SpenceChapin for instance one of the East Coasts largest adoption agencies gets at least 2000 phone calls a year about the 300 children it will place And as the demand for adoptable infants increases the number of American newborns put up for adoption has shrunk with the legalization of abortion and the lessening of the stigma attached to single motherhood We estimate there are about two million people wanting to adopt in the country today said Jeffrey Rosenberg director of public policy for the National Committee for Adoption a Washingtonbased association of private nonprofit adoption agencies Thats a lot for 20000 healthy infants Those 20000 healthy infants make up only part of the 50000 adoptions of nonfamily or stepfamily members that take place each year Mr Rosenberg estimates Another 20000 are what professionals describe as specialneeds children typically defined as youngsters who are physically or emotionally disabled groups of two or more siblings minority children and those who are schoolage or older The remaining 10000 are foreignborn coming primarily from Korea and other Asian countries as well as from Latin America Adoptions can be arranged in three ways through private agencies public agencies or independently without an agency Private nonprofit agencies licensed by the state place about half of the healthy infants adopted each year Mr Rosenberg said many handle international and specialneeds adoptions State city or county departments of social service handle public agency adoption These are almost exclusively adoptions of specialneeds children in the foster care system fees are seldom involved Independent adoptions are ones in which no agency is involved Usually these are arranged between the adoptive parents and the pregnant woman in consultation with an attorney Reports of twoyear waiting lists and requirements regarding age and length of marriage discourage many couples from pursuing an agency adoption But for others independent adoption  where mothers have been known to decide to keep the baby after all  seems too risky Regardless of the route chosen the final cost should be about the same said Aaron Britvan chairman of the Adoption Committee of the Nassau County Bar Association A survey of 120 private agencies belonging to the National Committee for Adoption found the average fee to be 7731 Independent adoptions can run somewhat higher depending on the expectant mothers expenses International adoptions came to about 5500 each  a reflection of the lower costs abroad of caring for the pregnant woman Specialneeds adoptions were less than 1000 These are the most vulnerable kids Mr Rosenberg said and if the adoptive parents cant swing the fee often its waived If the child has been in the public welfare system or is handicapped Medicaid will often cover medical expenses Further specialneeds children  whether adopted through a private agency or through a staterun public agency  carry with them small state subsidies to help defray the added costs of caring for them The amount of the subsidy will vary among individual counties and states said Peter Winkler director of the State Adoption Service for New York but in New York the average subsidy is about 300 Some private agencies charge no fee for their services Mr Rosenberg said others use sliding scales according to income The highest fee charged in the survey was 14000 for adoptive parents with annual income over 90000 Several set flat fees for all adoptive parents The highest in the survey was 8500 A nonmember agency the Golden Cradle in Cherry Hill NJ sets a flat fee for local couples at 10500 applicants from out of state pay slightly more Such fees cover only about twothirds of what an agency actually spends for administrative costs counseling programs and expenses involving the pregnant woman In Pennsylvania a recent State Supreme Court ruling has questioned the legality of agencies charging adoptive parents fees to cover these services Mr Rosenberg said As a result he said adoption in Pennsylvania is close to the verge of collapse Agency fees for international adoptions usually include transportation and escort service for the child visa and passport costs and legal costs in the country of origin For both international and domestic adoption parents should expect to pay separately for legal fees  which start at around 350  for making the adoption final WHEN choosing an agency shop around Mr Rosenberg said Ask How many adoptions a year do you do What is the waiting time And ask about the fees You should be skittish about anybody who is vague about what their fees are or who asks you for money up front without an indication of what the money is for That doesnt mean it is a bad agency but it is a red flag Be sure too to get recommendations from others who have used the agency and dont be shy about asking to see the annual report Find out about application fees and the costs for an initial consultation the latter can run anywhere from 50 to 150 Ask what the agencys fees cover  if the home study to determine if you would provide a suitable environment is not included it will cost you an extra 350 to 600  and ask if there are other requirements as well At the Golden Cradle for instance adoptive parents are expected to be able to provide housing for several months for one of the pregnant women planning to give up her baby for adoption This will not be the mother of the baby the couple adopts however In establishing the parents fiscal stability some agencies require copies of income tax returns from previous years others ask to see bank statements or other documentation and most ask detailed questions not so much about annual income as about how much debt you have and other issues of financial management Some agencies have age limits and others will not accept applicants who are single For those people however there is an alternative Independent adoption More on that next week

Bork Represents A Threat to Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/opinion/bork-represents-a-threat-to-women.html,LEAD Why are many women so troubled by President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the United States Supreme Court Because Senate confirmation of Judge Bork could jeopardize a generation of progress toward securing basic freedoms and legal equality for American women Why are many women so troubled by President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the United States Supreme Court Because Senate confirmation of Judge Bork could jeopardize a generation of progress toward securing basic freedoms and legal equality for American women No one should be beguiled by the campaign to present Judge Bork as a mainstream conservative or even a closet moderate whose flamboyant opinions would be tempered if he ascended to the Court His own writings belie this His concept of judicial restraint is alarmingly unrestrained Much public discussion has focused on his fierce hostility to Roe v Wade the landmark 1973 case that struck down state laws prohibiting abortion and affirmed each womans right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy Since Judge Bork could provide the fifth Court vote to overturn Roe v Wade this vital guarantor of womens right to control their reproductive lives is now imperiled But this is not a singleissue concern Judge Borks approach to legal analysis rejects the whole concept of reproductive rights He finds no constitutional basis for a 1965 Supreme Court decision in Griswold v Connecticut which in striking down a Connecticut ban on contraceptives for married people recognized an area of privacy and personal liberty outside the Governments purview According to Judge Bork under the Constitution Congress and the states may freely regulate the most intimate aspects of womens and mens lives For instance a state could prohibit or mandate various means of birth control could proscribe some types of living arrangements and could intervene in family relationships and decisions about childrearing  without deference to individuals values minorities beliefs or the general benefits of cultural diversity There is also cause for grave concern about Judge Borks legal philosophy in another evolving area of constitutional law equal protection Increasingly the Court has interpreted this basic guarantee to nullify laws that treat women and men differently  for example in setting Social Security benefits Heightened judicial scrutiny of such discriminatory laws could be another casualty of Judge Borks view that the Constitution is rigid and unreponsive to changes in national conscience and belief All in all Judge Borks narrow interpretation of the Constitution could eliminate the most important 20th century gains for women  except the right to vote His supporters maintain that womens apprehension on these grounds is unjustified for two reasons First they suggest that Judge Borks commitment to judicial restraint will lead him to respect established precedents even if he disagrees with them So far his pronouncements as professor and jurist give little promise of that kind of enlightened philosophical conservatism Second it is argued that progressives should welcome instead of fear judicial deference to Congress and the states because public opinion has advanced and legislatures have become far more supportive of womens rights and sensitive to personal liberties It is true that in the great sweep of recent history public attitudes toward womens rights and equal opportunities have changed dramatically However this progress has been frustratingly inconsistent from year to year and state to state especially in the field of reproductive rights For every state that provides public payment for abortions for poor women there is another state poised to ban or severely restrict abortions if Roe v Wade is reversed Even now states such as Pennsylvania keep jabbing at the boundaries of Roe v Wade by proposing new barriers to access to abortion A Supreme Court retreat would make womens ability to control their fertility and their lives once again a function of residence income and each years election results In an era of unsettling change and fervent debate about social values and policies it is doubly vital to affirm and respect settled law affecting sexuality reproduction and family relationships From this perspective Judge Borks refusal to recognize any realm of personal privacy and autonomy should be troubling to conservatives and liberals alike Is it proper for the Senate to consider such philosophical problems in considering a Supreme Court nomination Certainly Indeed the Senate would be shirking its constitutional responsibility  and undermining its own record of regard for womens equality and rights  if it meekly acceded to the Presidents controversial choice In light of Judge Borks record and writings confirmation would represent a grave step backward for the Senate and the country
Books of the Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/books/books-of-the-times-497987.html,YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS By Joyce Carol Oates 436 pages E P Dutton 1995 THE title of Joyce Carol Oatess 18th novel You Must Remember This comes of course from the song As Time Goes By but there are no love songs and little moonlight in this book only lots of passion jealousy and hate Love for the characters in this novel is not about romance or redemption rather its a kind of obsession a bloodheavy extinction of their minds which undermines their already precarious hold on reality and draws them closer and closer to madness and death As in much of Ms Oatess previous fiction acts of emotional and physical violence proliferate throughout the text Grandfather Stevick walks out on his wife and children to take up with a showgirl then blows his brains out in a hospital bed His illegitimate son Felix will think about running head on into an abutment on the expressway his other son Lyle will contemplate hanging himself and in the opening pages of the novel Lyles daughter Enid Maria will try to kill herself by taking an overdose of aspirin In addition to these suicide attempts there are several beatings an abortion an incestuous rape a terrible boxing mishap and a couple of car accidents Though the sheer accumulation of these events has a certain numbing effect on the reader there is nothing gratuitous or contrived about them As expertly dramatized by Ms Oates they not only underline the characters fears about the randomness of life but they also project a fierce vision of America during the 1950s  an America still reeling from the revelations of the death camps in World War II an America rocked by the Rosenberg case the McCarthy hearings and new anxieties about the Bomb In fact as the novel progresses the characters private bewilderment becomes a mirror of a larger public sense of dislocation their sense of being overwhelmed a reflection of our inability to fully comprehend modern history In this respect certainly You Must Remember This recalls Ms Oatess highly acclaimed novel Them 1969 in which the disorders in her characters lives converge with the Detroit riots of 1967 and like that earlier novel Remember is similarly grounded in a rich Balzackian matrix of social detail Indeed with Remember and her last novel Marya A Life Ms Oates seems to have returned to the storytelling impulses that animated her first books and in the wake of her uneven experiments with genre fiction Bellefleur A Bloodsmoor Romance and Mysteries of Winterthurn the result is a most felicitous one Whereas such earlier novels as With Shuddering Fall Them and Wonderland held the authors penchants for the naturalistic and the Gothic in an uneasy balance Remember welds them together to create a portrait of family life in the 50s that is both recognizable and horrifying mundane and disturbing While it cuts back and forth in time to show us three generations of the Stevick family You Must Remember This is principally concerned with the youngest daughter Enid Maria Enid is a strange watchful child at once the model student and obedient daughter  and a cynical sexually precocious brat Perched on the brink of adolescence she is initiated into the confusions and cruelties of the adult world by her uncle Felix a former boxer whos taken his brash arrogance from the ring and turned it on the world at large Felix seduces Enid when she is 14 and as she grows increasingly obsessed with him it becomes apparent that she is another one of those Oatesian victims whose passivity acts as a magnet for destruction Though Felix is cold manipulative and cruel Enid is totally dependent on him and soon cannot conceive of life without him So long as Enid knew she would be seeing him again she was all right writes Ms Oates What mattered was the continuity the promise She had her own life  she was quite satisfied with her own life  held together by her love for Felix the way a pearl necklace is held together by something so simple and crude as mere string You look and see the pearls you never see the string but without the string the pearls break and scatter Writing in powerful meticulous prose Ms Oates conjures up for the reader the physical passion shared by Felix and Enid with the same brutalizing immediacy that she lavishes on the scenes of Felix boxing in the ring We are made to see the dark chaotic currents of guilt anger and eroticism that run beneath the seemingly placid surface of the Stevicks lowermiddleclass existence and in doing so we are also given a glimpse of the enormous gap between appearance and reality that exists in their lives both the bourgeois hypocrisy that colors their acts for instance Felix objecting to Enids sisters plans to become a nightclub singer when he himself is dating showgirls and their futile efforts to reconcile their dreams of safety and their intimations of disaster Enid whom weve seen engaged in the simple rites of girlhood having her ears pierced putting Noxema on a sunburn copying hairdos out of Screen World will trade her youthful fantasies of romance for an ugly abortion and a weary cynicism Her father will realize that all his efforts to protect his family from dispensing advice to building a bomb shelter in the backyard cant prevent his loved ones from drifting away Unable to cope with what has happened to them these characters adopt the policy that the wisest procedure is simply to forget  something that the reader mesmerized by Ms Oatess masterly storytelling cannot easily do

Biden and His Party Risking High Stakes In Fight Over Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/12/us/biden-and-his-party-risking-high-stakes-in-fight-over-bork.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on President Reagans nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court scheduled to begin Sept 15 may profoundly affect not only the Courts ideological balance but also the 1988 Presidential campaign In the skirmishing over the nomination much of the political attention has been focused on Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the committee chairman who is also a leading Democratic Presidential hopeful His candidacy has already suffered although the Senator insisted today in San Francisco that the damage is not lasting and the weeks ahead will confront Mr Biden with as many pitfalls as shining opportunities The political ramifications extend far beyond Mr Biden The hearings on the Bork nomination and the debate and vote in the Senate a process that could last through November will almost certainly help to shape the way the nation looks at the Democratic Party and its standardbearer whether that is Mr Biden or one of his many rivals Aiming for the Mainstream For the last three years since their crushing defeat in 1984 when Walter F Mondale is thought to have been hurt by his close ties to many interest groups the Democrats have been trying to concentrate on mainstream issues such as the economy and foreign policy They have been trying in other words to stay away from the social issues such as abortion and gun control that have pushed many bluecollar Democrats toward the Republicans The Bork debate could reestablish the links between such issues and the Democratic Party in the mind of the electorate Some of the issues on which Judge Bork has been most hotly criticized are abortion civil rights and civil liberties and some of the groups that are most vigorously fighting his nomination are seen by moderate and rightwing Democrats as uncomfortable allies for a Presidential campaign in this era At the same time some of those outside forces arrayed against Judge Bork could mobilize their backers in ways that could help push one Democrat to the head of the crowded nomination contest and could provide enthusiastic volunteer support in an election race too Senator Biden himself a declared foe of Judge Bork said last month that he his committee and his Democratic colleagues in the Senate had to be careful not to dwell too much on any one issue in attacking Judge Borks fitness to serve on the Supreme Court Otherwise he said the Democrats will be seen as the party of special interests as a singleissue vehicle  precisely what they have been trying to avoid and what they did avoid for the most part in their successful bid to recapture control of the Senate last year Speech to Bar Association Speaking with reporters this afternoon in San Francisco where he addressed the meeting of the litigation section of the American Bar Association the Senator contended that no lasting damage had been done to his campaign because the attention of the American people had been elsewhere His comments appeared to represent an effort to counter repeated assertions by political professionals that his 1988 effort had run into serious trouble Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee another of the Democratic Presidential candidates has yet to state a position on Judge Bork In fact he recently criticized Mr Biden for having done so comparing him and other Democrats who have already declared their positions to the Queen in Alice in Wonderland who said Sentence first  verdict afterwards Mr Gore his aides report is concerned that a seeming failure by the Democrats to give Judge Bork a fair hearing will hurt the party especially among the moderates and Southerners whose support he is hoping to attract in his own campaign A filibuster against the nomination a tactic that Mr Biden has declined to forswear could also harm the partys image especially if Judge Bork a man of considerable personal charm makes a compelling witness on television Democrats on the select Congressional committees investigating the Irancontra controversy have already discovered during the testimony of Lieut Col Oliver L North the danger of a witnesss putting tough interrogators on the defensive Two Others Face Decision Three Democratic Senators who are running for President  Mr Biden Mr Gore and Paul Simon of Illinois  will have to vote to confirm or not to confirm and two of them  Mr Biden and Mr Simon  will have to vote in committee as well Mr Simon has taken a relatively cautious position expressing serious reservations on the balance and sensitivity issues but promising to reserve final judgment until after the hearings Eddie Mahe one of the more experienced and knowledgeable Republican political consultants asserts that the Bork nomination may save his party in 1988 by demonstrating that the Democrats or at least their chief spokesmen are more liberal on social issues than Middle America is Other GOP strategists disagree But it is clear that the confirmation process offers Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader a chance to identify himself strongly in the public mind with the more conservative position on a whole range of social issues That could be a considerable asset to the Senator in his Presidential campaign He has been struggling to convince party conservatives who will have a large voice in choosing a nominee that he is as well attuned to their thinking as his main rivals Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of New York It will be up to Mr Dole as minority leader along with Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee to lead the fight on behalf of Judge Bork on the Senate floor It is Mr Biden though whose candidacy has been affected most so far In the judgment of the Washington political community  that group of insiders who focus on such things even in the dog days of August  the Delaware Senator has not helped himself The damage is not fatal most observers agree and Mr Biden may well be able to reverse it if he makes a good impression in the hearings But damage there certainly is Inconsistencies Have Surfaced He has put himself in an awkward position said a senior Democratic strategist who is uncommitted for 1988 He was in an ideal position but he has turned a big plus into a bigger question mark by acting like a hanging judge The difficulty Im afraid is that he doesnt think things through Hes so bright but he needs an edit button on his mind before he talks Most of the criticism of Mr Biden has centered on his inconsistent statements about Judge Bork In November in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer he responded to a hypothetical question with the comment Say the administration sends up Bork Id have to vote for him and if the groups tear me apart thats the medicine that Ill have to take On July 1 when Judge Bork was nominated to replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr Mr Biden said I will not now take a formal position A week later after meeting with civil rights groups the Delaware lawmaker shifted ground again declaring Most certainly Im going to be against him Then on July 18 in a joint appearance with the other Democratic candidates in Cleveland he said he had made a mistake in the way he had announced his opposition But on July 22 at a meeting with a group of reporters he said the mistake had been more of a publicrelations mistake than a substantive mistake and added I dont have an open mind I dont have an open mind because I know this man Verbosity Seen as a Danger The effect has been to reinforce the impression of Mr Biden as a man whose prolixity can get him in trouble An adviser to one of the other Democratic candidates reflecting his own partisan interests but also the judgment of many politicians said that Mr Biden needed to be on his guard during the hearings or hell talk too much and hell get carried away Mr Biden will probably have to give up some of his campaign days this fall in Iowa and New Hampshire with their crucial early tests of Democratic strength to concentrate on the Bork nomination But if his involvement has forced him to pay a price and will continue to do so it also has the potential to show him as a statesman tending to the nations business at a time when his rivals are out on the stump in pursuit of their own advancement
WASHINGTON TALK: SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/12/us/washington-talk-senate.html,Making a Federal Case of the Bork Nomination Nominally the major topic before the Senate for the last month has been Robert H Bork and his nomination to the Supreme Court But the way it has been handled the subject before the Senate has been well the Senate Senator after senator has taken the floor to deliver speeches that while barely mentioning President Reagans nominee are generously laced with quotations from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention the Federalist Papers and articles from law reviews Unsuspecting tourists stopping by the Senate gallery in the days before the August recess  the speeches are to continue when Congress reconvenes next month  could well have imagined they had wandered into a misplaced seminar in American history This is not an idle intellectual exercise however Rather it is an effort to stake out vital territory for the debate that will begin in earnest when Judge Bork goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee Sept 15 At issue is the role the Senate should play in the confirmation process and the criteria it should use in reaching its decision The Senate as CoEqual Partner The Democrats led by Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the chairman of the Judiciary Committee argue that in acting on a judicial nomination the Senate is the Presidents coequal partner In giving the Senate the role of providing advice and consent Senator Biden said in a speech last month the framers intended the Senate to take the broadest view of its constitutional responsibility including the duty to scrutinize a judicial nominees political legal and constitutional views Senator Biden has already announced his intention to vote against Judge Bork Other Democratic senators who say they have not yet decided how they will vote including Wyche Fowler of Georgia and Terry Sanford of North Carolina have also made speeches defending an active role for the Senate The Republicans have taken the opposite view They argue that the Senate is essentially limited to assuring itself of the nominees professional competence and personal integrity and that anything further constitutes in the words of Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah a political inquisition that threatens the independence of the Supreme Court Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming the Republican whip said in response to Senator Bidens speech that those who do not like Judge Bork should simply say so instead of somehow trying to shroud the political partisan and special interest opposition in some type of vapid rationalization or some ponderous historical perspective That comment provoked Senator Sanford a former president of Duke University to observe that he did not view the study and discussion of constitutional law and history to be some type of vapid rationalization or some ponderous historical perspective  but rather as essential to the responsible exercise of our duty as US Senators There is more at stake here than a question of institutional prerogative Judge Borks professional credentials are beyond dispute He is a former Yale Law School professor and United States Solicitor General and he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate five years ago to be a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals here So if the Senates role in the confirmation process is defined as narrowly as the Republicans say it should be the battle is over before it has even begun Judge Borks opponents believe they can defeat him by showing how his conservative judicial philosophy would reverse the direction of constitutional law in such areas as civil rights privacy abortion churchstate relations and citizen access to the courts But before the opponents can even offer those arguments they must first make the case that such an effort is within the Senates legitimate role Public Seems to Agree A majority of the public appears to agree with the Democrats that the Senate should examine the views as well as the competence of a Supreme Court nominee Sixtytwo percent of 745 people questioned by telephone in a New York TimesCBS News Poll July 2122 said the senators should pay a lot of attention to a nominees positions on major constitutional issues with only 31 percent saying the Senate should pay little or no attention to judicial philosophy The margin of sampling error in the poll was plus or minus four percentage points But the Bork opponents are taking no chances People for the American Way a liberal organization that is assuming a leading role in the campaign against confirmation has run a series of radio and newspaper advertisements urging senators to take a very close look at Robert Bork and pointing out that throughout history the Senate has rejected one out of every five Supreme Court nominees Drafts of the Constitution throughout most of the convention in Philadelphia gave the Senate the sole power to make judicial appointments The decision to permit the President to nominate subject to the Senates advice and consent was a lastminute compromise On the Senate floor the debate has exemplified both the potential and the pitfalls of combing through history to discern what is usually called the original intent of those who framed the Constitution Similar Citations Speakers on both sides of the aisle cite some of the same documents selecting those phrases that serve their case best No 76 of the Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton is a popular text Senator Biden arguing for an active Senate role quoted Hamiltons observation that Senate review of judicial nominations was needed to keep the President from appointing judges to be the obsequious instruments of his pleasure Senator Bob Dole the Republican leader looking elsewhere in the same Federalist Paper quoted Hamilton as saying that the President was to be the principal agent in selecting judges with the Senate limited to preventing the appointment of unfit characters Senator Fowler then entered the debate noting that although Hamilton may have taken such a limited view of the Senate role he was the leading proponent among the Framers of a strong  some would even say monarchical  executive and in any event was only one of the 55 framers of the Constitution Another of the framers John Rutledge of South Carolina came to have a more personal stake in the debate than he could have anticipated Rutledge argued strongly against giving the President unchecked power to make judicial appointments on the ground that the people will think we are leaning too much toward monarchy Eight years later George Washington nominated Rutledge to be Chief Justice The Senate angered by Rutledges opposition to the Jay Treaty with England turned him down on political grounds
Reagan Leaves Gaps In Discussion of Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/13/us/reagan-leaves-gaps-in-discussion-of-bork.html,In reiterating his backing for Judge Robert H Bork for the Supreme Court President Reagan repeated tonight that none of Judge Borks 400 opinions had been overturned by the High Court But Mr Reagan did not mention that the Court has reviewed only about 10 of all the cases in which Judge Bork has participated and has ruled on none of the more than 100 cases on which Judge Bork has written majority opinions Judge Bork has criticized several landmark rulings of the Court including those requiring reapportionment of state legislatures on a one manone vote basis legalizing abortion and striking down state poll taxes Mr Reagan has already appointed two judges to the Court and if Judge Bork is approved he could swing the balance of the ninemember bench distinctly toward the conservative side Mr Reagan emphasized Judge Borks legal credentials and his advocacy of judicial restraint the philosophy that judges should not impose their own views on the law He pointedly did not mention the conservative influence Judge Bork could be expected to have
Poll Shows Bias Against Women in High Offices,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/13/us/poll-shows-bias-against-women-in-high-offices.html,Women who would be President face a significant bias among the American electorate a new poll has found with nearly a third saying a woman is less suited for the White House than a man But to look at the findings another way the poll also found widespread acceptance of women in politics even at the highest level half of the people said a woman would perform just as well in the White House as a man and 8 percent thought a woman would do better Our survey begins to put to rest the notion that women candidates are at a disadvantage simply because they are women said Irene Natividad the head of the National Womens Political Caucus Not so say a majority of the voters Many stereotypes about women as candidates by and large were shared by men and women alike  remarkably similar attitudes said Harrison Hickman the poll taker adding that men often held them more strongly In terms of women in politics sharper differences emerged among women according to their region education and age than emerged between men and women Geography Is a Factor The survey found that the bias against the idea of a woman in the White House was stronger among people outside urban areas those who were over 60 years old Southern white women and people with less than a college education By comparison those least resistant to a womans seeking the Presidency were Democrats blacks city residents younger voters unmarried voters and particularly women in all of those categories The new poll outlined a host of pitfalls and possibilities for women in politics three years after Geraldine A Ferraros nomination for Vice President and while Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado is considering a bid for her partys Presidential nomination in 1988 In general women were perceived to be more competent as politicians than men on a range of social and domestic issues such as day care education and helping the poor Compared with men they were more identified with such qualities as honesty and compassion Men on the other hand were perceived to be better at technical issues such as arms control and trade and were more identified with toughness and the ability to handle crises While much of this confirms previous polling the new survey found that women were given the edge in a new area holding the line on government spending which should be a considerable plus Ms Natividad said when the Federal deficit is a dominant issue The Phrasing Is Crucial The survey found that resistance to women tended to rise with the importance of the office People were asked Tell me whether you think a woman would do a better job the same job or whether a woman would not do as well as a man at carrying out the responsiblities of a range of positions from school board to President So for example 20 percent of the people thought that a woman would do a better job on a school board than a man would while 66 percent said a woman would perform the same as a man and 5 percent said she would not do as well When it came to the office of President the attitudes had changed 8 percent said she would do a better job 49 percent about the same and 31 percent not as well as a man The responses of men and women were very similar Harrison Hickman a poll taker with the firm of HickmanMaslin Research which helped conduct the poll said it was difficult to measure how these attitudes toward a woman in the White House had changed in recent years because the question had been phrased differently in different surveys Framing the question a different way the Gallup Poll has charted these attitudes for several years and found dramatic change When asked in July 1984 If your party nominated a woman for President would you vote for her if she were qualified for the job 78 percent said yes 17 percent no and 5 percent had no opinion By comparison 29 percent said they would not vote for such a woman in 1971 Survey by Telephone The survey released today was conducted by the firms of HickmanMaslin Research and American Viewpoint for the womens caucus and was based on telephone interviews with 1502 registered voters conducted May 26June 1 It had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points with the sampling error for women 3 percent and for men 4 percent For some questions on the survey the poll takers sought to correct for the tendency of respondents to give socially acceptable answers People were asked to make a choice between hypothetical candidates on the basis of a single characteristic such as knowing only that one was a Republican and the other a Democrat When offered a choice only on the basis of party 38 percent said they were more likely to support the Democrat 28 percent the Republican and 34 percent said that they did not know or that it made no difference But when given the same choice and with the sex of the candidate included in the question 24 percent of the respondents said they were more likely to support a female Democrat and 25 percent a male Republican Probing for Hidden Bias This combining of sex and partisanship clearly reveals the existence of an unspoken bias against women candidates the poll takers reported Male Democrats defeat female Republicans by 15 points in this matchup while female Democrats run one point behind the male Republican The survey however was conducted before Representative Schroeder began her Presidential activities and did not try to gauge such unspoken bias toward a woman in the White House As a result Mr Hickman said the bias against a woman in the Presidency is probably underreported The survey sought to gauge attitudes toward a number of womens issues When asked If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it should she be allowed to have an abortion or not it found that 56 percent said she should 23 percent said she should not and 21 percent said it depends But when asked about government funding for abortion that support weakened significantly 47 percent said they would oppose it as against 39 in favor When asked to choose between a candidate who supported the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution and one who did not 63 percent said they would choose the candidate who supported it 14 percent the one who opposed it And when asked to choose between a candidate who was endorsed by womens rights group and one who was opposed 53 percent said they would back the candidate with the endorsement 19 percent the one who was opposed Despite the support for such measures the survey found that women were much more likely to consider themselves conservatives than liberals  40 percent to 26 percent Men and Women as Candidates Perceived Differences Lets assume for a minute that all you know about two candidates for office is that one is a man and one is a woman For each of the following words and phrases tell me whether you would associate it more with the man candidate or the woman candidate Male Female No candidate candidate difference Speaks out honestly about issues

WASHINGTON TALK: THE WHITE HOUSE; Grumbles and Moans About Baker,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/13/us/washington-talk-the-white-house-grumbles-and-moans-about-baker.html,The tenure of Howard H Baker Jr as White House chief of staff has not been easy In trying to act as a buffer between the moderate and conservative factions that have long contended for power in the Reagan Administration he has acquired some painful bruises and disappointed some old friends in his first six months in office Baker was brought in to calm the waters said Senator William S Cohen a Maine Republican But underneath the surface all the currents and conflicts are still there Senator J James Exon a Nebraska Democrat said I cant imagine Howard Baker will put up with this for another 18 months If he does hes not the Howard Baker I know It was to a chorus of cheers that last February Mr Baker replaced Donald T Regan as the White House chief of staff Here it was said was a man of vast experience a master of compromise who would make President Reagan understand the need for flexibility and realism With Heels Dug In That is not what happened Instead of yielding to pleas for compromise the President has dug in his heels and said I wont retreat  a senior adviser said On issues ranging from the budget deficit and the financing of abortion to the Persian Gulf and the Supreme Court Mr Reagans views seem decidedly unchanged by the presence of Mr Baker the former Senate Republican leader Its very much a Reagan White House said the senior adviser Conservatives who have always doubted Mr Bakers rightwing credentials are overjoyed But among moderates in both parties the cheers for Mr Baker have turned to questions and complaints Senator Robert C Byrd the Democratic leader summed up a common feeling on Capitol Hill This is not the approach I expected and I have a feeling its not the approach wed be getting if Howard got his way Hes probably run into a rock wall of stubbornness and recalcitrance Last week the influence of Mr Baker seemed to emerge for the first time Instead of pushing ahead with a request for more military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels the President agreed to try the diplomatic route first joining Jim Wright the Speaker of the House in advancing a new peace plan for Central America Two days later the President issued new guidelines for informing Congress about covert operations trying to correct some flaws disclosed in the Irancontra investigation Part of it is just a matter of time said Senator David L Boren the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence You cant throw a train thats hurtling in one direction into reverse Now youre really seeing the impact of Howard Baker Conservatives Worried That is just what some conservatives are worried about Republican senators complain that the Presidents peace plan is aimed at selling out the contras Richard A Viguerie a leading rightwing polemicist issued said There are people in the White House who seem every bit as eager as liberal Democrats to abandon our allies to Communism His words were clearly aimed at Mr Baker who earned the undying enmity of conservatives a decade ago by supporting the treaties that ceded United States authority over the Panama Canal Kevin P Phillips a Republican political analyst said that to many the Presidents moves last week evoked bad memories of Panama Howie all over again But there is wide agreement on Capitol Hill that Mr Baker has improved the credibility of a White House that had been treating Congress with contempt and deceit In the Irancontra hearings the investigating committees had few complaints about White House cooperation Theres a good deal of confidence and good will toward Howard Baker said Senator George J Mitchell of Maine a Democratic member of the panel I cant imagine Howard Baker countenancing deliberate lies to Congress Senator Jake Garn a Utah Republican added Relations are a lot better between the White House and Congress The Administration is a lot more upfront about its intentions Nevertheless when many people on Capitol Hill talk about Mr Baker a primary theme is disappointment If the chief of staff had any real influence goes the argument the President would be seeking more compromises with Congress of the kind he advanced last week rather than a heavy dose of confrontation Inside the White House Mr Baker and his aides have heard the grumbling and are not happy about it A Republican strategist with close ties to the chief of staff said some Baker aides are saying in private What have we gotten ourselves into Howard was a charmed figure on Capitol Hill the strategist explained But now hes in a situation where confrontation is inevitable so of course its a little uncomfortable The first punch in the nose always hurts the worst Those close to Mr Baker point out that Mr Reagan is a stubborn man who believes deeply in a few basic principles and Mr Baker refuses to impose his views on the President The people on Capitol Hill who are disappointed in Howard Baker are those who expected him to change Ronald Reagan said a senior White House official Were doing more consultation than ever before with Congress but people dont like it because were reaching the same conclusions Ronald Reagan is not going to change he is the President and throughout his political career people have underestimated him Another reason for Mr Bakers behavior is that given his longstanding tensions with Republican conservatives he felt a strong need to protect his right flank and demonstrate his loyalty to the President In one sense the Baker team has been victimized by its own reputation As Senator Garn complained people expected miracles but miracles are hard to come by Washington sometimes sets expectations that nobody can reach said one of Mr Bakers closest confidants If the Baker team made one mistake he added it was not realizing that with all the hoopla of six months ago you were setting yourself up for a fall from grace when those expectations were not fulfilled Odds on the 88 Election Where does Mr Baker go from here The odds are long but he could still emerge in 1988 as a compromise candidate for President if the Republican convention becomes hopelessly snarled A recent Gallup poll said 50 percent of those surveyed regarded him as a stronger Presidential candidate than the announced field Another scenario has him becoming Secretary of State should the Republicans keep the White House And if Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court falters one replacement who could be guaranteed of confirmation would be the former Senate leader Meantime despite the pain Mr Baker has avoided the deepest fear of many politicians anonymity Even with the problems said a close Baker associate its better to be a central figure than to be forgotten
U.S. Won't Aid U.N. Population Unit,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/14/world/us-won-t-aid-un-population-unit.html,Over strong Congressional and internal objections the Agency for International Development announced today that it was again withholding its contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities because of charges that the fund supports coerced abortion in China The move strongly supported by opponents of abortion is mandated under a 1985 amendment that bars Federal money for groups that support coerced abortion or sterilization This is the second year in a row the agency has held back 25 million from the fund because of the charge involving China The agencys acting administrator Jay F Morris said the decision which had been expected for some time was made because of strong evidence that Chinas policy of encouraging one child per family is coercive He cited hundreds of Chinese radio broadcasts in which officials speak of banned second pregnancies and penalty measures for the conception of a second child Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that their programs force abortions No Evidence of Coerced Abortions The United Nations supports census efforts in China which may indirectly help coercive programs Mr Morris said He said the Chinese census efforts gave the Beijing Government information that it might use to plan coercive family planning But a top agency official said internal agency experts strongly opposed a cutoff in United States money A 1985 report by the agency found some abuses by local Chinese officials but no evidence that Chinas central Government or the fund supports coerced abortions Senator Daniel K Inouye Democrat of Hawaii the original sponsor of the 1985 amendment wrote to Secretary of State George P Shultz last month calling the accusations against the fund absurd and urging Mr Shultz to resist political pressures brought by opponents of family planning The United States Bureau of Census has itself trained Chinese demographers through its International Statistics Training Program Senator Inouye wrote He cited Mr Shultzs own testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1986 that it is our understanding the Chinese Government does not sanction coerced abortions This is more about votes in Peoria than women in China the agency official said In Opposition of Family Planning At the United Nations today the funds executive director Nafis Sadik attributed Americas decision to lobbying by Americans who oppose all family planning She said the loss of American money would force the fund to cut programs in subSaharan Africa the one region of the world where population growth is still rising and far outstrips food production We absolutely deny the charges Dr Sadik said We are particularly concerned with the critical situation in subSaharan Africa where she said the fund is trying to respond to Africas increasing demands for family planning and maternal and child health care The agency first withheld money from the fund because of the China charge in 1985 deducting 10 million of a 46 million contribution  an amount roughly equal to the funds spending that year in China The agency witheld all 25 million of the appropriated American contribution to the fund last year promising to spend the money on Americansponsored programs abroad The fund will spend 155 million this year in 133 countries Its projects in China include programs to produce and import contraceptives training for familyplanning experts and help for Chinese census programs Mr Inouye wrote that staff members of the Senate subcommittee on foreign operations concluded during an April trip to China that the central Chinese Government did not support coercive familyplanning measures Mr Inouye wrote We do not know of any documentary evidence of a program of coerced abortion in China

Cleric Seeks Wider Role for Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/us/cleric-seeks-wider-role-for-women.html,The leader of the nations largest Roman Catholic archdiocese declared today that sexist language and the exclusion of women from positions of power were alienating Catholic women from the faith In a pastoral letter issued today Archbishop Roger M Mahony of Los Angeles said women should be allowed to play a larger role in the church and called for changes in the language of key church teaching to display more sensitivity to womens concerns It is now more commonly recognized that terms such as man and mankind brothers and brethren  and references to God as He His and Him make many women feel excluded the letter said Rejection of Their Gifts The 51yearold archbishop the spiritual leader of an estimated three million Catholics in the Los Angeles archdiocese is known as a conservative on church doctrine who is liberal on some social causes particularly those that affect the Hispanic Catholics who make up 60 percent of his flock While stopping short of advocating women for the priesthood Archbishop Mahony urged that women be appointed to highlevel positions in the archdiocese and be allowed broader participation in religious services Women in professional groups lament the rejection of their gifts especially gifts for leadership he said adding that many women still find that some clergy view them with suspicion and fear because of cultural stereotypes that block honest communication with an allmale priesthood God Is Neither Male Nor Female The archbishop did not appear to be breaking new ground in his call for greater participation by women in the life of the church Many bishops including some regarded as conservatives have issued similar statements though some have gone farther than others in promoting women to positions of responsibility But Archbishop Mahonys criticism of sexist language could provoke a broader debate particularly his declaration We must recognize that God is neither male nor female Many Catholic women credit Archbishop Mahony with appointing more women to administrative roles in his two years in the archdiocese but more ardent feminists have denounced his adherence to official Vatican positions on abortion birth control and women in the priesthood A Courageous Statement However some Catholic women interviewed today said Archbishop Mahonys doctrinal orthodoxy gave his pastoral statement more force than the same words from a liberal bishop With a visit by the Pope John Paul II to Los Angeles only a month away some Catholic women dismissed Archbishop Mahonys letter as a gesture toward women Others read it as a far more significant act involving some risk to his positon in the church It is a courageous statement from someone in the hierarchy said Monika Hellwig a professor of theology at Georgetown University and a past president of the Catholic Theological Society of America Its much more than a public relations move because it could make things difficult for Archbishop Mahony The Issue of Language In his letter Archbishop Mahony said he had learned from meetings with Catholic women initiated by his precedessor Timothy Cardinal Manning that women still experienced alienation and rejection in the church He said divorced and unmarried women single mothers and women of little education were the most alienated and told pastors they should join him in welcoming the ministry of women in our parishes Most of the letter however was devoted to the issue of language including the words of some of the most fundamental Catholic statements In using the pronoun He in speaking about and writing about God we must recognize that God is neither male nor female Archbishop Mahony said Rather God is above or beyond our categories of masculine and feminine Words From Nicene Creed When people at prayer and worship he said are addressed as brethren and hear that the Gospel is good news and glad tidings for men of good will or that the Son of God came from heaven for us men and for our salvation more and more women feel themselves excluded More deeply some women actually wonder whether the fullness of salvation is really theirs if the language does not include them Archbishop Mahoneys reference to the words for us men and for our salvation comes from the Nicene Creed recited at the midpoint of every mass It is a statement of the basic beliefs of the church Some more liberal Catholics have taken to dropping the word men when they recite this passage Efforts to drop sexist language have been a source of discord in many American Protestant churches and in 1983 the National Council of Churches released a new translation of Bible readings

so loved the world that God gave Gods only Child that whoever believes in that Child should not perish but have eternal life
How Right-to-Lifers Promote Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/opinion/how-right-to-lifers-promote-abortion.html,African hospitals contain ward after ward of women convalescing from botched abortions One day those wards could be a thing of the past because of subSaharan Africas growing network of family planning clinics most of them underwritten by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Thanks to the Reagan Administration however that day may be cruelly long in coming Once again the Agency for International Development has withheld its contribution to the UNFPA charging spuriously that the fund supports coerced abortion in China The move has little to do with actually reducing abortion abroad and everything to do with obeisance to a militant political minority at home The agency bases its case for coerced abortion on Chinese radio broadcasts in which officials praise onechild families and warn of penalty measures for people who insist on larger families The Chinese have gone to persuasive lengths to reassure the world that those penalty measures arent forced abortions but government bonuses withdrawn from a onechild family if it has another followed by increasing penalty taxes for each succeeding birth Americans may not approve of Chinas efforts to limit its population growth but neither is their country home to more than a billion people a quarter of the worlds population A recent Congressional delegation to China reported no evidence of officially coerced abortions and a substantial decrease in abuse by local officials Secretary of State Shultz told the Senate Appropriations Committee last year that it is our understanding the Chinese Government does not sanction coerced abortions In any case the UNFPAs work in China involves only data collection and no Federal money whatsoever The Administrations seeming response to such telling testimony is Dont confuse us with the facts In Kenya meanwhile the UNFPAs aggressive promotions of family planning have helped to double the percentage of married couples practicing birth control in Zimbabwe the number has soared  from 14 to 39 percent The loss of American contributions slows these efforts For the sake of its ephemeral case against China Americas noisy minority of antiabortion activists has kept Federal funds out of the UNFPA since 1985 It has also helped keep Africas hospitals filled with victims of botched abortions
FILM; 'DIRTY DANCING' ROCKS TO AN INNOCENT BEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/movies/film-dirty-dancing-rocks-to-an-innocent-beat.html,KELLERMANS THE FICTIVE Catskills hotel that provides the setting for the new film Dirty Dancing is meant to be more than the sum of its parts which are golf gossip and gefilte fish It stands as a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963  orderly prosperous bursting with good intentions a sort of Yiddishinflected Camelot So when Frances Baby Houseman the doctors daughter at the films center loses both her virginity and her political naivete to a streetsmart dance teacher the collision should shake the audience too out of a certain complacency These at least are the intentions of Eleanor Bergstein the novelist Advancing Paul Newman who both wrote and coproduced Dirty Dancing which opens Friday at the Gemini Twin and National Twin It will be up to critics and the public to decide how well Ms Bergstein and the director Emile Ardolino have managed to embody such serious ideas in a movie that also aspires to be a summer divertissement  one part Flashdance one part Baby Its You To Ms Bergstein the two poles of the movie are consonant Growing up in Brooklyn she moved effortlessly from tutoring innercity students in the afternoon to shimmying in dirty dancing contests at night Similarly she says the rockandroll that subverts the dance floor etiquette at Kellermans during the film anticipates a whole array of exciting and disquieting things to come later in the 1960s  the antiwar movement the sexual revolution the uprisings in cities and on campuses I meant Dirty Dancing to be a celebration of the time of your life when you could believe that a kind of earnest liberal action could remake the world in your own image Ms Bergstein said in a recent interview in her Upper West Side apartment The film couldnt have been set a few months earlier or later The summer of 1963 was the first one after the Cuban missile crisis which everyone had been following on television The effect on kids was to make them very scared and for the first time very suspicious of their elders maybe things wouldnt work out all right But the thing that kept the optimism going was John Kennedy himself  young and energetic and sexy So maybe you could have it all It was the summer of the Peace Corps and the summer of the I Have a Dream speech It was like the last summer of liberalism Because two months after the movie is over JFK is assassinated And two months after that the Beatles are on the Ed Sullivan Show And after that its radical action Dirty Dancing had its genesis years ago in a more domestic image that fascinated Ms Bergstein  two daughters in the same family one raised to be beautiful the other brainy Gradually the writers notion of the sisters coalesced with her sense of how some people live through dance and popular music These ideas in turn dovetailed with Ms Bergsteins autobiographical recollections of Catskills summers dirty dancing contests and 1960s activism providing a narrative framework for the screenplay And by coproducing her own film Ms Bergstein retained a rare degree of leverage over its final form Unlike such recent films as The Big Chill or Volunteers  the first a look at disillusioned former college activists the second a sendup of the Peace Corps Dirty Dancing treats the idealism of the 1960s as a genuine expression of faith not a passing fad Baby Houseman plans to study the economics of the third world and to enter the Peace Corps Neil Kellerman the grandson of the hotels owner expects to join the Freedom Rides in the South after the summer season ends Almost everything about Kellermans attests to the heyday of New York Democratic Party liberalism Ms Bergstein based her characterization of Kellermans on memories of childhood summers spent at Grossingers the nowdefunct Catskills resort She evokes some of the more familiar elements of the Borscht Belt  the bad jokes the misguided matchmaking the hyperkinetic social directors known as tummlers  but with the affection of one who had shared in them I didnt want to make it ugly and vulgar Ms Bergstein said of Kellermans It was a world of grace and elegance and  yes  liberal values I remember that when my family went to the Catskills you had busboys who were going to take a semester off from college to go on the Freedom Rides When the three civil rights workers were killed in Mississippi there was a candlelight vigil But as Dirty Dancing shows in some moments and suggests in others places like Kellermans and by extension Kennedyera America could not sustain their placid satisfied existence Kellermans owners are watching their regulars die or drift away and the rigid class system that governs the hotels operation is beginning to break down When Baby Houseman Jennifer Grey follows a friendly bellboy to the staff quarters at Kellermans she wades into a bluecollar life of jackedup cars raunchy rockandroll and sneers at the affluent all of it personified by a dance instructor named Johnny Castle Patrick Swayze She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnnys pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort after having lied to her father to get 250 for the partners backroom abortion Babys father Jake Jerry Orbach ultimately learns of the ruse the abortion and his daughters burgeoning romance with Castle and the favored child Daddys girl has to stand on her own Baby becomes Frances Jake wanted Baby to go off to Southeast Asia and change the world not to fall in love with a lowermiddleclass dance instructor Ms Bergstein said Baby has grown up without ever living in the physical world as Wallace Stevens says And I think she learns that life isnt as easy as having good thoughts and putting one foot in front of the other Right and wrong is not so easy The plot unfolds to a carefully selected soundtrack Although Dirty Dancing includes a few new songs in a generic pop vein  surely inserted for musicvideo airplay the majority of tunes were recorded in the early 1960s I knew what music I wanted played behind every scene Ms Bergstein said I also had 60 pages of dance instructions The selections fall into three basic camps fairly tame Latin music for the Kellermans dance floor clean teen pop Frankie Vallis Big Girls Dont Cry for the Houseman cabin and sensual rock and soul Otis Reddings Love Man the Contours Do You Love Me for the staff quarters These last songs speak directly to Baby Houseman from the physical world I tried to choose the harshest music I could find the music that would be most sexually shocking to a young woman whod never heard it before Ms Bergstein said Because I imagine that in Babys bedroom at home thered be early Joan Baez the Weavers maybe Harry Belafonte What Baby Houseman begins to recognize is the same thing that many young Americans did when Bob Dylan switched from acoustic protest songs to amplified rockandroll in his famous appearance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival  the difference between music that is rebellious in content and music that is rebellious in form Dirty Dancing does end with romantic reconciliation and a highgloss dance number but to Ms Bergstein even these conventions carry with them some intentional ambiguity Something is over both at Kellermans and in the Houseman household but it is not yet clear what is going to replace it Within a few months of the time the movie ends Jake would be saying Nothings ever going to be the same  Ms Bergstein put it And in its way thats not so different than Bob Dylan singing The times they are achangin  VOX POP When Dirty Dancing wants to summon up the spirit of summers past it turns to one of the most familiar voices of New York radio Bruce Morrow better known as Cousin Brucie Besides contributing several voiceovers which he improvised with the films screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein Mr Morrow makes a brief appearance as a magician in photo below Dirty Dancing marks Mr Morrows screen debut and finding the right part took some doing Bonnie Timmerman the casting director first approached him about playing the social director of Kellermans the Catskills resort where the film is set But I didnt think I was exactly right for that Mr Morrow said because I always saw the social director as a portly kid shouting Everyone ready for Simon Says  So Ms Timmerman tried Mr Morrow  who is lean tall and middleaged  for small roles as a gynecologist a dentist and a carpenter before settling on that of the magician During the early 1960s when Dirty Dancing takes place Mr Morrow dominated the New York airwaves with his show on WABCAM After a hiatus from live radio he returned to WCBSFM several years ago and he broadcasts on Monday Wednesday and Saturday nights His autobiography Cousin My Life in Rock n Roll Radio is scheduled to be published in October by Beech Tree Books
"TELEVISION; TV DRAMAS: SWEET AGREEMENT, LITTLE GRIT",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/arts/television-tv-dramas-sweet-agreement-little-grit.html,TELEVISION AWARDS AS ANY dedicated viewer knows have become an elaborate and sleepinducing exercise in selfcongratulation If you want to know which comedy or drama series has won an Emmy these days you have to slog through a dense undergrowth of categories like hair styling for a drama series live and tape sound mixing or my favorite outstanding ingenue in a drama series before they get down to brass tacks To judge from the falling ratings of the Emmy Awards annual broadcast and its transfer to the fledgling Fox network this year viewers are becoming less willing to put up with all the ballast just for a glimpse of the stars they can see any day on Entertainment Tonight or Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous But television awards are more than just an opportunity for the Hollywood community to thank assorted colleagues and mothers Theyve become a major part of the industrys careful tailoring of its selfimage a way of signaling televisions solemn responsibility toward public issues as well as its devotion to creativity and artistic values For example this years Humanitas Prize an annual set of awards sponsored by a coalition of independent television broadcasters and the Los Angelesbased Human Family Institute went to shows about mental illness death by accident or chronic illness teenage sex and birth control The Humanitas Prize honors television writing that offers enriching human values or explores the meaning of human life criteria which in principle leave plenty of room for interpretation In practice though such selfcongratulatory awards tend to set up a pattern of approval that locks television programming into a woolly didacticism thats all heart and very little brain all sweet agreement and no challenge At its best television sets up a public argument about volatile matters that resonate deeply with viewers and even threaten to divide them At its worst the medium cranks out a pedestrian supply of toothless sermonizing on issues no one disagrees about It is this moral and political cowardice that gets disproportionately rewarded Within the limited terms of the television esthetic the Humanitas selection committee chose well this year Promise a betterthanaverage CBS drama starring James Woods as a hopelessly mercurial schizophrenic and James Garner as his brother and reluctant guardian lifted the TVmovie genre out of its formula of inspirational good cheer by refusing to offer easy solutions to the suffering of the mentally ill It tried neither to soften nor banish the pain with that old television remedy family togetherness If anything the films ending frankly acknowledged the limitations of family in coping with schizophrenia and thus extended an intelligent invitation to public discussion of responsibility for the care of the mentally ill Even so a major prize was once again going to a diseaseoftheweek movie another parable about troubles that cant be helped for which no blame can be assigned for which tears can be shed by all and then forgotten One wonders whether a TV movie that took a firm position about a highly divisive issue  say abortion rights  could ever win a major television award This years Humanitas Prize for a onehour show went to an episode of Family Ties in which the brash and confident Alex played by Michael J Fox was forced to deal with the accidental death of a close friend Now Im a reluctant admirer of Family Ties Reluctant because the show works so strenuously at paring down all meaningful social life to the unity of a nuclear family in the pinkest  or whitest  of affluent good health Admiring because its coziness is offset by a nimble waggish script Uncle Rob cant get divorced  hes a Republican that continually undercuts the shows premise and the slurpy goodness of the characters But I would have rewarded the show for its satirical edge not for the banal lesson in bereavement psychology served up in the prizewinning episode The same goes for Kate  Allie the CBS series that won in the halfhour category for an episode in which Allie counsels her teenage daughter to see a doctor about birth control before she has sex with her boyfriend The Human Family Institute which is headed by a Roman Catholic priest is to be applauded for rewarding a show that frankly advocates contraception But what sets Kate  Allie apart from the usual run of family comedies is not its earnest parenting tips nearly all sitcoms offer them but the innovative writing and acting that has these two spirited divorced women stumbling through each week cooking up ad hoc rules for living as women and as families To my mind the Humanitas Prize went to the right shows for the wrong reasons Its not that the issues they deal with are trivial And I have no quarrel with the networks desire to be responsible But about what Theres no risk in waxing responsible about issues whose tragic nature can hardly be disputed No one after all is for cancer or schizophrenia or addiction or death And while people might disagree about teenage sex andor contraception even those who like to believe that teenagers will do as theyre told when it comes to sexual abstinence would endorse Allies concern for her daughters well being What remains troubling is the way television awards encourage the mediums horror of genuine argument its flattening of debate into spurious consensus The networks pride themselves on their social conscience Yet its a castrated conscience that softens all problems into the aint it awful but its nobodys fault category safe tragedies that can be defined away as random blows dealt by God or fate I dont mean to trivialize cancer and mental disorder and other devastating diseases but their marketing appeals derive precisely from their arbitrariness Illness is a great social leveler it can strike anyone rich or poor black or white male or female old or young  anyone that is in the mass viewing audience that scheduling executives strive to carve out to please their advertising sponsors Illness mobilizes a diffuse reassuring sadness without anger it makes us weepy but rarely uncomfortable And in television our most relentlessly domestic narrative form both the root and the remedy for suffering lie within the family suggesting that social problems are private problems without public solutions Even the film industry traditionally less worried about public censure than television has taken to producing  and Oscarizing films that look suspiciously like TV movies such as Terms of Endearment and Ordinary People and more recently Hoosier For business reasons television producers argue that an unthreatening approach to social problems is the only way they can get a show on the air especially in these days of national consensus politics Yet televisions brief history has been punctuated with shows that risked dividing public opinion and alienating sponsors and survived From Ernie Kovacss nosetweaking food commercials to the domestic generational and racial wars of All in the Family to the moral ambiguities of Hill Street Blues television has albeit sporadically succeeded in fostering public debate and dissent without resorting to spurious resolutions In recent years the Emmy Awards have acknowledged a few of the more challenging shows This year for example Cagney  Lacey won in the dramatic series category with Hill Street Blues and Moonlighting close runnersup But there is in this glittering annual display of prosy paeans to quality television a certain hypocrisy since some of those same shows spend the rest of the year staving off the network ax ever poised above the heads of programs with wobbly ratings Inhouse award ceremonies hedge their bets by honoring both quality television and socalled feelgood television and since almost everyone gets an Emmy nomination these days the distinctions get lost in sheer numbers Its all very well for television to tell us over and over that were all brothers and sisters under the skin Its the social divisions outside the skin that need the public ventilation that television could be giving them but only occasionally does For as long as television producers and programmers continue to be rewarded for seeing their viewers solely as markets  and huge undifferentiated markets at that  they will continue to crank out human condition shows about problems we can all weep over and move on But viewers are not markets and people are capable of many levels of response to what they see On any given evening I for one may be watching with the leaden stare of the overachiever at the end of her day the freewheeling iconoclasm I adopt in the company of my peers or the careless inattention of one doing the ironing or talking on the phone I can weep about terminal disease and iron at the same time But I never iron when Im watching shows like The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd which meanders along with no discernible plot offering me and all the other viewers who catapulted the show into the top 10 a heady meditation full of twists and turns on the pleasures and terrors of fragmentary modern life A recent episode had Molly staggering through a 35th birthday saturated with disaster Her girlfriends love lives fell apart her former husband showered her with his usual unreliable charm and her whackedout family harassed her into a state of terminal exasperation But at the end alone in her apartment she found a simple delight in a mystery gift we never learned who sent it sat down at the piano and sang herself happily into tomorrrows uncertainties So if I were giving prizes for television writing that probes the meaning of life Id give them to shows like Molly Dodd that respect their viewers capacity for what Grace Paley once called the open destiny of life or to Saturday Night Lives Church Lady whose endless chatter Isnt that special launches a wicked assault on the meaningless psycholingo that saturates television talk shows and defuses conflict Id give them to shows that blow a whistling disrespectful wind through our tired familiarity with the repetitive orthodoxies of television and of life
CITIES SEEN AS KEY IN 4TH DISTRICT ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/nyregion/cities-seen-as-key-in-4th-district-election.html,FOR the past four weeks Christopher Shays and Christine M Niedermeier have spent each day barnstorming through lower Fairfield County in their short campaign to succeed the Congressman who represented the Fourth Congressional District for 17 years On Tuesday the sprint to win the seat held by Stewart B McKinney a Westport Republican who died of AIDS on May 7 at the age of 56 will end and as the candidates and their supporters await the returns of the special election at their campaign headquarters they will be paying particular attention to the districts two largest cities Bridgeport and Stamford Bridgeport is going to be very important said Sarah M Morehouse a professor of political science at the University of Connecticuts Stamford branch Stewart McKinney always managed to do well in Bridgeport If Chris Shays can do what McKinney did then Niedermeier is in trouble Just as important is Stamford where Democrats also outnumber Republicans although not as heavily as they do in Bridgeport I have to win Stamford big said the 41yearold Mr Shays a Republican who has represented the city in the State House of Representatives for the last 13 years If I dont win Stamford in a big way I really dont deserve to win the election The Fourth District  one of the countrys most affluent  takes in Bridgeport Darien Fairfield Greenwich New Canaan Norwalk Stamford Westport and part of Trumbull The campaign has attracted some degree of national attention because it is the countrys only Congressional race before the November 1988 election Locally however a low turnout is expected because of the offyear midsummer scheduling and a key question in determining the outcome of the election appears to be whether the many Republicans who are believed to be on vacation will vote or file absentee ballots to offset the traditionally low number of Democrats who go to the polls The Democratic candidate Ms Niedermeier a 35yearold lawyer and former state representative from Fairfield is perceived as a slight favorite by both Republicans and Democrats who have a 113000 to 97000 edge in the districts voter registration About 78000 voters in the district are unaffiliated She has raised twice as much money as her opponent As of July 29 she had raised 243000 compared with 130000 by Mr Shays She also plans to spend more money on advertising than the Republican and is more widely known beause of her unsuccessful campaign for the seat last year against Mr McKinney Our recognition is very high Ms Niedermeier said The candidates positions on various issues such as aid to the contras often are similar They both oppose it Mr Shays also depicts himself as an independent liberal Republican in the mold of Mr McKinney I dont vote the Republican way I dont vote the Democratic way he said last week at a debate in Stamford I vote for my constituency and let the chips fall where they may I never put much stock in labels Ms Niedermeier countered Im proud of my progressive stands on social issues and Chris Shays is running as a Reagan supporter even though his record belies that Perhaps the only major difference that has drawn attention between the candidates is abortion Both favor a womans right to have an abortion Mr Shays however is opposed to Federal funding for the procedure Ms Niedermeier also frequently points out that if elected she would be a member of the majority party and presumably would wield more influence There is a difference between us she said Its effectiveness Mr Shays was the surprise winner over three other candidates in the Republican primary last month  John T Becker 67 a Greenwich businessman Frank D Rich Jr 63 of Darien a Stamford developer and State Representative John G Metsopoulos 29 of Fairfield Earlier he narrowly received enough votes at the partys convention to qualify for the primary In the Democratic primary Ms Niedermeier easily defeated Michael G Morgan 40 a Stamford banker and State Senator Margaret E Morton 63 of Bridgeport who was seeking to become the first black member of Congress from Connecticut Mrs Morton provoked a minor controversy when shortly after losing the primary she threatened to endorse Mr Shays citing a lack of Democratic Party support for her campaign Later though she endorsed Ms Niedermeier She used the race to show her frustration with the Democratic Party in Bridgeport Ms Niedermeier said Perhaps the only gaffe in the race thus far was made by Ms Niedermeier two weeks ago when she reportedly uttered an offhand remark about AIDS at a debate in Darien and shortly afterward dismissed it as a joke to two reporters She later apologized to Mr McKinneys widow Lucie and said the remark  I wonder which one of us has it  was made because she didnot understand the question asked by the debate panelist Also in the race for the special election is Nicholas J Tarzia a Stamford plumber and follower of the political extremist Lyndon LaRouche who is running as the candidate of the War Against AIDS Party A Westport humorist Alan I Abel 62 the author of Dont Get Mad    Get Even has announced a bid as an independent writein candidate The winner will serve out the rest of Mr McKinneys term and would have to run for reelection in November 1988 The polls will be open Tuesday from noon to 8 PM
Medical Use of Fetal Tissues Spurs New Abortion Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/nyregion/medical-use-of-fetal-tissues-spurs-new-abortion-debate.html,The surge of interest in medical uses for tissue from aborted fetuses has opened a new debate about medical technology and the beginnings of life and added a new dimension to the longstanding controversy over abortion Evidence is increasing that the special properties of fetal tissue can contribute to the recent advances in the use of tissue transplants to treat Parkinsons disease and other nerve disorders Most medical researchers believe it is only a matter of time before fetal tissue is routinely used Indeed fetal tissue is already being distributed to a few researchers around the country And one company plans to market cells grown from fetal tissue Youre Asking for Body Parts For many people on both sides of the issue the most troubling possibility is that some women will conceive children with the intent of aborting them either to aid a family member or to sell them for their tissue Recently for example a California woman called a medical ethics expert to ask whether she could be artificially inseminated with sperm from her father who suffers from Alzheimers disease The woman wanted to abort the resulting fetus so that the brain tissue could be transplant into her fathers brain I told her first that it was technically not possible and second that it was ethically wrong said Arthur Caplan director of the University of Minnesota Center for Biomedical Ethics This is the ultimate issue of intergenerational justice Youre not just asking for the pocketbooks of the young  youre asking for body parts The doctors who work with fetal tissue are well aware of the intense moral issues involved All of us who work in fetal research feel that if someone has decided to have an abortion and gives permission it is all right to use that tissue to help someone else said Dr Robert Gale of the University of California at Los Angeles But despite our intellectual belief that this is right we understand why there is a controversy Dr Gale who traveled to the Soviet Union to treat victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident last year transplanted fetal liver cells which generate bone marrow into six of the victims They later died Heart of Abortion Debate The controversy over the use of fetal tissue goes to the heart of the abortion debate Antiabortion groups and some officials of the Roman Catholic Church fear that the new medical uses for fetal tissue may help to legitimize abortion And abortion rights groups worry that the demand for fetal tissue may complicate matters for women seeking abortions This is almost a variant on the Baby M thing a way women could make money through reproduction said Prof Nadine Taub of the Womens Rights Litigation Clinic at the Rutgers University Law School Scientists expect fetal tissue to be particularly valuable in implant treatments because it grows faster than adult tissue is more adaptable and causes less immunological rejection So far most of the research involves the use of fetal brain pancreas and liver tissue to treat Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease Huntingtons chorea spinal cord injuries diabetes leukemia aplastic anemia and radiation sickness But many more uses may be forthcoming the doctors and others say Fetal tissue is becoming more and more important to research said Lee Ducat president of the Philadelphiabased National Disease Research Institute which gathers human tissue including fetal tissue and distributes it to qualified researchers Its an issue people are going to have to wrestle with very soon she added Breakthrough in Mexico Ms Ducats group has been supplying fetal tissue to a handful of researchers in this country for several years without much fanfare When we gather fetal tissue which comes from elective abortions we get the informed consent of the mother she said What stirred the current interest in such implants was a medical breakthrough that did not involve fetal tissue Rather it was the news last year that surgeons in Mexico City were successfully treating victims of Parkinsons disease by implanting adrenal tissue into their brains The disease is characterized a loss of muscle control often accompanied by tremors and slurred speech While no one knows exactly how the procedure works it seems to stimulate production of dopamine the substance that Parkinsons victims lack The procedure gained more attention last month when Muhammad Ali the former boxing champion who suffers from a milder form of the disease discussed the treatment with the surgeon who pioneered the procedure Although the Mexican doctors  and surgeons in the United States now following their lead  are using tissue taken from the patients own adrenal glands most experts believe that fetal brain tissue would work even better Researchers in Sweden will start treating a few Parkinsons disease patients with fetal brain tissue transplants later this year and if their experiments are successful they will soon be duplicated in this country If the Swedes get dramatic results its going to force the issue said Dr Abraham N Lieberman of the New York University Medical Center which has begun treating Parkinsons disease patients with adrenal tissue The advantage is that fetal tissue is a better match for the missing brain cells than adrenal tissue The disadvantage is that it raises tremendous ethical and social issues Thousands of Requests Although doctors emphasize that the brain implant operation is new and untested many Parkinsons victims want the treatment Frank Williams national director of the American Parkinson Association says his group has received thousands of requests for the treatment using adrenal tissue The majority of people with the disease could care less about the ethical questions  they just want something that works Mr Williams said There is no consensus on the age at which a fetus would provide the best tissue for medical use For brain tissue implants some doctors say a nineweekold fetus is optimal while others say an older fetus is better Most fetal tissue comes from elective abortions performed in the first four months of pregnancy Then too human tissue becomes medically useless unless it is taken quickly after death but determining the exact moment of fetal death can be a problem Furthermore the abortion methods that are best for the health of the woman may not be the best ones for insuring the viability of the tissue There is a potential for abuse of women in this whole thing and that worries us said Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League which is still debating its position on the use of fetal tissue I think the questions about fetal tissue are going to complicate the discussion about abortion she said One of the things that makes this like surrogate mothers such a hard issue is that as a society we have no real public policy framework for deciding issues concerning reproductive rights Restrictions Recommended The laws governing organ donations require the consent of the donor or the donors next of kin In the case of fetuses most lawyers say tissue may be properly donated with the consent of the pregnant woman Many states also have laws restricting experiments on fetuses which may interfere with the new medical uses of fetal tissue After a conference sponsored by the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland a panel of doctors lawyers and ethicists recently endorsed the use of fetal tissue but recommended certain restrictions First the panel said the doctors involved in decisions regarding the abortion should not conduct the procedures using fetal tissue Second they advised anonymity should be maintained between donor and recipient and donors and recipients should not be related Almost everyone concerned with the use of fetal tissue agrees it is morally wrong although not illegal to become pregnant for the sole purpose of aborting a fetus to obtain tissue Theres a big difference between taking advantage of a death to harvest tissue and creating a life just to abort it said one neurosurgeon involved in Parkinsons surgery Indeed where an abortion is planned anyway some doctors lawyers and ethicists say that donating the fetal tissue may help to relieve some of the sadness surrounding the decision Donating tissue to help someone else can be helpful in the process of grieving or bereavement said Mr Caplan the University of Minnesota ethicist Roman Catholic Views The National RighttoLife Committee however says the idea is morally repulsive People who kill these tiny developing babies by virtue of the fact that they have done the killing lose any moral right to use those tissues said Dr John C Willke president of the committee He said the medical use of fetal tissue will offer an additional rationalization to some people who defend the killing The Catholic Church accepts the idea of some use of fetal tissue according to Richard Doerflinger director of the Office for ProLife Activities at the United States Catholic Conference Our concern would be that the fetal organ donor be treated with the same respect as any other organ donor he said We need to be morally certain that the donor is dead and standards for brain death in a fetus are not very clear Theres a danger of collusion with abortionists Even if the abortion and the transplant are kept separate Id worry that it will make women see abortion as something better because it supplies organs for treatments Commercial Aspects of Life Some supporters of the right of a woman to have an abortion however believe the new technologies will have the opposite effect because they may be seen as evidence that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception Many womens rights advocates are also worried that women would be financially coerced into undergoing a particular kind of abortion to produce the most usable kind of tissue Although weve banned the sale of human organs there are markets in renewable body tissues like blood bone marrow and sperm Mr Caplan said I think the commercialization or commodification  of the body is a bad idea in a society that has a hard time keeping the commercial aspects of life in check in other areas Professor Taub of Rutgers said Its a hard one whether fetuses should be treated as renewable body tissue that can be sold or as organs that cant be I dont think fetal tissue should be salable And it seems to me that if women cant make money off it companies shouldnt be able to make money off it either But at least one company may soon be doing so Hana Biologics a publicly traded company in Alameda Calif is using fetal tissue to grow neural and pancreas cells Nancy Peterson a spokesman for the company would say only that the tissue came from thirdparty nonprofit procuring agencies Hana expects to begin clinical trials with the pancreas cells later this year and if they go well to begin selling the cells in a few years The companys technology Ms Peterson says should allow it to take tissue from one fetus and use it to create enough cells to treat many people a prospect she said could prevent people from conceiving just for the purpose of getting fetal tissue
ABOUT MEN; A New Romance,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/magazine/about-men-a-new-romance.html,I FOUND NEW LOVE AFTER A DIVORCE and lived sheltered while the thunderheads of AIDS stacked up outside We broke up a year ago because I wanted babies and my partner younger and on a career roll wanted her kids eventually It was a wistful sensible parting ugly and standard Past 40 now I reentered the world of adult dating a prospect that alone should make scrapping couples cling to each other After a while I met someone nice We went out to the movies and suppers and talked We had fine times It felt the way the start of something feels But AIDS had changed the rules Things progressed according to an unfamiliar new normality We lurched toward each other reluctantly News reports told us that heterosexuals who dont shoot drugs arent yet all that likely to catch AIDS but nevertheless counseled celibacy caution or at the very least condoms We saw the gruesome plights of those already afflicted Friends were in danger now and the danger was headed our way Im a sensible man and regularly evade lowodds mortality I wear seat belts I dont walk in rough neighborhoods late We nuzzled It seemed ridiculous to pass up beguiling companionship with someone so manifestly robust Our forbearance felt crazy to me as if we had been seized not by prudence but prudery And yet we both felt compelled to follow the new rules If this was madness it was shared culturewide delusion Putting it frankly as we eventually did each suspected that the other just might have been polluted made deadly Condoms dont resolve that suspicion at all We would bring this doubt into bed with us Thinking that way makes it hard to fall in love This leeriness taxed an early liaison beyond its strength We were at an impasse and drifted apart I looked for a path around this dilemma Even without AIDS worries new intimacy is hard for grownups to come by Eventually I decided to get tested I would step away from the uncertainty that had confused that romance move to higher ground well in advance of the forecast deluge Had the probability of my carrying AIDS not been extremely low I might well have been more reluctant As it was I would buy assurance in return for a brief slight risk of bad news And if I did carry AIDS I decided I would indeed wish to know hard as that would be in order to avoid murdering a stillhypothetical someone I might love To test anonymously in Massachusetts especially if one admits to heterosexuality over the phone one must wait weeks for an appointment and weeks for results An old friend a doctor consented to do it bootleg like a preRoe v Wade abortion on his kitchen table I patted the dog The doctor drew blood into test tubes and labeled them with my secret number To my surprise the few days wait for test results was easy nothing new had happened I didnt even really feel brave It takes far more courage to socialize as if there were no AIDS than to get tested While waiting I read up on the latest AIDS statistics from the Centers for Disease Control They have persisted in reporting a low rate of heterosexual transmission month after month They report no fledgling epidemics among college students or yuppies Newspapers have reported that many heterosexual AIDS carriers are needle users lovers These numbers strongly suggest that I was responding more to public hullabaloo than to actual threat How likely was it that if I followed my usual patterns I would date a woman with AIDS The odds for me were amazingly long which of course they are not for everyone Up through the week I was tested in the whole nation only 100 white heterosexual women had ever had active AIDS Perhaps two were in Boston where I live Perhaps there were 60 undiagnosed carriers in the whole city and if they are pals with addicts they are probably not in my tame crowd And the latest studies seemed to show that even if I courted one of these rare carriers catching the disease would be unlikely I was surprised even chagrined to find the odds higher that Id get run over or choke on steak while dating in Boston than that Id catch AIDS Did I therefore forget the whole thing never ask for the test results go on a tear to make up for lost time I accepted these new statistics but I had also watched the news and read the paper The talk at dinner parties nearly always swerved toward AIDS Friends friends were dying Like millions of single heterosexual counterparts I had marinated in AIDS terror and this rational recalibration of odds was not enough to allay the fear that Id absorbed I phoned I heard the expected good news A few days later I called my friend  not to reopen our nonaffair but to put it in perspective She was surprised Id had the test She would never take a scary test like that She believed that at the right moment she would want to tumble into bed not plan the route She became pensive then said You know in one way AIDS is handy You can flirt knowing thats probably all that will happen Perhaps we had been like two dogs barking at each other across a fence Now the fence was gone We said goodbye I discovered purity I felt almost virginal the way a pious Roman Catholic might following a hearty act of contrition Id craftily abandoned my proper risk group Id dodged the awful carnage and exempted myself from the media barrage For the moment I was immune  at least to this form of communicable dread Here in Eden I have spied a few hygienic maidens wandering about likewise repurified Its very pleasant here We recognize one another like summer people on an island New folks arrive daily Once more compatibility is the main point although forthrightness counts more than ever Bachelorhood has become far more complicated than it was in the carefree 1970s when there was still unpremeditated romance Mystery which preceded love then now must follow it

What Privacy Case Says of Bork's Judgment,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/21/opinion/l-what-privacy-case-says-of-bork-s-judgment-658087.html,To the Editor I agree with William Safire that confirmation of Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court ought not to hinge on the abortion issue Upgrade the Court column Aug 12 Fairminded people from both parties believe that the American people would be ill served if the Senate forced Supreme Court candidates to take political litmus tests I agree again when Mr Safire says that Judge Bork possesses a remarkably independent judgment  but in such decisions as firing Archibald Cox at the height of the Watergate crisis or defending the legality of poll taxes at the height of urban unrest one might also describe his judgment as bad The point is has Judge Bork as Mr Safire suggests proved himself toughminded or has he simply proved himself again and again closedminded One need only turn to Judge Borks heated writings against a 1965 Supreme Court decision allowing married couples to use contraceptives in their own bedrooms for the answer Here was a case involving a man and a woman Estelle Griswold and Charles Lee Buxton chairman of the Yale School of Medicines department of obstetrics and gynecology who opened a birthcontrol clinic in New Haven in 1961 In so doing they defied a state law forcing Connecticut residents to travel across state lines to purchase contraceptives It was an act of civil disobedience and both were arrested 10 days later Their convictions were upheld by the State Appellate Court and the State Supreme Court of Errors before the case went to the Supreme Court Why had they done such a thing Dr Buxton and Ms Griswold like the Founding Fathers had been strongly influenced by the idea of bodily selfdetermination as a natural right which actually had its origins in the Puritan revolution in 17thcentury England And it was this idea of a property in ones own person that persuaded the Supreme Court to rule that married couples had the right to contraception  because they had a constitutional right to privacy in matters affecting their lives and bodies Judge Bork has called the Griswold decision improper and intellectually empty The Framers who spoke of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness would he maintains have assigned government the prerogative of patrolling the nations bedrooms Not many Americans would agree with that But then Judge Bork has his own fixed ideas about such things And since he believes that the court ought to be always open to rethink constitutional problems nothing would stop him from imposing those ideas on all Americans ALFRED F MORAN Executive Director Planned Parenthood of New York City New York Aug 12 1987

"FILM: 'DIRTY DANCING,' A CATSKILLS ROMANCE IN 1963",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/21/movies/film-dirty-dancing-a-catskills-romance-in-1963.html,IN their time almost all forms of popular American music and dancing from the foxtrot and the tango through rockandroll and all of its variations have scandalized the members of an older generation whose own sexuality had earlier been liberated by tamer means As music lyrics and dance steps have become more and more sexually explicit fathers and mothers from coast to coast have felt alienated and worried that pop music was leading their children straight to hell As it was with the bunny hug danced to a ragtime tune in 1910 so is it today when Madonna sings Papa Dont Preach This culture generation gap has produced its own Hollywood genre Most of these films have been quickies on the order of Dont Knock the Rock 1957 and Twist Around the Clock 1962 but there have occasionally been more ambitious if not much better films Herbert Rosss Footloose 1984 Though music is the subject of each film sex is the subtext In the final reel generations reconcile initially stuffy oldsters end up rocking rolling or twisting the night away showing the young that though creaky of joint and infirm of body they can still do it It is also the subject of Dirty Dancing which opens today at the National and other theaters Dirty Dancing is a nicely bittersweet genre movie set at Kellermans Mountain House a Grossingerslike Catskills resort hotel in the summer of 1963 President Kennedy was still alive Americas stake in Vietnam had not yet become divisive and socially conscious young people were going on freedom marches in the South and joining the Peace Corps The film is about Frances Houseman Jennifer Grey nicknamed Baby a pretty middleclass teenager who finds her adult identity in her first love affair  with Johnny Castle Patrick Swayze the hotels dance instructor For a girl of Babys conventionally liberal Jewish background shes planning to study third world economics in college Johnny a young man from the wrong side of the tracks exemplifies the freedom expressed through a new and as yet socially unacceptable form of dancing This dirty dancing a phrase used only in the films title features a lot of steamy body contact and pelvic thrusts which unleash emotions supposedly left withered by mambos and chachachas Taking a formula that is itself creaky of joint and infirm of body Eleanor Bergstein the writer and Emile Ardolino the director have made an engaging popmovie romance of somewhat more substance than one usually finds in summer movies designed for the young I suspect that ones responses to Dirty Dancing to its period details even to its state of mind will depend on the associations one brings into the theater What is undeniable however is a basic decency of feeling shaped in part by the films obligations to its optimistic genre Baby as written by Miss Bergstein and played by Miss Grey Ferris Buellers Day Off is no bubblebrained teenager but a bright inquisitive young woman whos on her way to being her own person Miss Bergstein is much better on creating character than in reimagining formula events Babys liberation comes through her forbidden association with the womanizing Johnny Castle after his partner Penny Cynthia Rhodes becomes pregnant and Baby agrees to substitute for her in a mambo demonstration at another hotel Theres a really quite awful subplot about Pennys abortion financed by money that Baby has borrowed from her conventionally liberal doctorfather and about the arrogant young Ivy League fellow who is responsible for Pennys condition Given the limitations of his role that of a poor but handsome sexobject abused by the rich women at Kellermans Mountain House Mr Swayze is also good Hes even convincing when he must admit in one of the films lesser moments that the reason people treat me like nothing is because I am nothing Hes at his best  as is the movie  when hes dancing The movie makes a lot of good use of period music to which some not very evocative new songs have been added The dancing itself especially the dirty dancing choreographed by Kenny Ortega looks very contemporary or at least as contemporary as Saturday Night Fever but it has a drive and a pulse that give the film real excitement Though the film takes place in 1963 just a year after the twist was all the rage the twist itself seems already to have come and gone at Kellermans Mountain House The womens clothes also look surprisingly mid80s and in 1963 would anybody have used the term wimp These anachronisms arent especially important except that Miss Bergstein has been so specific about the films period She seems to want Dirty Dancing to be seen as a fond goodbye to a comfortable liberal American way of life before the country was radicalized by the assassination of President Kennedy and by the increasingly bitter antiVietnam War movement Thats loading a small movie with rather more than it can carry without a lot of highly detailed program notes Dirty Dancing works best when its most direct and unpretentious It has the kind of sweet simplicity that somehow always eludes John Hughes Sixteen Candles Pretty in Pink Ferris Buellers Day Off Mr Ardolino whose background is in theater and in television dance films doesnt clutter the film with extraneous sentimental detail nor even with too much colorful and familiar detail about life in your usual Catskill resort hotel He also obtains excellent performances from his cast which in addition to Miss Grey Mr Swayze and Miss Rhodes includes Jerry Orbach as Babys father Jack Weston as the owner of Kellermans and Lonny Price who is especially funny as Mr Westons arrogant wimpish grandson Dirty Dancing which has been rated PG13 Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13 includes some vulgar language and a lot of dancing that is comparatively erotic Watch Your Step DIRTY

'His Eminence and Hizzoner' to Write a Book,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/nyregion/his-eminence-and-hizzoner-to-write-a-book.html,Mayor Koch and John Cardinal OConnor who were recently described by a mutual friend as the temporal and ecclesiastical Odd Couple are collaborating on a book to be entitled His Eminence and Hizzoner Each will argue his position on abortion child care homosexual rights and other issues on which church and state meet  sometimes head on Despite differences on those issues the Jewish mayor and the Roman Catholic prelate have forged a friendship that associates say is warm deep and based on mutual respect The Cardinal himself described their relationship as peculiar and maybe unique in the United States During a recent 30minute joint interview studded with ribbing and ripostes they said they would each write separate chapters on the same subjects No KissyHuggy Book The Cardinal emphasized that they would write the book themselves because Were both too vain to let anybody else write it And the Mayor said the Cardinals name would appear first because Church always comes before state Mr Koch said the book would tell it as it is but is not gonna be a kissyhuggy book His coauthor wincing exaggeratedly quipped I can see the headline now on this story No kissyhuggy book  They have ruled out using a literary agent to negotiate on their behalf Like Mother Teresa the Mayor explained were going to depend on God to provide But with three published books between them they are not unaware of the potential value of their partnership My thought would be if somebody wants to come in and give us a 100000 advance well take it the Mayor said Otherwise well put the book up for auction after we have a sufficient number of chapters that people can see Royalties to Be Shared The two men consider a signed agreement unnecessary They will split the royalties from the book onehalf will go to Catholic charities the other to the City of New York Mayor Koch said he would like the citys share divided between the Meals on Wheels program and maintaining the citys archives Hoping to enrich both programs he added I expect every Catholic and every Jew in America to buy this book The Mayor who suffered a minor stroke recently said he had already started writing his part of the book and that cerebral activity has no impact at all on my medical condition Despite their repartee the coauthors made it clear that their purpose in exploring issues of church and state in the book was one they took seriously My primary interest the Cardinal said is in attempting to assess from a moral spiritual and religious perspective those public policy issues of critical concern to all people An Unusual Friendship While the two men probably agree more often than not their disagreements have sometimes pitted the city and the archdiocese against one another in the press and even in the courts The most widely publicized dispute involved a mayoral directive Executive Order 50  since voided by the courts  that prohibited discrimination against homosexuals by organizations doing business with the city The unusual friendship began sources say at the thenArchbishop OConnors installation as head of the New York Archdiocese in the spring of 1984 five months after the death of Terence Cardinal Cooke How am I doing the Archbishop asked turning Mr Kochs signature expression back on him Ive always wanted to meet you Mr Mayor he said when they shook hands afterward The friendship so flourished that when Archbishop OConnor was elevated to Cardinal at a ceremony in Rome in May 1985 he invited the Mayor Only in New York he said at a dinner at the time can two people who sue one another be such good friends Mutual Honesty In the recent interview Cardinal OConnor described their relationship as one of complete honesty The Mayor has never made an effort to force me to bend morally he said Hes not attempted to use me for his political interests and I have no intention of losing my friendship with the Mayor to advance the interests of the church Mr Koch likewise described that relationship as personal and professional I enjoy the Cardinals company he said and the dinners that we have are very very stimulating The Mayor has entertained the Cardinal at a Chinese restaurant the Cardinal has entertained the Mayor at an Italian restaurant and mutual friends have taken both of them to a steakhouse But in recent times the two have dined informally about every four to six weeks at either Gracie Mansion or the Cardinals residence An aide to Cardinal OConnor described the dinners as intellectual round tables filled with laughter and joking It was during dinner at the rectory that the Cardinal proposed the collaboration I was flabbergasted honored really Mr Koch recalled The Mayor said that because they both were fast and frequent writers not given to writers block the book should be ready for publication in about a year Were not looking for something Shakespearean Cardinal OConnor said Milton will do

REAGAN'S ADVISERS SEE SHIFT IN FOCUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/us/reagan-s-advisers-see-shift-in-focus.html,President Reagans influence on Capitol Hill has declined so markedly that his senior advisers have concluded he will be forced to focus his attention this fall on goals that do not require legislation Mr Reagans ability to shape the legislative agenda in the months ahead has been reduced because of such factors as Democratic control of both houses of Congress and the political damage inflicted by the Irancontra affair these officials have concluded One thing that came out of the Irancontra hearings was a very realistic analysis of what it means to deal with a Democratic Congress said one senior aide Its going to be very difficult more difficult than we anticipated And with the election coming up that will make it even tougher I dont think anyone looks for huge legislative victories Strategy Talks Held Meeting here this week in a private strategy session the Presidents top advisers concluded that what Mr Reagan calls his economic bill of rights is now dead as a legislative proposal They also decided that the White House would be better off avoiding vetoes and reaching a compromise with Congress on several important domestic bills such as those on trade welfare and insurance for catastrophic illness Among the dozen participants in the meeting were Howard H Baker Jr the chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein Mr Bakers deputy Tom Griscom communications director and Frank C Carlucci national security adviser Another approach the White House has already put into effect is using regulations and executive orders to achieve policies that might face Congressional opposition The Administration for instance recently announced new guidelines making it more difficult for family planning clinics to advise clients about abortion if the clinics receive Federal funds In his weekly radio address today Mr Reagan announced the formation of a group to be named the United States Taxpayers Commission that will seek to focus public attention on reducing the cost of government rather than raising taxes The panel does not require Congressional approval Given this political climate Mr Reagans advisers say he will concentrate on areas in which the Presidents inherent constitutional powers give him a special degree of authority to the day he leaves office The main area is foreign affairs and the President places great emphasis on reaching an agreement on arms control with the Soviet Union before the end of the year His agenda will also be crowded with such pressing problems as a peace initiative in Central America and threats to free navigation in the Persian Gulf Major Drive for Bork Moreover his aides say Mr Reagan is planning to make a maximum effort to win Senate confirmation for Judge Robert H Bork his nominee for the Supreme Court One senior adviser summed up the Presidents priorities by saying Arms reduction is No 1 but Bork is No 2 Many of these goals would require some form of Congressional action An arms treaty would eventually have to be approved by the Senate and Judge Bork must be approved by the same body But in these cases Mr Reagan enjoys an extra advantage The Constitution gives the President the right to negotiate treaties and pick Supreme Court nominees and Congress is more reluctant to overturn those decisions than it is to reject normal legislative proposals The biggest areas where we can shape policy are those that are devoid of politics said one senior official Another added that the Administration was concentrating on issues that involve executive leadership that grant a high degree of control to the President Policy Options Prepared The meeting here was intended to review the fall schedule and start preparing policy options on specific issues Those options will then be presented to the President after he returns to Washington on Sept 6 As they sat around in shorts and sport shirts discussing the state of the Reagan Presidency Mr Reagans aides expressed a deep sense of relief that the hearings on the Iran arms deals and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels had finally ended Some people didnt think the President would get through the hearings and he did one official observed But the aides acknowledge that the price was high The President as one put it clearly took some very serious body blows and emerged with his credibility and his charisma badly tarnished He is no longer seen as the awesome figure he appeared to be before the Irancontra affair said one senior adviser Impact Was Miscalculated Another aide said that the White House had miscalculated the impact the hearings could have on the general public and that the months of televised testimony became more of a factor than we assumed they might The Irancontra affair was particularly troublesome the aides concluded because it came on top of the Democrats return to power in the Senate One result has been an exceptionally realistic assessment within the White House of what the Administration can hope to accomplish on Capitol Hill Earlier this summer Mr Reagan frequently talked about using his veto to block Democratic initiatives and the veto threat remains a powerful weapon But now many of his aides think the President would be better advised to seek accommodation on at least some of the legislative measures now moving toward passage on Capitol Hill Health Insurance Backed Were developing a strategy of dealing with Congress that involves both conciliation and a judicial use of confrontation said one senior aide Richard Wirthlin the Presidents pollster presented survey results here showing that many Americans favor legislation that would insure them against the cost of catastrophic illness The White House still worries that a bill on such insurance now being drafted by Congress would be too expensive but it now seems more eager to find a compromise Similarly senior officials say they are negotiating with key Democrats on the welfare issue in the hope that a bill emerges that we can sign However White House aides hold out no hope for the economic bill of rights which includes such favorite Reagan proposals as a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget Even though the President will continue to talk about the issue it was barely mentioned in the planning session this week Minor Role in Budget Fight In addition White House aides say the President will probably play only a minor role in the budget battles this fall In his televised speech last week the President offered to negotiate with Congress on all spending items including the military if Congressional leaders allowed vote on the single issue of a budgetbalancing amendment But senior officials acknowledge that the offer had little meaning for two reasons such a vote is not likely and the President remains adamantly opposed to any budget compromise that includes tax increases In private some of the Presidents aides express surprise and frustration that he remains so opposed to a tax increase but they detect not one iota of flexibility as one put it Accordingly the aide added the issue of whether to raise taxes or reduce spending cant be fully resolved in the time remaining before the 1988 elections The issue on which the President retains the most authority is negotiating with the Soviet Union and White House aides remain hopeful that an arms agreement can be concluded soon enough for it to be signed at a summit meeting this year Possible Contra Aid Request The Persian Gulf will be a major topic when the President addresses the United Nations next month White House aides point out that while Congress has criticized Mr Reagans policy of placing Kuwaiti tankers under American protection the lawmakers have failed to block the policy and it has gone into effect Mr Reagan has also taken the lead in Central America by presenting a joint peace plan with Representative Jim Wright the Speaker of the House Should that plan fail the President would almost certainly ask Congress to provide increased military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels after Sept 30 If the President does request more aid he can argue that he remains the steward of the nations foreign policy But the outcome would still be very close In recent weeks Mr Reagan has been placing great emphasis on the nomination of Judge Bork and he is planning a meeting with supporters of his choice in Los Angeles next week A Personal Priority The President has long discussed the importance of the Supreme Court in shaping the nations political life and as one aide put it the stress on the nomination reflects more than anything else the Presidents personal priorities  this is something he cares a lot about In addition the Bork nomination might well be the Presidents last chance to tip the balance of the Supreme Court toward the right and his aides are concerned that if the judge is defeated they will not have enough time before the end of Mr Reagans term to win confirmation of a replacement Finally the President and his staff see the Bork nomination as a test of their strength and determination A loss they worry could further erode their influence in Mr Reagans final 17 months in office As one aide put it Its one you dont want to lose
WHEN THE ROT SET IN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/books/when-the-rot-set-in.html,THE MANUFACTURE OF EVIL Ethics Evolution and the Industrial System By Lionel Tiger 345 pp New York A Cornelia  Michael Bessie Book Harper  Row 2050 EVENTS have conspired to lend The Manufacture of Evil a timeliness Lionel Tiger could not possibly have anticipated when he began writing True he must have had in mind notable malefactions like Watergate but how could he have guessed that before the book appeared White House aides would admit to having deliberately circumvented the law in their zeal to carry out the Presidents clandestine foreign policy Or that a leading candidate for the Presidency would withdraw after seeming to defy the received code of marital fidelity Or that reputable investment bankers would confess to having used secret insider information to make killings on Wall Street Or that prominent medical researchers would be shown to have falsified vital scientific evidence Or that several topnotch athletes would admit using drugs Or that two revered television evangelists would in effect plead guilty to charges of gross venality and sexual misconduct This conjunction of public scandals has provided a warranty of relevance for The Manufacture of Evil an earnest work of popular anthropology that purports to explain why citizens of modern industrial societies find it especially difficult    to sustain clear notions of what is right and wrong Mr Tiger who identifies himself as a professor of anthropology trained as a political sociologist and lured by biology approaches his subject from the distanced vantage of an evolutionary social biologist He attributes our seemingly chronic state of ethical confusion and corruption to a kind of maladaptation a devastating mismatch between the imperatives of our vast complex impersonal radically innovative industrial system and our species inherent moral sense His major premise is that humankind is endowed with a natural perhaps even genetically transmitted morality During the roughly four million years when our ancestors lived in small bands of hunters and gatherers this smart primate like all other creatures behaved differently toward kin and nonkin Our inbred touchstone of right and wrong formed during those eons that constitute all but a minuscule fraction of human history was  and in large measure still is loyalty to other members of ones own community Such communities rarely comprised more than 200 or 300 people of whom many if not most were blood relatives But then some 10000 years ago with the invention of animal husbandry settled agriculture and cities the rot set in As society became larger and more intricately organized this natural morality based on kinship began to lose its efficacy The erosive process was gradual until the emergence of industrial society In a disconcertingly slapdash sketch of modern history Mr Tiger focuses on the jump into modernity that humankind allegedly took some three centuries ago He regards the industrial system with its powerful sciencebased technologies and its wellnigh limitless productive capacities as a virtual mutation  a quite literal break in the continuity of human history Compared with the way this highly gregarious mammal had been living for several million years Mr Tiger argues its urban industrial way of life hardly could be more exotic His aim in the first more successful half of the book is to draw a picture of a creature man living in a kind of new zoo illadapted to his basic behavioral nature Of this new zoos many exotic unsuitable features the most telling for Mr Tigers argument is the ideology of possessive individualism According to this bourgeois doctrine we each own ourselves in effect then the human essence no longer resides in being part of a family or other social whole but in the freedom of the self from dependence on the wills of others This ethic which facilitated the breakup of the natural gregarious group into atomistic units was ideally suited to the operation of a largescale market economy Cut loose from communal and blood ties individuals could easily be enlisted in the service of immense highly rationalized virtually selfgenerating bureaucratic institutions such as the industrial corporations To exemplify the new morality or amorality adopted by these deracinated monads Mr Tiger looks at scientific management Its characteristic principles of instrumental rationality provided emotional permission for people to focus on the trade or the task    rather than on the kin or other local group This singleminded commitment to the practical in turn made plausible that stock 20thcentury rationale for committing high crimes We were just doing our job This communal Eichmann defense indicates what happened to moral behavior when a natural animal produced an unnatural system By now the system has gained autonomy over everyones individual perceptions and decisions and industrial societies routinely yield vast outcomes that no one wants Hence the gloomy import of Mr Tigers title we have created a kind of society that necessarily if undesignedly manufactures evil At first sight there is something intuitively plausible even compelling about this updated version of what Mr Tiger admits is a familiar pattern It would be surprising indeed if the skyrocketing acceleration in the rate of social change since 1700 had not resulted in serious kinds of moral dislocation On reflection however Mr Tigers thesis provokes many questions Is the contemporary version of the conflict between public and private between the values fostered by largescale and smallscale social organizations all that unique Is that conflict qualitatively different in our time from what it was for people who lived under ancient tyrannies or the Roman Empire or the feudal or colonial systems And how do we reconcile Mr Tigers argument with the emergence of such powerful new codes of public morality as representative democracy socialism or communism Are the kinds of collective political behavior they recommend unnatural too Precisely what does it mean anyway to say that the industrial system or any other social arrangement contrived by human beings is unnatural Unfortunately Mr Tiger does not satisfactorily address any of these questions In the second half of the book he applies his thesis  and I do mean applies  to a number of recent trends in our society the emergence of the psychological sciences and their complicity in creating an oppressively manipulative psychoindustrial complex the rise and decline of mass literacy seen as another unnatural tool of industrialization the tightening grip of mass ideologies which are surrogates for disappearing beliefs and affiliations based on kinship the interplay between rising productivity and declining reproductivity which has been accompanied by the recruitment of women into the work force the industrialization of the body as it is affected by new kinds of contraception abortion and new reproductive technologies the womens and gay movements both charged with being legatees of Victorianism because they would deny the coercive role of nature in sexual behavior All of this amounts to a sustained attack on the heartless impersonal character of the industrial system and its sorry ethic of instrumental rationality MR TIGERS survey of our tribulations is such a stir of opinion clever phrasemaking anecdote arresting statistics and cameo analyses some provocative and enlightening others vague careless or incoherent that it finally becomes impossible to take it seriously He thus undermines the strong argument he had mounted in the first half of the book But perhaps the most damaging source of incoherence is Mr Tigers uncritical reliance upon the idea of nature or the natural as a measure of value Much of the book is written as if Mr Tiger could afford to ignore the heavy burden of metaphysical assumption that accompanies the concept of nature as a norm for judging human behavior and its oftendemonstrated affinities with obscurantist reactionary policies He is most vulnerable when he explicitly disavows all political approaches to the problems of the industrial era One would suppose that problems generated by a system of power are unavoidably political But Mr Tiger disagrees At points he describes the book as a secular theodicy  a vindication of divine justice in the face of existing evil  and he resorts throughout to theological analogies for his chief categories Eden for the ideal small community and its natural morality the fall for the rise of the industrial system evil for the unforeseen consequences of social action If read as a theodicy the controlling logic of The Manufacture of Evil becomes evident The parlous state of contemporary life may then be seen as a kind of divine punishment it is the price exacted from us for our fall into modernity  for our abandonment of the morality rooted in our inescapable biological condition The books final message therefore is an expression of a quasireligious rather than political view of life It is an exhortation to us to relearn respect for the limits ordained by godlike nature FRAIL THROUGH THE CENTURIES In the fourth century BC armorers serving the dictator Dionysius of Syracuse in Sicily invented the catapult    It could throw missiles over fortified walls into towns it could break down those walls it could kill people at distances of hundreds of yards with    devastatingly heavy objects    By comparison with the catapult a crude and definite danger contemporary warfare has become staggeringly complex and yet also mysteriously theoretical To the outsider the sophistication of modern weaponry is so elaborately linked to the precise exploitation of physical principles that the complexities of warfare may appear to be analogues of some inner complexity of the natural world itself    The fiery reality is that the technical brilliance military capacity and economic cost of weapons    increasingly dominate the technological forces of rich and needy societies alike But the physical frailty of people and the vulnerability of the human social world are the same as they have always been    What so nutritiously feeds this vast and encompassing process is the technological system itself The servant system has become the master builder It is all the more prepossessing because it remains theoretically subservient to the lords of politics From

U.S. Is Exporting Antiabortion Ideology,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/24/opinion/l-us-is-exporting-antiabortion-ideology-471287.html,To the Editor The Aug 1 letter from Thomas Blank assistant administrator of the bureau of external affairs in the Agency for International Development offers incomplete and misleading information to the public about the Governments spending for international family planning programs Although Mr Blanks letter proclaims the Reagan Administrations support for international family planning programs and boasts that funding for such programs increased from 190 million in 1981 to 237 million this year he neglects to state that in 1981 the Administration unsuccessfully attempted to strip all international family planning funds from the fiscal 1982 budget Furthermore in 1985 it was Congress rejecting the Reagan Administrations budget request that actually appropriated 290 million for international family planning Thus this years funding of 237 million represents a real decrease from the 1985 funding level Worse the Administration has proposed a further reduction to 226 million for fiscal year 1988 Moreover the Reagan Administration defunded the International Planned Parenthood Federation not because Planned Parenthood was misusing American assistance but because the Administration disagreed philosophically with the worlds largest voluntary family planning organization The Reagan Administration has not been able to impose its antiabortion philosophy on the United States Congress the courts or the American public Instead it has resorted to exporting ethics by edict Rather than making certain that women have factual information about all their reproductive options the Administration has decided that it knows what is best for them Americans may have to live with their electoral choice for the next year and a half but do foreigners have to die for it FAYE WATTLETON President Planned Parenthood New York Aug 5 1987

Pursuit of Women's Vote Taking a New Tack,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/24/us/pursuit-of-women-s-vote-taking-a-new-tack.html,Representative Richard A Gephardts greeting to the National Womens Political Caucus was genderneutral a carefully calibrated gesture of respect Im very pleased to be here today with experienced capable successful seasoned politicians the Missouri Democrat said Then he launched into his standard campaign speech only slightly altered for this particular audience It was a preview of how the candidates will pursue the womens vote in the race for the 1988 Democratic nomination and it looked very different from the script of four years ago In July 1983 the Democratic hopefuls who attended the caucuss convention in San Antonio took pains to embrace the feminist cause and its agenda Walter F Mondale opened his address by declaring I am a feminist Senator Ernest Hollings apologized for a brochure that called him the thinking mans candidate Less Talk of Womens Issues Ann F Lewis chairman of the caucuss Democratic task force recalled it as a time of careful language and some wariness even though the Democratic hopefuls lobbied hard for the backing of the bipartisan feminist group It was a little bit like a freshman mixer she said We were all dressed up but we were a little nervous about meeting each other This year what was striking about the speeches of most of the Democratic hopefuls was how little they were tailored to a narowly defined set of womens issues Some women here viewed that with concern particulary the scant mention of legalized abortion One woman for example rose to speak on behalf of Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado and declared Shes the only candidate who will talk to us and use the word we havent heard in three days Pat Schroeder supports choice But others here interpreted the broader appeals as a sign of respect The strategy was that youre addressing a group of serious political professionals said Joanne Symons a longtime feminist and one of Mr Gephardts advisors You show your stuff and address the major issues of the campaign So Mr Gephardt spoke much more about the decline of democratic values in the country than he did about legislation specifically relating to women And Senator Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois talked much more about the arms race than he did about the proposed equal rights amendment Gore Stumbles Over Names Senator Albert Gore Jr Democrat of Tennessee devoted more attention to overtly feminist appeals in his address than most of the candidates citing among other things the number of women on his senior campaign staff But he ended up chagrined at a news conference when asked to name some of those women saying he would have to furnish a list later There were sound political reasons for Mr Gephardt and the others to address the women as Democrats and politicians as well as feminists Perhaps the central challenge confronting Democrats in their nominating process is how to seek the support of the partys constituent groups such as feminists without appearing to pander to one group after another There are two poles to this that are both wrong said William Carrick Mr Gephardts campaign manager One is to come in here with a grab bag of promises that are cynically delivered and cynically received and the other is to bash Democratic constituencies that have been the most loyal While Mrs Schroeders potential candidacy was enthusiastically applauded many of the women here were quietly prosletyzing for other candidates They seemed to be comfortably juggling the roles of feminist and politician For example Lieut Gov Jo Ann Zimmerman of Iowa helped to put on a reception for the campaign of Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware yet praised the idea of a Schroeder candidacy Itll keep my candidate and everybody else up on the womens issues the Lieutenant Governor said Frustrating Being a Republican Among the Republican women at the caucus much of the talk was about their partys 1988 platform and their hopes of restoring the partys support for the equal rights amendment Our memories are longer than seven years said Gayle Melich a Republican leader in the caucus Were used to holding on Arlene Sontag another Republican leader in the caucus said Look its always frustrating being a Republican feminist lets face it Most of the threeday convention which ended today was devoted to the business of getting elected from polling technology to media strategy One of the more emotional moments in the program came Friday when the curtains parted in the convention hall and dozens of women appeared all of them elected or appointed officials each of them individually introduced to cheers and applause Shirley Chisholm one of the groups founders in 1971 told its members proudly We think we did bequeath to you some kind of legacy And Liz Carpenter a writer who is a former press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson told the group Saturday night that she was struck by the difference 16 years can make As I look out here all I can think of is how clean you all look she told a group that included state legislators local officials and a range of other officeholders We were so scruffy
Birth Control Ad: The Fight for TV Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/24/style/birth-control-ad-the-fight-for-tv-time.html,The television advertisement says Four out of five young women who dont use birth control get pregnant before they want to Birth control  from saying no to taking the pill Youre too smart not to use it The 30second message is the introduction to a fiveyear campaign by the New York State Family Planning Media Consortium to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions The consortium comprises 18 agencies and institutions including six branches of Planned Parenthood the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists several hospitals and health centers and government agencies The group is spending 700000 mostly in state funds for television and radio advertisements as well as posters Stations Refuse to Broadcast Ads There had been plans to broadcast the advertisement for eight weeks this summer in New York City and Buffalo and throughout the state next year But all six commercial stations in New York City turned it down It is being shown by two commercial stations in Buffalo The effort to have the commercial broadcast in the metropolitan area has once more reinforced the battle lines in a persistent controversy Is the use of television to promote birth control in the public interest or does it intrude upon religious and moral values But this time the debate has acquired some new twists Publicservice announcements concerning birth control have in fact been seen from time to time on television in New York State since a message by Planned Parenthood of New York City was broadcast in 1969 But the consortium is seeking to buy time rather than receive it free from the stations so it can choose when its commercial will be seen Stations tend to schedule publicservice announcements for late at night or other times when there are fewer people watching In addition since July paid commercials promoting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been shown on stations here The AIDS messages which are sponsored by the New York City Department of Health are broadcast on Channels 2 4 and 9 They are not shown on Channels 5 7 or 11 Asked why they had ignored longstanding policies by deciding to show ads about AIDS station executives said they had been influenced by the swift spread of the fatal disease Roger Colloff the vice president and general manager of WCBSTV said These policies are all balancing acts none of them are easy to arrive at The feeling of the company was that the overwhelming nature of the AIDS epidemic especially in metropolitan areas like New York necessitated that we do what we can to prevent the spread of the disease Regarding the birth control ad he said CBS has had a policy in place for some time that we dont accept advertising of this nature The reasoning This is an issue involving intimate personal behavior the sort of subject matter that some portion of our audience would consider intrusive into their moral or religious beliefs It was not deemed suitable for mass audience advertising He added however that the stations policy was undergoing review At WNBCTV Bud Carey the vice president and general manager said the decision to broadcast the AIDS messages was similarly based on the need to take action He added We also pointedly stated that any commercial for any device that may also provide contraceptive qualities such as the condom must have as its basic appeal the prevention of AIDS But the AIDS messages do not open the door for birth control ads in the view of Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Certainly showing the spots about AIDS demonstrates a step forward in terms of a terrible public health problem she said but no progess whatever in the terrible health problem of unintended pregnancy We do not see the two issues as interchangeable The consortiums advertisement is aimed at women 18 to 25 years old who experience the largest number of abortions in the state of New York according to Alfred F Moran executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City a member of the consortium He said that barring the commercial from television constituted censorship By blacking us out on all the major New York City television stations they have created their own kind of censorship he said Targeting the Women at Risk The issue here is the public interest Mr Moran continued In this country we have six million pregnancies a year and it is estimated that half of them are unintended Half of those  or 16 million  end in abortion The stations are withholding information from people at risk and failing to provide them with information that would help them avoid being dependent on abortion There were 148610 abortions performed in New York State in 1985 the last year for which data are available Only Washington and California have higher abortion rates Executives from all the television stations said they had dealt with birth control unwanted pregnancy and related subjects in news programs forums documentaries madefortelevision movies and series as well as in publicservice spots But Mr Moran contends that nothing has the same impact as paid advertisements We are talking about conveying a sustained message to young women he said You need to buy time to get both primetime exposure and consistency of exposure day after day as you do for soap or automobiles so that the message registers Discussions on news programs and publicservice announcements which are usually seen at 3 AM are very episodic According to George Dessart vice president for program practices at the CBS Broadcast Group messages that may be considered acceptable in the context of news or entertainment may not be in advertisements Commercials both paid ones and public service exhort as compared to programming which is intended to be instructive informative or entertaining he said When you are discussing a kind of behavior that touches on deeply personal matters there is a difference between exhortation and informing people of the consequences of behavior Mr Moran said the option of just saying no as a birth control method was included in the consortiums ad to say that people make their own choices and that abstinence is a legitimate choice But neither that approach nor the fact that the word contraception was not mentioned was able to sway television decision makers Precautions Do Not Allay Concern Even though it includes the phrase about saying no it is still a paid commercial promoting the use of birth control and it is our judgment that it is still a controversial issue said a WABCTV executive who requested that her name not be used We prefer not to deal with such issues in short snippets of 30 seconds she said If you take a topic to people with opposing points of view and cover both sides of the issue you are in control If you allow paid advertisements you are giving the loudest voice to the people with the most money Clearly there will be more dissension before the issue is resolved In the meantime birth control ads are being shown in other parts of the country including Buffalo where the consortiums commercial has been running on WIVB the CBS affiliate and WKBW the ABC affiliate Noting that Buffalo was a predominantly Roman Catholic area with generally conservative attitudes Leslie G Arries Jr president and chief executive officer of WIVB said There has been substantial reaction both pro and con I have responded to everybody who has

Reagan Names Adoption Group,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/us/reagan-names-adoption-group.html,President Reagan after moving to stop the use of Federal money for abortion counseling services named a Federal task force today to encourage adoption as an alternative for pregnant women We must expand and broaden our efforts to make sure that Americas familyless children are adopted Mr Reagan said in a statement We must do all we can to remove obstacles that prevent qualified adoptive parents from accepting these children into their home Mr Reagan has an adopted son Michael now 41 years old Part of Overall Effort But Marlin Fitzwater a White House spokesman who described the work of the task force here acknowledged that the proadoption initiative was also a part of Mr Reagans antiabortion campaign It is true that adoption is an alternative to abortion Mr Fitzwater said We want to make sure that there arent Federal rules and regulations that hinder that process The spokesman added I think its fair to say its part of the familyvalues initiative that the President alluded to earlier this month in an appearance before righttolife activists Then Mr Reagan pledged to support prolife causes He also announced several regulations proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services which would deny the use of Federal tax money for abortion counseling and referral services by about 4500 familyplanning centers Barriers to Adoption Mr Fitzwater said today that Americas adoption process cries out for some kinds of solution in a number of areas Each year more than 140000 children are adopted according to a fact sheet from the White House Press Office but thousands of childless families are still waiting for children to adopt Mr Fitzwater said that the 13member task force would include officials from various Federal agencies and departments and would focus on barriers to adoption Its activities will include studying whether Federal legislation is needed to ease the adoption process and determining if any state or local actions could speed the process Mary Gall a counselor to Constance Horner the director of the Office of Personnel Management will serve as chairwoman of the group Other members include Richard B Abell an Assistant Attorney General Gary L Bauer a domestic adviser to Mr Reagan Stephen J Entin Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary and Dodie Truman Livingston a commissioner in the Department of Health and Human Services
Decline in Abortions Reported,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/us/decline-in-abortions-reported.html,Federal health officials have reported a decrease in the number of abortions in the United States for the first time since recordkeeping began in 1969 A report released by the Federal Centers for Disease Control here says that 1268987 legal abortions were performed in the United States in 1983 the latest year for which figures are available That was down 27 percent from the 1303980 abortions reported in 1982 No conclusions were drawn from the decrease but the CDC suggested several possible reasons Cant Conclude Anything Were now working on analysis said Dr Hani Atrash a CDC reproductive health specialist We cant conclude anything on the basis of just the numbers we had The study was based on data received from all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the agency noted that the number of legal abortions reported to Federal authorities was probably lower than the number actually performed In 1982 the Alan Guttmacher Institute the New Yorkbased affiliate of Planned Parenthood of America reported 17 percent more abortions than did the CDC Dr Atrash said that one possible reason for the CDCs report of lower abortions was that the demand for abortions may simply have peaked A higher number of women have been sterilized over the years and they dont get pregnant anymore so they have no need for abortions he said The report also noted that the rate of abortions had declined in 1983 to 23 for every 1000 women 15 to 44 years old from a peak of 25 abortions per 1000 women in 1980 It could be that more women are using contraceptives these days so there are less unwanted pregnancies Dr Atrash said The CDCs researchers hope to further analyze the statistics to draw other conclusions he said Washington Is Highest The District of Columbia reported the nations highest abortion rate in 1982 and 1983  more than 100 abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years old West Virginia reported the lowest rate  six abortions per 1000 women in that age group The report noted that the percentage of abortions among teenagers was also declining In 1983 27 percent of the abortions occurred among teenagers compared with 29 percent in 1980 the study indicated According to the report white women were statistically less likely to have abortions than minority women In 1983 497 abortions occurred for every 1000 live births by blacks or females of other minority groups compared with 302 abortions per 1000 live births by white females The greatest actual number of abortions was reported in 1982 and 1983 in California The study reported 209481 abortions for that state in 1983 up from 207099 in 1982 Wyoming reported the lowest actual number of abortions 711 abortions in 1983 up from 698 a year earlier
"For Koch and Cardinal, A Hit in the Making?",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/nyregion/for-koch-and-cardinal-a-hit-in-the-making.html,The joint book planned by Mayor Koch and John Cardinal OConnor is literally an overnight hit The morning after their project became public the coauthors yesterday got a publisher striking a deal that could yield 1 million to their chosen charities The Hearst Corporation said it would publish the book  a written debate of such issues as abortion and homosexual rights  in hard and soft cover excerpt it in one of its magazines and serialize it in its newspapers Whatever You Say Mr Koch said his reaction when the deal was broached was From my point of view its OK but I got to call my partner So I called the Cardinal And he had already received a call from Hearst the Mayor said and he said whatever you say is OK  hes leaving it to his Jewish partner to make all the business decisions The Mayor called the agreement with Hearst an offer that couldnt possibly be refused Hearst said that it would donate its profits to the authors charities In addition the authors will turn over to charities these proceeds a 200000 advance any royalties for the hardcover edition which will be published by the Hearstowned William Morrow  Company and for the softcover edition to be published by Hearsts Avon Books and fees for reprinting of excerpts by Good Housekeeping magazine and newspaper serialization by King Features both owned by Hearst Hearsts president and chief executive officer Frank A Bennack Jr and its board chairman Randolph A Hearst joined the Mayor in his office at City Hall to announce their oral agreement Separation of church and state revenues from the book will be 5050 with the Mayor and the Cardinal splitting the money among municipal and religious agencies The Mayor has designated his half to go to the Meals on Wheels program and to the Municipal Archives The Cardinal will give his share to Catholic Charities which runs foster homes kitchens for the poor medical care programs and shelters for the homeless for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York The archdiocese encompasses Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City Hopefully well build a very good pot of money for charity Mr Bennack said He declined to forecast the ultimate proceeds but when asked if it could amount to 1 million he described that figure as possible and not an unreasonable estimate Messages Waiting When Mr Koch arrived at City Hall yesterday morning messages were waiting for him from four other publishers interested in printing the book But Hearst got to the authors first and may have had the best offer The weekend maneuvering began at 715 AM on Sunday when Lawrence Hughes the president of Hearsts trade book group read an article in The New York Times on the book He quickly sent telegrams to the Mayor and the Cardinal offering a 200000 advance  double the figure Mr Koch was quoted as saying they would accept Mr Hughes then spoke with Mr Bennack who also had read the article and was eager about obtaining the publishing rights Mr Bennack raised the ante with the concept of donating the companys profits He saw this as a wonderful opporunity to give money to charity Mr Hughes said so he got hold of the Mayor The Mayor said We cant do better than get the royalties and the profits so I think wed better take it Beyond Differences The Mayor as the citys top elected official and the Cardinal perhaps its most powerful religious leader have developed a friendship transcending their serious differences over key public policy issues Although the book will explore those serious issues light banter preoccupied yesterdays discussion When the Good Houskeeping reprint was mentioned the Mayor interjected Ill also throw in a recipe Asked when he expected to get the Mayors manuscript Mr Bennack said Were going to get on his case right away Mr Koch replied I dont suffer from writers block The plan is to produce the book in a year or so No decision has been reached on the price of the hardcover edition but Mr Bennack said 1495 to 1995  I would think thats the range Mr Koch expressed hope that every Catholic and every Jew would buy a copy Nothing sells like controversy the Mayor said

Bleak Lives: Women Carrying AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/27/nyregion/bleak-lives-women-carrying-aids.html,The number of women in New York City who are infected with the AIDS virus but free of the symptoms of the disease has now reached 50000 Eighty percent are black or Hispanic And they have become the primary carriers of the disease from the world of drug abuse to the larger community making their education an increasingly urgent task Their lives  chaotic and impoverished  are confounding public health officials as they seek to contain a widening epidemic that now hits hardest in neighborhoods where drugs are rampant Passivity and Denial According to the doctors nurses and social workers who counsel the women aware of their infection many of them particularly the drug addicts react with passivity and denial They are not using condoms that can arrest the spread of AIDS And they are becoming pregnant despite the knowledge that they could infect a fetus and bearing children many of whom will die But another category of these infected women the sex partners of men who have injected drugs are behaving far more responsibly  protecting their mates and avoiding or terminating unwanted pregnancies To these women the counselors are preaching the feminist message that women can take control of their lives even in the face of poverty illness and death Health officials say the vast majority of infected women both those in the inner city of all races and the few others who have acquired the virus from bisexual men or from blood transfusions are unaware they carry and can spread AIDS The disease has already killed more than 700 women in New York and more than twice that number nationwide With the passage of time scientists are becoming persuaded that all of those infected will eventually develop the symptoms and die Poor women often do not know that AIDS is transmitted by heterosexual sex so health officials are seeking to promote counseling and voluntary testing particularly at familyplanning clinics where such programs are largely unavailable These women live in environments where they cant escape men who are drug abusers said Dr Sheldon Landesman who is directing a study on AIDS and women at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn And once large numbers of nondrug addicted women get infected the ballgames over Like so many of the infected women Laura found out she harbored the AIDS virus after the last of her three children was born with the deadly disease My first reaction was to put a pillow over the babys face and to blow my brains out she said in an interview in her room in a welfare hotel According to Lauras account corroborated in large part by her social worker at a Bronx hospital she was infected by a drugabusing boyfriend She is not herself an addict Lauras last name has been omitted She is afraid of being located by her boyfriend who she says beat her repeatedly Devastating News Lauras boyfriend the father of the sick child was in jail at the time she and the baby were diagnosed If I had him in front of me Id have killed him with my bare hands she said Id feel better if Id gotten the disease from drugs instead of from some lowlife A 26yearold high school dropout Laura was told the devastating news about a year ago and it turned upsidedown a life that was already precarious Since then she has been hospitalized twice in psychiatric wards She has placed all three of her children in foster care with relatives because she was unable to cope with mothering them She returned to her boyfriend when he was released from jail because she was afraid of being alone the rest of my life then had unprotected intercourse and got pregnant He was still using drugs stealing her welfare checks and beating her So Laura fled sleeping for several days on roofs and in stairwells before seeking help from her social worker A Support Group Laura then had an abortion and later a tubal ligation For a while Laura abstained from sex then she met a man and broached the subject of AIDS and condoms Horrified he disappeared Now she said she is dating another man who does not know she carries the virus but who agreed to use condoms because he knows she spent years with a junkie and is therefore at risk Laura fears the relationship will eventually be crippled by her dishonesty but says she wont chance losing him because she can barely imagine life without a man I finally met my Prince Charming and what can I give him she said Lauras social worker runs a support group for women whose lives have been scarred by AIDS Here with chairs drawn into a tight circle workingclass women and those on public assistance trade autobiographical stories as collegeeducated middleclass women did a dozen years ago during the heyday of consciousnessraising groups It helped me to realize Im somebody Laura said I Try Not to Think About It For now Laura is free of the wasting symptoms of AIDS but understands that in all likelihood she will get sick and die I read the odds and the percentages she said I know what will eventually happen Im scared dont get me wrong but as long as my kids are safe I can lie down and be at peace I just hope I dont suffer much but I try not to think about it a lot The way I ruined my life I know one thing  Im not going up there to God More immediate for Laura is the sting of being shunned by some relatives I have an uncle who wont sit in the same room she said I guess hes afraid hell breathe my air There are family things Im not allowed at when hes there Lauras room in the welfare hotel is decorated with pictures of her children clustered around her in happier times Hanging from the mirror is a pair of baby shoes Laura writes letters to the children intended for delivery after her death that explain why she gave them up and how much she loved them The hurt Im bringing to everybody else is what really bothers me she said The Obstacles To Change In some ways Lauras situation represents a bestcase scenario since she has placed her children in stable homes is using condoms and is not bearing children Far more common are the unruly lives that doctors and nurses grapple with in studies of women and AIDS now under way at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and the Health Science Center in Brooklyn Studies such as these have helped establish the infection rate among women in New York City Similar national data are not available although experts estimate that at least 100000 women nationwide probably carry the virus While women represent 7 percent of the AIDS cases across the nation they represent 11 percent in New York where drug abuse is endemic At the Brooklyn center Dr Howard Minkoff director of obstetrics is now treating 15 infected women who have each had one baby with AIDS and are in the midst of pregnancies At the Bronx hospital according to Verna Robertson a nurse practitioner involved in one AIDS study none of the infected women use condoms all the time and more than half who become pregnant have their babies despite being told there is a 5050 chance the newborn will have AIDS Translating awareness into behavior is most difficult said Dr Peter A Selwyn of Montefiore Nobody has any magic solutions Among the infected women involved in these studies is Judy  her name has been changed to protect her privacy  who is in a methadone program expecting a baby and living in an abandoned building with a man who abuses her This AIDS is nothin Judy told her counselor I gotta worry where Im gonna sleep tonight and whether hes gonna beat me Counselors who work in the inner city say these women and others believe themselves to be powerless to change their lives Theres the sense that fates and destinies are in control said Susan Holman coordinator of the Brooklyn study Dooley Worth who does similar counseling on the Lower East Side said All the problems they live with on a daytoday basis wind up making them so passive For them passivity is a means of coping 3 Recommendations For a woman infected with AIDS or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome most counselors urge three behavior changes using condoms avoiding pregancy and staying free of drugs The last they find is the easiest They feel they have more control over that than the sexual part Ms Robertson said You see thats just dealing with their own behavior not someone elses or the pressures of a relationship Health experts report that all women have great difficulty persuading men to wear condoms but that such conversations are especially troublesome for Hispanic women who account for more than a third of the local female AIDS cases According to Miquel Arenas the director of an AIDS testing center run by the New York City Health Department Hispanic men often refuse to use a condom and sometimes are abusive if asked Mr Arenas traced this attitude to the sense of masculinity that is so important to Latin men and the pervasive influence of the Catholic church in the Barrio In the black community there has been a longstanding discussion about whether encouraging the use of condoms is a form of population control It can sound genocidal or at least insensitive said Suki Ports the director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS At Montefiore Dr Selwyn said he agonizes over the implications of this sort of reproductive counseling When youre talking about AIDS and women youre talking about blacks and Hispanics he said There are people out there who would find it suitable if these women stopped having babies altogether It is too easy to feed into those racist agendas The real danger Dr Selwyn said is that counselors will ignore the hobbling circumstances of these womens lives Any intervention program must appreciate their situations he said If you come in with a heavyhanded message that is unacceptable for ethical and social reasons and also wont have the desired effects Dr Selwyn and his counterparts in Brooklyn described an attitude that would predispose a woman to continue a pregnancy even in the face of AIDS In poor black and Hispanic communities they say women often depend on their men and their babies for both pleasure and selfesteem Reproductive and sexual relations are a very important part of their lives said Dr Minkoff Its not like they can say Im depressed so Ill go to Bloomingdales If they have a child theyre respected and valued The women sometimes explain that they want another child to leave something behind in the face of death that they view a 5050 chance of having a healthy baby as acceptable odds But counselors say these explanations usually do not surface until a pregnancy has proceeded past the point when abortion is possible They wind up having babies more by default than intent Ms Robertson said The Process Of Giving Help Rhonda a 24yearold Harlem woman was tested for the virus under prodding by physicians who were caring for her husband a onetime drug user who already had an advanced form of AIDS She is one of the small number of women  several hundred out of the 50000 who are infected  who have turned to the City Health Department for extended counseling Were only seeing the most motivated ones said Ms Worth whose counseling groups at the Stuyvesant Polyclinic are run in conjunction with the city The counseling begins either on a telephone hot line or at one of two city sites where 1437 women have been tested for the virus with 36 of them showing evidence of infection Overall 50485 people have been tested citywide including those tested by their private physicians Data are not available about the sexual breakdown of those tested or the percentage who are infected 3 of Women Infected Experts have now extrapolated that 50000 women are infected most of them untested and unaware They represent 3 percent of the citys women of reproductive age The infection rate is thought to be 50 percent among women who use drugs and 20 percent among those whose mates are addicts Counselors at the test sites talk at length with their patients both before their blood is drawn and when they return for the results But experts acknowledge that it usually takes weeks or months for the shock of a diagnosis to sink in so the most useful counseling must come later Mr Arenas the director of a city test site gives his patients information on followup care to pursue after their minds have cleared But since patients are identified only by a threedigit number to maintain privacy there is no way to keep in touch with them Most of them just get lost Mr Arenas said For the few who seek followup counseling like Rhonda there are common stages of denial anger and a sort of uneasy acceptance Often they talk of suicide their counselors said but they rarely kill themselves Instead slowing and painfully they figure out whom to confide in how to conduct their relationships with men how to provide for the future of their children As one of them said to me Nothing about my life will ever be the same  Ms Worth said Getting by day by day thats the hard part Once the women understand that death is not necessarily imminent they stuggle with the agony of not knowing what will happen next I look in the mirror every day and ask myself Do I look sick said Rhonda Every time I get a cold I think Im going to die Ms Worth said the women in her group worry that every symptom is the beginning of the downward trajectory But this reaction seems to be limited to the middle class Among the poorest women there is no demonstrated concern about their physical wellbeing experts say Skirting the Issue Another telling difference between women of various socioeconomic backgrounds is their comfort in a grouptherapy setting Ms Ports of the Minority Task Force noted that poor women unlike gay men or women of the middle class are not able to talk it out talk it out endlessly In counseling groups a limited kind of control is offered as an antidote to the uncertainty and powerlessness that come with an AIDS diagnosis Women are urged to eat well get a lot of rest exercise and stay off drugs if they are former addicts People need to be able to feel they can have some impact Ms Worth said There was a time when counselors assured people that a positive test did not mean they would get AIDS These days they do not say that and instead skirt the issue As the epidemic progresses it has become clear that virtually everyone who is infected will become gravely ill There is a persistent toll of morbidity and mortality that does not let up with time said Dr Stephen C Joseph the City Health Commissioner I dont tell people theyre not going to get sick Mr Arenas said But I also dont say everyone eventually gets AIDS That would not serve any theraputic purpose Despite limited success in educating the women at highest risk Dr Jospeh and others are determined to persevere since their infection is the primary bridge that transports AIDS from the gay and drugabusing worlds into the larger community Public health officials have been criticized in some quarters including among feminists for directing their preventive education at women but Dr Joseph defends this strategy as realistic and practical Let me expose my own bias here he said I think women generally have a more sharply defined sense of the future than men And I think they tend to be more responsible about health issues This is where we stand a chance of having some success
WASHINGTON TALK: AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH; Of Science and Sabotage,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/27/us/washington-talk-agricultural-research-of-science-and-sabotage.html,Maintenance workers at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center repaired fences this week and painters prepared to cover the slogans  Stop the Slaughter  sprayed in black on the creamcolored walls of an animal containment building Meanwhile scientists were drawing up new security plans to prevent more sabotage of experiments at the United States Department of Agricultures premier farm research center after the theft last weekend of 11 cats infected with a parasite harmful to humans and animals One proposal was to install electronic alarms in all buildings housing animals Another was to add substantially to the centers tiny security force But a third idea offered by the National Institutes of Health demanded no new hardware or personnel The advice was for an education campaign both to insure that farm researchers treat animals humanely and to convince people like those who apparently stole the cats that animals involved in experiments to cure livestock diseases are performing an invaluable role and are not being mistreated A woman who said she took part in the raid said today that the cats were under a veterinarians care in the Maryland area and that after treatment they would be placed in homes Although not new concerns about how laboratory animals are treated are mounting as researchers push back the frontiers of science and at the same time test new areas of the publics sensitivity Experiments in which genes are transferred from humans and other species into livestock have caused some members of Congress and religious leaders to raise ethical questions Other experiments to determine the causes for disease in which research animals are deliberately infected have also caused concern In some cases the protests have escalated from marching with placards to deliberate sabotage Until the Beltsville incident  the first on a Federal agricultural research facility  research saboteurs had focused on freeing animals involved in medical research forcing the National Institutes of Health to develop its public education policy Now the bureaucracy within the Agriculture Department must confront the issue too At the Beltsville Center in Maryland 20 miles north of here scientists said they had long been certain that it would be attacked some day Now they are certain that an attack can happen again We arent sure how to prevent the next one short of turning this place into an armed camp said Dr Michael Ruff acting director of the Animal Parasitology Institute a 200acre compound within the Beltsville Center where the raid occurred Expensive Experiments Some of the worlds most prominent and expensive livestock experiments are being conducted within the Beltsville Centers 100 major laboratories and 700 other buildings But few of the centers buildings have alarms A force of 14 security officers is charged with patrolling the grounds three shifts a day meaning that one security officer normally makes the rounds on weekend shifts Dr Waldemar Klassen director of the Beltsville Center cited a need for more money for alarms and security officers and for public relations Agricultural scientists for 100 years have pretty much had a free hand to conduct research as they wish Dr Klassen said Suddenly the public is asking a lot of questions and maybe we need to do a better job at letting them know whats happening here But the publics concerns may not be as critical as those of laboratory employees In most instances according to Dr Charles McCarthy director of the Office for Protection of Research Risks at the NIH militant animal welfare groups that resort to sabotage are assisted by insiders who share misgivings about callous care Universities have added alarms and other security devices he said But its almost impossible to install security to prevent inside jobs A better way is to train everybody who comes into contact with research animals to understand what is going on and to appreciate the efforts being made to make the animals comfortable After the number of raids on medical facilities peaked three years ago the NIH strengthened its rules for caring for research animals Dr McCarthy said In 1984 the agency also introduced a seminar conducted in nine regions each year to teach researchers and technicians how to care for animals At the Beltsville Center the target of the raid was Building 1327 a onestory barracksstyle structure where Dr J P Dubey a veterinarian kept 31 cats involved in research on Toxoplasm gondii a cellular parasite that causes abortions in sheep and other livestock A group called Band of Mercy claimed responsibility for the raid In a phone call to The New York Times today the woman who said she had participated in the raid said that with the help of an employee the Band of Mercy had infiltrated the Animal Parasitology Institute compound at least six times in recent months to take photographs of animals housed in containment buildings The woman who would not identify herself said the cats had been mishandled describing some of them as caked in feces and others with distended stomachs One she said was missing an eye The group took 28 cats 14 of them kittens Seven miniature pigs also were stolen Dr Dubey vehemently denied that his research animals were suffering I did a lot to maintain the health of the cats he said They were in good shape What I do know is that a lot of work has been ruined

Appeals Court Voids Minnesota's Limits On Minors' Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/us/appeals-court-voids-minnesota-s-limits-on-minors-abortion.html,A Federal appeals court today struck down a Minnesota law that required women under 18 years old either to notify both parents or to obtain judicial approval before getting abortions Without disputing that teenagers could benefit from parental guidance the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said requiring such guidance may do more to fractionize the family integrity than preserve it and may be adverse to the best interests of the pregnant minor The ruling is significant because the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments this fall on an Illinois law somewhat similar to Minnesotas If the Minnesota ruling is appealed to the Supreme Court as expected both cases could become the first major abortion issue facing Justice Lewis F Powell Jrs successor in the next court term President Reagans nominee to succeed the retiring Justice is Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who has criticized Supreme Court decisions in favor of abortion rights The decision today also has implications for laws in 22 states that seek to encourage minors to tell their parents or obtain their consent before having abortions About half those laws are not now being enforced because of court orders Similar proposals are or soon will be pending before many other state legislatures including New Yorks New York like New Jersey and Connecticut now has no requirement of parental notification The 1981 Minnesota law requires women under 18 to tell both parents of their plans 48 hours before having an abortion or to ask a state judge to waive that requirement Last November it was held unconstitutional by Federal District Judge Donald Alsop of St Paul That was the first examination by any court of how a law requiring parental notification which has been encouraged by several Supreme Court rulings has worked in practice Appeals Court Affirms Ruling A threejudge panel of the appeals court unanimously affirmed Judge Alsops ruling and came down squarely on the side of those who argue that the law has burdened minors seeking abortions without serving its goal of providing those who were immature with parental support and guidance It was welcomed by abortion advocates and civil libertarians and denounced by antiabortion groups Judge Max Rosenn who wrote the decision cited testimony by abortion providers counselors and psychiatrists in the District Court trial He said they agreed that although family relationships benefit from voluntary and open communication compelling parental notice has an opposite effect it is almost always disastrous Judge Rosenn was joined in the opinion by Judge Donald P Lay Judge Gerald W Heaney concurred in a separate oneparagraph opinion In striking down the law the court said minors as well as adults had a constitutional right to choose an abortion It said that while states could encourage parental involvement in a minors decision on having an abortion the states right to regulate such a decision is not absolute Criticism and Notice of Appeal The State of Minnesota served notice that it would appeal Nancy Coster vice president of the Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life an antiabortion group that drafted the law said the decision shows to what ridiculous lengths the courts are willing to take the abortion liberty The court she added is saying a 12 or 13yearold girl can walk into an abortion clinic where the people have a financial interest in her getting an abortion and the court is presuming that those people know what is best for her better than her own parents do Lynn Paltrow an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing abortion providers minors and others who sued to strike down the law said the case is a major victory because the decision recognizes that parental notification laws in fact hurt minors and do nothing to foster intrafamily communication She added Although the decision narrowly focused on the devastating impact on teens and families of twoparent notification laws the case will put before the Supreme Court the unrefuted record of the catastrophic harm caused by parental consent Trauma in Court Is Cited The Supreme Court has held unconstitutional laws that gave parents an absolute veto over their daughters decisions It has said a prompt and confidential judicial procedure to bypass parents must be available both for minors deemed mature enough to make their own decisions and for immature minors whose best interests would be served by having abortions without parental consent But in upholding state requirements that minors submit to such a court procedure the majority has reasoned that immature minors could benefit from governmental encouragement to consult their parents The appeals court however said the evidence indicated that the Minnesota law did not in practice spur many teenagers to consult their parents Moreover it said requiring teenagers to go to court at all may inflict needless trauma at a time of great emotional stress especially since the system frequently requires the pregnant minor to make two or three trips of often great distances which may in part be because by the time the court proceeding is over it is too late in the day to still have the abortion The judges continued Although a notice requirement does not as in a consent statute enable a parent to exercise an absolute and unilateral veto regardless of the best interests of the minor it does add to the minors burdens at a time when she is confronted with a major personal decision of grave and indelible consequences  Telling One Parent Insufficient The laws requirements would not be met for instance if a minor notified one parent even if the other parent was no longer part of the household That minor would still need a court waiver to proceed with the abortion the appeals court noted Nonetheless the appeals court said it is relatively easy to persuade a judge to waive the requirement for parental notificaiton Judges have almost never denied a minor a requested abortion the court said In fact Minnesota judges approved more than 3500 requests for abortions from 1981 to 1986 while turning down only 9 requests  onequarter of 1 percent

A Daughter Lost to Faith,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/books/a-daughter-lost-to-faith.html,LOVINGKINDNESS By Anne Roiphe 279 pp New York Summit Books 1795 THERE are books that create an exhilaration close to ecstasy The reader feels like a tall building in darkness to which the owners return and floor by floor begin switching on the lights Such for me was the experience of reading Anne Roiphes new novel Lovingkindness Here is the keystone to a career of 20 years a novel that binds the authors entire work Familiar Roiphian themes are revisited in Lovingkindness the pendulum of generations each child seeking to undo the mistakes of her parents the gilded ghetto of her mothers life the immigrants culture shock her loss of contact with Judaism contemporary religions decay from vibrancy to stultification Families crumble moral structures give way There is feminist loneliness Finally there is the yearning for Judaism to serve Caesar Lovingkindness begins when Annie Johnson a feminist academic living a single orderly life in New York is rung from Jerusalem by her daughter Andrea Annie is what one of the Jerusalem characters would call a Hellenized Jew Andrea is the daughter all parents fear She is the child full of grace the Persephone abducted  or eloped  to the underworld Her mother raised her to be a flower of civilization Andrea has turned into a queen of darkness Tattooed a streetsmart slattern recently recovered from a third abortion she was last seen five months earlier leaving for Europe in a fit of boredom She informs her mother that she is living in a yeshiva reborn and renamed Please call me Sarai Sarai is chaste pious and clean Her only desire is to love and serve God get married to whomever is chosen by her spiritual mentors as a mate and have lots of pure Jewish babies Goodbye liberalism feminism and unpleasant personal habits Hello womb Is the Sarai personality another of Andreas passing enthusiasms  like the rattlesnake she had needled between her shoulder blades like the green rooster hair she once affected  Annie wonders She writes to the rabbi in charge of her daughter I do not have a wellorganized religious system with ritual and prayer but I have nevertheless found a way of holding my head up under the stars    I have placed a high value on the intellectual accomplishments of women I have supported the changes in America that have brought women more power more economic equity and have enabled them to see for themselves a wider variety of futures This opening is a triumph of justice I fear you will deprive my daughter of equality respect and choice The battle for AndreaSarai has begun What follows is on one level a profoundly moving dialogue between a mother and a daughter of the 1980s between a Demeter and a Persephone who has fled to what her mother considers the deepest area of darkness irrationality On another the dialogue is between the generations of the first half of the 20th century and those of the second half who cry for daily bread for their spirits who are fed if at all on guruvoodoo cake On a third level Lovingkindness is an argument between Lucifer and God  or for those as squeamish about religion as Annie is between Reason and Faith And it is the argument of a secular Jew with her soul As a young woman Annie married a gentile He died and she has remained a widow Now within she is ready for a union  but the outside Annie the scholar who resembles the New England spinsters she has studied and a high achiever balks Meanwhile over in Jerusalem a young man has been chosen as a husband for Sarai the pace of the battle quickens Her hip aching like Jacobs after he wrestled with the Angel Annie marches on the Holy City At this point my admiration for Ms Roiphes skill took flight On her own evidence in other writings she has never been deeply touched in her spirit never burnt by the living flame Yet she allows Sarai to know what Annie cannot that despite all the demands of intellectuals and moralists Judaism is spiritual One meets it on the spiritual level To ask that it be liberal rational nonpatriarchal is to miss the point  and the beauty and to ask that Judaism descend into the service of Caesar into the world of the outer life the territory of power morals and politics The plague of contemporary Israeli politics is a blurring of these realms the burning of bus shelters in Jerusalem by the Orthodox Rabbi Kahane Ms Roiphe brushes this issue aside and rushes on Such is the tension between Lucifer and God that until the last moments of Lovingkindness one does not know which side will prevail in Annies soul Ms Roiphe brings to the drawing of her main character such a depth of insight that the denouement  the reverse of what I wanted to happen  lifted the book from its pages exhilarated me with its elegance TRAPPED IN A YESHIVA A distraught woman with tears in her eyes approached Anne Roiphe three years ago after the author had finished addressing a group of Jewish feminists She told me that her daughter was trapped in a yeshiva in Israel and then pressed a book into my hands the author recalled the other day I thanked her put it in my pocketbook and went on and talked to the next person But when I got home and looked at the book it immediately struck me that this was something I could build a story around The encounter with the woman and her book Return to Judaism by the Israeli sociologist Janet Aviad  was the inspiration for Ms Roiphes latest work Lovingkindness the story of a feminist mother struggling to come to terms with her rebellious daughters newfound fundamentalism The work is part of a process of discovering her own Jewish identity that began almost a decade ago when Ms Roiphe probably best known as the author of Up the Sandbox wrote an article in The New York Times about celebrating Christmas in a Jewish home The storm of protest that followed led the author on an intellectual and spiritual journey that continues in Lovingkindness What I am Ms Roiphe said with her legs folded under her as she sat on a blue sofa in her Manhattan apartment just off Riverside Drive is both characters both the mother and the daughter It would be nice if one could have two lives and really be both    Maybe that is why we have children Still none of the five daughters in the Roiphe household have taken the path of the fictional daughter For that reason it was with some satisfaction that the author listened to a friend the other day who had just finished Lovingkindness I didnt know one of your daughters joined a fundamentalist yeshiva the friend said with some concern I said to myself Good I convinced them That is just what I wanted to do   ARI GOLDMAN
U.S. ISSUES LIMITS ON ABORTION AID BY FAMILY CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/us/us-issues-limits-on-abortion-aid-by-family-clinics.html,Proposed rules to prohibit abortionrelated activities by family planning clinics that receive Federal funds were announced today by Dr Otis R Bowen the Secretary of Health and Human Services The rules carry out a policy announced by President Reagan on July 30 and contain details that were not obvious from the Presidents statement Under the proposed rules a clinic where abortion counseling was conducted would be prohibited from receiving Federal funds even if such counseling was financed with private money Likewise a clinic receiving Federal money could not provide a pregnant woman with the name or telephone number of a doctor willing to perform an abortion even if the woman requested such information Thousands of Clinics Involved The rules also say family planning programs supported with Federal money may not lobby for the passage of proabortion legislation People who work on family planning issues said the practical effect of the proposed rules would be to cut off Federal money for thousands of clinics because their operators feel an ethical obligation to advise pregnant women of the availability of abortion Scott R Swirling executive director of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association which represents the recipients of Federal money said The clinics that now provide family planning services could not ethically operate under the proposed regulations because they would be required to direct poor pregnant women to prenatal care only They would be unable to provide these women with information on all the healthcare options available to wealthier women such as abortion He added If these rules are put into effect as the Administration intends we most likely will file suit to overturn them 60 Days for Comment The proposed rules are to be published in the Federal Register early next week People will have 60 days to file comments The Government must consider the comments before issuing final rules which would have the force of law The Governments family planning program was established in 1970 under Title X of the Public Health Service Act The law states that none of the funds appropriated under this statute shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning But under current guidelines clinics must provide counseling on all options including abortion if a woman with an unintended pregnancy requests such information Dr Bowen said the proposed rules would strengthen enforcement of the statutory prohibition on abortion These regulations make it perfectly clear that your tax dollars and mine will not be spent subsidizing or promoting abortion through the family planning program he said Ronald E Robertson general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services said in an interview today The basic purpose of Title X was to provide family planning services to prevent pregnancy and to provide counseling on adoption and infertility It was never meant to provide medical care or social services to pregnant women 142 Million Under Program In the current fiscal year the Title X program will provide 1425 million for family planning services and related activities through 3900 clinics that serve 43 million people Douglas Johnson legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee an antiabortion group praised the proposed rules saying They go a long way toward ending the practice of treating abortion as just another birthcontrol option Under the proposed rules a public hospital that performed abortions could receive Federal money for a family planning program but the two activities would have to be kept strictly separate For example if a recipient of Federal funds conducted abortionrelated activities and had a family planning project there would have to be separate waiting and examination rooms separate financial and medical records separate personnel files separate office space and equipment and separate entrances and exits The two programs could not share receptionists or telephones would have to operate under different names and would have to use different stationery according to the rules In addition officials of the Department of Health and Human Services said that a clinic receiving Federal aid could not use any of the Federal money to pay dues to an organization that devoted a substantial part of its time to lobbying Congress for liberalized abortion laws The department said the effect of such dues payments would be to encourage promote or advocate abortion and the Administration contends that the 1970 law prohibits such advocacy The department said it would abandon its longstanding program policy on abortion counseling and referral because of a recent Justice Department opinion that said the policy was in conflict with the 1970 law The Justice Department concluded in that opinion that all counseling and referral for abortion inevitably promote abortion according to a draft of the proposed rules The purpose of counseling programs for pregnant women is to provide information upon which a course of action may be based and it is clearly to be expected that some women receiving such counseling will select the option of abortion the proposed rule says in a summary of the Justice Departments reasoning Assurance Would Be Required The proposed rules completely prohibit referral for abortion As a condition for receiving Federal funds family planning programs would have to give the Government assurance that they would not offer abortion counseling or making any referrals that would help women obtain abortions The ban is necessary according to the rules because a clinic may actually be facilitating the abortion decision if it arranges transportation or makes an appointment for a pregnant woman with an abortion provider The rules stipulate that when a pregnant woman goes to a family planning clinic that has received Federal funds the clinic must refer her to a healthcare provider for prenatal medical care and delivery services Mr Robertson the Government lawyer said Once the blessed or unintended event occurs once the woman is with child the Title X program is no longer relevant Preventive family planning services are inappropriate There are numerous other Government and private programs to assist pregnant women
"Whose Pregnancy Is It, Anyway?",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/01/opinion/whose-pregnancy-is-it-anyway.html,A Federal appellate court last week struck down a Minnesota law requiring teenagers seeking abortions either to notify their parents or get a state judge to waive the requirement In doing so it also painted a sad portrait of certain American families  one that proves the humanity of the appellate court action Most teenagers do in fact consult their parents before seeking abortions Its those unlucky kids who feel that they cannot confide in their parents at whom this law is aimed And if their home situation was bad to begin with this law makes it worse Experts agreed Judge Max Rosenn wrote that although family relationships benefit from voluntary and open communication compelling parental notice has an opposite effect It is almost always disastrous In Minnesota Judge Rosenn pointed out 50 percent of all marriages end in divorce and 42 percent of all minors dont live with both biological parents But the law requires contacting both parents That means a pregnant teenager may have to hunt down a parent she has not heard from in years She may also find herself the reason for new outbursts of hostility Many Minnesota minors who live in socalled dysfunctional families live in fear of violence by family members In short because the law often does more harm than good the Federal court rules it fails to further the States assorted interests and is therefore unconstitutional Still the issue of parental notification remains and not only in Minnesota Twentytwo other states have similar statutes some enforced and some not Such laws are often defended on the grounds that they promote family values The evidence shows that compelling a pregnant teenager to confide in parents she doesnt trust doesnt strengthen the family Its more apt to sunder it

Bork Backers Flood Senate With Mail,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/03/us/bork-backers-flood-senate-with-mail.html,President Reagan has called Judge Robert H Bork a fairminded man of detachment and statesmanship but mail pouring into Congressional offices suggests that some of the Presidents conservative supporters have a much more pointed role in mind for the Supreme Court nominee The Senate Judiciary Committee is receiving thousands of letters from Bork supporters who say his ascension to the Court from the Federal appeals court here would mean the reversal of dozens of decisions including those on abortion school prayer and pornography One of the bluntest arguments is made by Dr Robert Grant chairman of the Christian Voice a political organization of evangelical Christians

Grants supporters could send their Senators It read As my representative in Congress I demand you confirm Judge Bork to this appointment Since the 1930s this nation has been burdened with a liberal majority on the Supreme Court No longer will I stand for it Either vote yes for Bork or count your self one vote short in your next election Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York a Republican

countless issues too numerous to mention including abortion school prayer business regulation product liability and the civil rights vs public health issues brought on by the AIDS epidemic will be settled before the Supreme Court he wrote The ultraliberal extremists who oppose the Bork nomimination Mr Kemp added realize with fearful dread that a Reagan majority on the Supreme Court will set back the liberal agenda a generation or more And if they can only stonewall President Reagans Supreme Court nominee for a few more months Mr Kemp added it might be a President Biden or President Dukakis appointing Ramsey Clark Rose Bird or Ralph Nader to the Supreme Court Congressional aides whose job it is to read and answer the mail said they could not remember a time when such intensity particularly from conservatives existed among constituents over a judicial nomination 33000 and Counting So far the Senate Judiciary Committee has received more than 33000 cards and letters on both sides of the Bork nomination which the President sent to Congress two months ago Surges have deposited more than 1900 such pieces of mail to the committee on a single day and even greater numbers are expected once its hearings on the nomination begin Sept 15 By comparison the Senate committee investigating the Irancontra affair had received only about 6000 letters halfway through its hearings Groups organized around issues of concern to liberals meanwhile have made it clear that the defeat of the nomination is their overriding priority for the rest of the year They have therefore also urged their supporters to appeal to their Congressmen In a recent letter soliciting support for the effort People for the American Way a liberal group said that confirmation of Judge Bork would be President Reagans greatest legacy and would dramatically shift the balance of the Supreme Court allowing it to institute the rightwing agenda that the American people and Congress have rejected time and time again A member of the Senate Judiciary staff said that recent letters appeared to be more negative toward the Bork nomination than earlier ones but that over all the mail was mostly favorable We received many more proBork letters than antiBork mail in the beginning but the antiBork mail is beginning to catch up the aide said Urgings From Falwell One of those who has urged his supporters to write Congress in favor of Judge Bork is the Rev Jerry Falwell leader of the Moral Majority and the PTL ministry Mr Falwell has told his followers that the lobbying campaign to have Judge Bork confirmed is the most important one in which we have engaged in years and that the future of America may be at stake By the time of his confirmation hearings Mr Bork is expected to have met individually with nearly all 14 members of the Judiciary Committee and with many of the 86 other senators One of the biggest obstacles so far is Senator Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania who has met twice with Mr Bork in what aides say were substantive encounters In a recent speech before a group of law enforcement officials the President said Judge Bork shared the detachment and statesmanship that marked the career of the man he would replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr He also contended that Judge Bork was in the tradition of such former Justices as Louis D Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter two role models to many Democrats Many of Mr Reagans supporters however tend to portray the opposition to Judge Borks nomination in stark political terms Phyllis Schlafly for example the head of the Eagle Forum a conservative political lobbying group wrote in a recent newsletter that liberal Democrats and some Republicans with the cooperation of big media are waging a political attack on Bork She added that two Democratic Senators  Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the Judiciary Committees chairman and Paul Simon of Illinois  should excuse themselves from service on the committee because they have a conflict of interest with their own Presidential campaigns They are using Bork she said to posture for media attention

Abortion Foe Gets 7 Years For Bombings,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/03/nyregion/abortion-foe-gets-7-years-for-bombings.html,A 37yearold fireworks expert was sentenced yesterday to seven years in prison for his role in the bombing of abortion clinics in New York City In a twohour hearing the man Dennis J Malvasi said he would not take part in such bombings again because of his loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church and to John Cardinal OConnor The Cardinal is my shepherd Mr Malvasi told Judge Thomas P Griesa in Federal District Court in Manhattan If he tells me I cannot thats an order I cannot do it because that would get me in trouble with the Almighty Mr Malvasi a former marine who served in Vietnam turned himself in Feb 24 after Cardinal OConnor made a televised appeal to him to surrender Limit on Parole Specified Under the sentence Mr Malvasi is to serve a minimum of four and a third to five and a third years before being eligible for parole As part of an agreement with the Government he pleaded guilty in June to bombing one clinic in Manhattan and to an attempted bombing of a Queens clinic and making a threatening telephone call concerning the first bomb Charges against him in two other bombings were dropped Judge Griesa asked if the defendant wished to say anything I only have one question to ask Mr Malvasi said Is abortion murder That under no circumstances is in my province to comment on Judge Griesa responded The judge later told Mr Malvasi that many people strongly and sincerely opposed abortion but that there were just as many who felt the other way They do not engage in violent acts with explosives the judge said Later Judge Griesa said Cardinal OConnor had respect for the laws of the United States and asked whether Mr Malvasi did also What the Cardinal says is the word Mr Malvasi replied If he says not to do it I cannot do it That supersedes mans law Whether its right or wrong thats his problem Throughout the proceedings Mr Malvasis lawyer Roland Thau described his client as a man torn between patriotism heroism devotion to country and opposition to abortion which he equated with killing Defendants Background Cited One of 13 children Mr Malvasi was sent to a religious school in upstate New York for 12 years beginning when he was 2 Mr Thau said He dropped out of school in the eighth grade After paying a woman 20 to pose as his mother he enlisted in the Marines where he learned to do destructive things in the name of patriotism and devotion Mr Thau said He learned to do it so well that when he was shipped back he was miserable Mr Thau said He added that life for the defendant was so painful cruel and sordid that he took refuge in religion after having turned to robbing minor organizedcrime figures to support himself Elliott B Jacobson the assistant United States attorney who prosecuted the case said Mr Malvasi often bought small handguns for himself and other individuals with records and supported himself by committing robberies God knows how many he has committed Mr Jacobson said Judge Griesa who reported receiving many letters advocating a harsh sentence said he had considered several factors including a clear effort and intent to avoid killing or harming other people and Mr Malvasis strong religious beliefs
A Test on AIDS For the Candidates,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/opinion/a-test-on-aids-for-the-candidates.html,LEAD Health care workers who distance themselves from AIDS are attracting attention Politicians particularly Presidential candidates who do so attract much less attention But political leaders neglect of the problem is as damaging to national security as health workers is to patients Health care workers who distance themselves from AIDS are attracting attention Politicians particularly Presidential candidates who do so attract much less attention But political leaders neglect of the problem is as damaging to national security as health workers is to patients Control of the AIDS epidemic requires tough national and Presidential decisions The following questions are addressed to all the candidates 1 How would you resolve conflicts between public health requirements and the right to privacy The 40000 Americans with AIDS thus far half of them dead have been largely gay males and intravenous drug users But AIDS is spreading More than a million Americans epidemiologists say will have AIDS before the next Presidents second term ends They will be mainly those already infected but huge numbers from all groups will get the virus To measure the effects of control measures testing is necessary Confidentiality can be respected What would you do to encourage testing for the virus and help identify contacts to remove the stigma from AIDS and when individual rights conflict with the public interest 2 Who will pay for treatment Insurance companies want blood tests from all applicants for health and life insurance so they can avoid writing policies for those who test positive This would increase the economic burden on patients families and state and local governments All medical costs in 1991 will probably exceed 15 billion and may be 10 times that a few years later Hospital costs for the average AIDS patient are about 150000 Care is often much cheaper and as good in decent nursing home hospice and home care settings but such facilities are in short supply How should the costs be managed Would your administration intervene 3 What would you do for drug abusers Intravenous drug abuse accounts for 20 percent of todays cases largely because of sharing of needles contaminated with viruscontaining blood Many experts say that providing sterile needles and more Methadone programs could slow the spread of the virus What do you think 4 What would you do to prevent AIDS in the newborn Every infant born to a woman who carries the virus is at risk AIDS in babies is as devastating in its symptoms and as uniformly fatal as in adults Would you offer pregnant carriers therapeutic abortions 5 How would you encourage research The HIV1 virus was identified as the cause of AIDS shortly after the disease was first described The quality and amount of basic research carried out in previous years made this possible But because the AIDS virus is entirely new to human populations and because its effects are very complex effective vaccines and drugs are likely to be years away The speed with which they are developed will be largely determined by the number of firstrate scientists who work on AIDS and related basic biology What steps would you take 6 What would be your educational program The absence of preventive and curative medications in the near future makes education especially crucial Contrary to popular belief the virus is difficult to transmit Only infected people can pass it on and only by sexual intercourse contact with blood or from mother to child Condoms reduce but dont eliminate the spread It is not transmitted by kissing touching eating together or sharing clothes room bed or toilet seats We need a major education program starting in the home and schools What are your plans 7 How would you promote international cooperation It is crucial if the worldwide epidemic is to be arrested It is perhaps more urgent for countries that are heavily involved like Zaire and Uganda and moderately involved like the United States than for those with much less disease like China and Japan The Reagan Administration has held back on support of the World Health Organization which plays a crucial role in tracing the disease and in devising preventive strategies What would you do for WHO What else would you do to foster international approaches 8 How would you set priorities AIDS will cost hundreds perhaps thousands of billions of dollars Its neglect could cost far more including possibly our nations survival In the face of already strained resources it is particularly urgent that we scrutinize not only health care programs but also the Federal budget for waste and for expendable activities Choices must be made How would you make them
"War on Abortion, and the Poor",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/opinion/war-on-abortion-and-the-poor.html,President Reagans proposed new rules for family planning clinics purport to reduce abortions Their main effect would be to harass the poor Every year more than four million women 80 percent of whom are lowincome visit the 4500 federally supported family planning clinics Some seek advice about contraception others want to know if they are pregnant and if so what their options are Poor women in other words ask the same questions that more affluent women ask their doctors and they deserve the same answers The Administrations new regulations for the Title X family planning program however would give them secondclass care Existing rules require that a federally funded clinic advise a pregnant woman of her options including abortion and if she asks it to provide a referral for abortion service The proposed rules would bar any mention of abortion women who cannot afford a private physician would be denied counseling thats routine for private health care This aggressive change would put the clinics in an ethical bind Complying with the new rule means that health professionals must sacrifice their right to give full medical information in order to receive Federal grants  which total 1425 million Ignoring the ban means cutting back on gynecological services desperately needed by poor women The new rule would also impose another burden Some organizations among them Planned Parenthood offer birth control services and counseling under Federal grants and also run privately funded abortion clinics Aware of this the proposed guidelines would require fastidious separation of any such abortion service It could not share space personnel medical records names phone numbers waiting rooms exits or entrances with the birth control facility Managers of such organizations would face heavy new costs for construction and red tape Such harassment of sound legal medical practice may play well to the antiabortion minority But its likely consequences are likely to be more unwanted pregnancies and more unsafe abortions The family planning groups gearing up to challenge the proposed rules in court deserve support

Faithful in a Frenzy As the U.S. Prepares For the Papal Parade,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/faithful-in-a-frenzy-as-the-us-prepares-for-the-papal-parade.html,People who admire the Pope people who dont and people who see a chance to make a buck are all gearing up for a huge crosscountry exercise in religious devotion  and some less spiritual pursuits  beginning next Thursday when John Paul II steps off a jetliner called Shepherd One at Miami International Airport For millions the Popes whirlwind American tour will be a peak of their spiritual lives a chance to see the Holy Father the successor to Peter and leader of 840 million Roman Catholics around the world But for those making the preparations the trip is a logistical nightmare covering nine cities in 10 days and then a quick excursion into Canadas Northwest Territories Highways are being turned into giant parking lots office workers are being sent home early and schools are being shut for the day Field hospitals are being set up by the dozens water stations by the hundreds and portable toilets by the thousands Nerves are being tested everywhere from Naidja Taylor a teenager practicing the speech she will deliver before the Pope in the Superdome to Secret Service agents trying to make sure that the bulletproofglass Popemobile actually one of two gets to each city before the Pope does People angry with the Pope are also preparing Womens groups upset about the churchs stand against abortion and against women as priests have already begun demonstrations at the Vatican Embassy in Washington These protests will continue in Washington and throughout the papal route Gay rights groups in San Francisco will demonstrate for equality in the church and against the Vaticans 1986 statement that homosexuality is an intrinsic moral evil Jews not mollified by Tuesdays meeting in Rome between Jewish leaders and the Pope are planning protests in Miami and San Francisco Meanwhile entrepreneurs have blanketed the papal route with I Saw Pope John Paul Tshirts and buttons as well as more unusual fare a 55 lawn sprinkler in shape of the Pontiff called Let Us Spray and 179 Pope masks that come complete with miter One national organizer estimates that 20 million people will gather to see the Pope at motorcades football stadiums auditoriums and cathedrals Among the crowds will be pilgrims from south of the border where immigration agents are preparing for 200000 Mexican visitors headed for a huge outdoor mass in San Antonio Officials hope they will then go home Security a Big Job Part of the preparation for those crowds involves some staggering security precautions Before the Pope parades along Biscayne Boulevard in Miami for example security forces will sweep the streets with bombdetecting devices weld manhole covers shut put up barricades and take down mailboxes In Detroit sharpshooters will be stationed atop buildings when the Pope emerges from Ford Auditorium to speak at the nearby Hart Plaza The numbers for just one city on the tour San Antonio There will be 1000 National Guardsmen 800 police officers and 400 sheriffs deputies In addition there will be 200 medical personnel on hand and the city ambulance fleet of 20 will be augmented by vans and private chartered ambulances It isnt all preparing for the worst however Officials in each of the cities playing host to John Paul are making every effort to let him know exactly where he is and give him something to remember their city by In New Orleans he will be greeted by the music of a Dixieland jazz band In Phoenix a huge mural evocative of the Grand Canyon will be the backdrop as he preaches and in Monterey Calif he will stand on a platform made of interlocking fruit and vegetable crates of local growers In San Francisco he will meet people including two Roman Catholic priests dying of AIDS Deviations From the Script At each stop the Pope will make a major address on a particular theme  Catholic education youth ecumenical relations agriculture health In each instance specially selected representatives will deliver public responses All of the texts have been approved in advance by the Vatican but deviations from the script are possible and could spark some controversy One of the few freewheeling meetings will be behind closed doors in Los Angeles with the 300 bishops of the United States But here too obedience is likely to prevail over dissent When Pope John Paul meets President Reagan in Miami at the start of his trip New Age followers believe that a historic convergence will occur they plan a rally outside the Biscayne Bay mansion to take advantage of this propitious time to pray for world peace and a cure for AIDS Mayor T Patton Adams of Columbia SC the next stop on the tour says We are going to show him some real Southern hospitality Banners saying Welcome Holy Father in Polish have already been hung on 200 city lampposts In the five hours the Pope is in South Carolinas capital the population is expected to double to nearly a million For local color it will be hard to beat New Orleans In addition to the Olympia Brass Band at the airport there will be a mini Mardi Gras complete with the throwing of doubloons at a rally for the Pope and 75000 young people at the Superdome At an outdoor mass at the University of New Orleans Al Hirt will trumpet Ave Maria for the Pope and 225000 other worshipers Comic Will Be Opening Act Organizers there and elsewhere have gone to great lengths to keep waiting crowds entertained There will be civic showcases ethnic dances and through satellite transmission live broadcasts of John Paul at his previous stops At Candlestick Park in San Francisco a comedian and former Catholic seminarian Michael Pritchard will open for the Pope In San Antonio where 500000 are expected for an outdoor mass keeping the crowd entertained is the least of some peoples worries The citys top public health official resigned her post a month ahead of schedule in protest warning that a lack of water and intense midday heat could lead to fatalities in the crowd Its too dangerous said the health chief Dr Katharine Rathbun And for the love of God dont bring your children The officials planning the visit however say the mass will be a safe one and are preparing with water fountains firstaid facilities and refreshment stands A 500voice choir will sing in English and Spanish Nuns from nearby are baking 300000 wholewheat communion wafers to be distributed by 1500 eucharistic ministers Quick Service at the Border As in other cities on the tour hotels in San Antonio have long been booked Some visitors might still find space though at the 31acre Pilgrimage Park with hookups for campers and carnival rides for children San Antonio the chief city in heavily Hispanic South Texas is also the closest stop to the Mexican border and immigration agents at Laredo plan special curbside service to speed the issuance of vistors permits Traffic lights will be reprogrammed to speed the flow from the border The immigration director at Laredo Alfonso DeLeon concedes that many Mexicans may use the opportunity to stay and work illegally in the United States But he is not discouraged We may not catch them this time he said but we will the next time presumably when they try to return to Mexico for a visit In Phoenix officials had hoped that the Pope would be able to visit the Grand Canyon When he couldnt they commissioned an artist to draw a 84by35foot scene of the mountains of the Southwest behind the platform at the Arizona State University stadium Those who fear braving the crowds in San Antonio and other major stops on the tour and who havent been invited to the many gatherings with smaller audiences still have a chance At Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey where the record crowd so far is 30000 Grateful Dead fans officials hoped the Pontiff would draw 100000 But the site has limited seats  only acres and acres of grass  and people must travel by bus to the site beginning at 3 AM for the mass that begins at 10 Demand for tickets has been so slack that to get rid of them the Monterey Diocese has set up a tollfree number 800 8581414 Some specially invited guests are 100 people with AIDS and their families who will have prominent seats for the Pontiffs appearance at Mission Delores the oldest church and one of the oldest buildings in San Francisco Finally in Detroit the Pope will get a taste of home on his last stop in the United States John Paul who will be addressing crowds in English and in Spanish throughout his American tour will speak in Hamtramck an ethnic enclave surrounded by Detroit in his native Polish
Major Libertarian Candidate Opposes Party Stand on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/major-libertarian-candidate-opposes-party-stand-on-abortion.html,As they meet here this weekend to pick a 1988 Presidential nominee the 321 delegates of the Libertarian Party have a problem arising from their long support of freedom of choice on abortions One of their leading candidates for the nomination is a staunch opponent of abortion The Libertarians who opened their national convention here today will select a Presidential nominee Saturday from four candidates One of them Ron Paul a former Republican Congressman from Texas opposes abortion The partys proposed platform supports the right of women to make a personal choice regarding the termination of pregnancy Mr Paul who joined the Libertarian Party last February said the division of opinion on abortion showed how the Libertarian Party had grown up since its founding in 1971 Russell Means a Sioux from South Dakota and a longtime advocate of American Indian causes is the other leading Presidential candidate He favors free choice in abortions and argues that by naming him the Libertarians will broaden their base Handcuffs on IRS Agents The other two candidates are Jim Lewis a bookbindery representative from Old Saybrook Conn and Harry Glenn a retired welder from St John Ind Mr Lewis told the delegates he expected to be tried as a tax protester when he returned home Mr Glenn said I want to put handcuffs on all the IRS agents The draft platform also contains a plank that supports research for a cure to AIDS and opposes government testing to locate victims of the disease But it would allow employers to require tests or dismiss victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome The plank supports the right of doctors and nurses to refuse to treat AIDS patients and the right of property owners to refuse to associate with AIDS victims Other planks urge the repeal of laws against crimes that do not involve victims oppose any kind of compulsory national service or limits on free speech and call for the abolition of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency They also seek the repeal of property taxes and compulsory education laws Libertarians want as little government and as much individual freedom as possible We place liberty at the core of all values Don Ernsberger said in the keynote address Mr Ernsberger also predicted that the partys ticket would make a good showing against the Democratic and Republican candidates whom he described as seven dwarfs and three stooges the most boring political election prospect since Warren Harding defeated James Cox in 1920 In the 1980 Presidential election the Libertarians had their national ticket on every state ballot and received 920000 votes In 1984 the Libertarian ticket was on 39 state ballots and received 228000 votes Hippies of the Right Several delegates said in interviews that they had been attracted to the party by reading the works of Ayn Rand the author of Fountainhead However Miss Rand who died in 1982 at the age of 77 spurned the party as a random collection of emotional hippies of the right who seek to play at politics without philosophy Mr Means said in an interview that he sought the nomination to help gain more freedom for American Indians In a questionandanswer session with the delegates he said he was different from men who have been President in that I committed my felony before I got to Washington Mr Means who took part in the Indian occupation of Wounded Knee SD in 1973 served a year in prison in South Dakota after being convicted of rioting and obstruction of justice Mr Paul a 52yearold physician represented the 22d Congressional District of Texas which includes the west side of Houston for seven years He left Congress in 1985 after an unsuccessful run for a seat in the United States Senate finishing second in the 1984 Republican primary behind Phil Gramm who went on to win the seat in the general election As a Congressman Mr Paul opposed nearly every form of government spending at home and was basically isolationist on foreign affairs He also urged a return to the gold standard and abolition of the Federal Reserve Board

Libertarians Pick Ex-Congressman in '88 Bid,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/us/libertarians-pick-ex-congressman-in-88-bid.html,Former Representative Ron Paul of Texas was nominated today as the Libertarian Partys candidate for President His closest rival in the vote at the partys national convention here was Russell Means the Indian leader from South Dakota Andre Marrou 48 years old who recently served a twoyear term in the Alaska Legislature was nominated as the Vice Presidential candidate without opposition Dr Paul a 52yearold obstetrician from Lake Jackson Tex a suburb of Houston served as a Republican member of Congress from 1979 to 1984 He drew 196 votes on the first ballot to 120 for Mr Means Trailing far behind were Jim Lewis of Old Saybrook Conn the 1984 Libertarian vice presidential nominee and Harry Glenn a retired welder from St John Ind Mr Lewis received 49 votes and Mr Glenn had 3 Fourteen delegates rejected all four candidates Recent Switches to Party Both leading candidates for the Presidential nomination became Libertarian Party members last February which made some delegates uneasy about the candidates dedication to the partys principles One of the delegates who had misgivings was John Vernon who said in a speech before the vote on the Presidential nomination I am concerned that the Libertarian Party can become known as the last refuge of the conservatives and that is not true We are a radical party I am concerned that the frontrunners joined the party to run for President While the Libertarian Party supports the right of women to choose an abortion Dr Paul believes that abortions are morally wrong A group called Libertarians for Life failed in its attempt to change the party position The voting for the Presidential nomination appeared to be influenced by delegate desires to broaden the partys base Mr Means was seen as potentially opening an avenue to ethnic minorities while Dr Paul was seen as offering the candidacy of a trained articulate political campaigner skilled at fundraising Dr Paul has raised about 250000 for his campaign and hopes to be able to win enough support to merit a place in the Presidential debates sponsored by the League of Women Voters The delegates also adopted a platform plank on military policy that calls for the United States to remove all its nuclear weapons from Europe and to terminate the 1972 agreement that limits antiballistic missile systems The plank calls for withdrawal of American military personnel stationed abroad The position that the convention adopted on dealing with the AIDS epidemic was less stringent than that proposed by the platform committee Language deleted included support for employerordered tests to identify those infected support for doctors and nurses who refused to treat AIDS patients and a call for prosecution of anyone who knowingly infects another person with the fatal disease The deletions left a platform plank that recognized the urgency of overcoming the problem but opposed all Governmentmandated tests to identify victims as mandated contact tracing and state intervention into the private medical records The plank also called for decriminalization of possession of hypodermic syringes
For Children: A Fair Chance,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/opinion/for-children-a-fair-chance.html,Stop Wasting Lives and Money On Tuesday a committee of business executives will publish a finding that could over the next 16 years change urban America After decades of disappointment with antipoverty programs society is discovering that it knows how to do something that works Concentrate on helping poor children in their earliest months and years of life The business leaders who joined with educators on a Committee for Economic Development research panel are not usually aroused by issues like prenatal health or enriched preschool education But now they are somethings stirring in the political underbrush With presidential candidates already attracted to childrens issues this could be the season to seize the moment Save Three Children Social welfare strategies have rolled in like waves First it was housing then services like social workers and clinics then income strategies None turned out to conquer poverty Early childhood intervention wont do that either But instinct and social science affirm its powerful promise Consider the famous Perry Preschool Project in Ypsilanti Mich In the early 1960s it began offering preschool to 3yearolds from poor homes and with belowaverage IQs In a rare longterm study researchers followed 123 children until their 19th birthdays They did remarkably well They graduated from high school and went on to jobs or more education at twice the rate of children without the additional early schooling They also had fewer arrests detentions and teenage prenancies A year or two of early schooling so enhanced the childrens confidence and sense of control that as the researchers reported their better performance is visible to everyone All the more reason not to wait until a child is 3 or 4 years old Why not start with prenatal care for frightened mothers often children themselves Why not provide classes in basic skills for fathers An array of such services could save three children at once The teenage mother her baby and the child she is persuaded to defer at least until she has finished school and gained both maturity and job skills Spend Where It Counts Americans are generous about social welfare when they know it works as with Head Start or food stamps But they have learned to feel for their wallets when experts talk grandly about new schemes Why should they react differently to early childhood intervention Because it is known to work Strong evidence comes from the Perry Project It cost 4818 per child in 1981 dollars But Ypsilanti recovered 3100 almost immediately the preschoolers required less remedial education and services Other dividends have mounted as the years pass Another kind of arithmetic shows that early childhood intervention pays off There were 240000 low birthweight babies born in 1984 Hospital costs during the newborn period averaged 20000 Complete prenatal and maternity care would have averaged about 3500  and probably would have produced healthier babies Experimental programs are already under way in several cities One of the most ambitious is the Beethoven Project in Chicagos Robert Taylor Homes the largest public housing project in the world The program provides prenatal care and parenting education for expectant mothers and eventually will offer developmental programs for infants and toddlers as well The idea is to deliver to the nearby Beethoven Elementary School in 1992 a class of kindergarten boys and girls physically mentally emotionally ready for school If the experiment proves out it will vindicate the conviction of the Committee for Economic Development panel that improving the prospects for disadvantaged children is not an expense but an excellent investment From Abortion to Consensus Attitudes about children have changed dramatically in the 15 years since thenPresident Nixon denounced thenSenator Mondales developmental day care bill as something like Godless communism Now its possible to identify and energize a potential coalition on behalf of early childhood intervention The issue engages basic and volatile issues like the sanctity of the family and parents right to raise their children by their own best lights Now black churches have mobilized to help young women deal with illegitimate babies and minority parents respond to voluntary programs Teenage mothers need and want all the help they can get People on both sides of the abortion debate who care about family values join comfortably to promote early childhood measures For instance Representative Henry Hyde the Illinois Republican who is a leader of the prolife movement sponsors legislation to give Federal health insurance to poor pregnant women Several Presidential hopefuls press for early childhood measures New York City is already developing a program for school at 4 In Congress the relevant Senate and House committees will conduct a rare joint hearing this week to consider early childhood legislation Such a consensus is promising To help children when help does the most good is an idea any citizen can appreciate Likewise the consequences of not helping children who lack a fair chance are also obvious Imagine a baby girl born into innercity poverty today to a teenage mother With an early childhood program shed be more likely to be born healthy her mother could give her better care and early schooling would enlarge her selfconfidence In 16 years shed probably be starting her last year in high school and have ambitions for the future Without such a program shes all too likely to have something else a baby And the heavy cycle will start again COSTEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS WIC Food for Women Infants Children Reduces infant mortality increases birthweight

TWO PARADOXICAL SAINTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/books/two-paradoxical-saints.html,DOROTHY DAY A Radical Devotion By Robert Coles 182 pp Reading Mass A Merloyd Lawrence BookAddisonWesley Publishing 1795 SIMONE WEIL A Modern Pilgrimage By Robert Coles 179 pp Reading Mass A Merloyd Lawrence BookAddisonWesley Publishing 1795 FEW of us really like saints Admire them yes but the demands they make on themselves inspire us to keep our distance Simone Weil and Dorothy Day aspired to the kind of intimacy with God that is typical of saints and each tried to live in such a way that as Emmanuel Cardinal Suhard of Paris said ones life would not make sense if God did not exist Both women lived and identified with the underclass both experienced religious conversions both were thinkers who became suspicious of the intellect both rallied against violence and war and if either had had her way we would all live simpler more communitarian lives than modern nations permit But they were very different pilgrims of the absolute Weil was only 34 when she died of tuberculosis and selfwilled malnutrition in 1943 alone and unpublished Day on the other hand was an exhausted 83 when she died in 1980 attended by her daughter and grandchild and by her extended family of Catholic Workers people who remain bonded by her vision Neither of Robert Coless volumes which appear in the Radcliffe Biography series is biography Instead Dr Coles takes up certain themes and passions that preoccupied his subjects and wrestles with them as one might do with those of any figure who has become a lifelong spiritual companion If we come to understand Day better than Weil it is not only because Weils severe solitariness is so forbidding The main reason is that Dr Coles draws on correspondence and conversations he had with Day including 50 hours of taped interviews conducted in the decade before her death There are rewards here even for those who have read Days autobiography The Long Loneliness Under Dr Coless prompting she recalls the excitement of her 20s when she lived in Greenwich Village wrote for leftist journals stayed up all night talking and smoking fell in love with several men and had an abortion What comes across is her profound attraction to all of human experience  the pull of the sea the ecstasies of sex the warmth of companionship and the bliss of producing a daughter by a commonlaw husband whose birth paradoxically triggered her own rebirth as a rather austere Roman Catholic I wanted to be poor chaste and obedient she told Dr Coles I loved the church for Christ made visible What she didnt like was the mass of Catholics including clergy who accepted the church but refused to follow Jesus or refract his harsh and dangerous love The Catholic Worker movement which she founded with Peter Maurin was her response What emerges from these conversations is a woman whose Christian spirituality was radically rooted like the Bible in the concrete and specific  notably in serving this drunk that crazed drifter and all the homeless individuals who showed up daily at the Workers houses of hospitality She fasted and picketed against war including American participation in both world wars and other large social evils but she distrusted what she called morality in the abstract which too easily ignores the neighbor in front of us But for me the heart of our work is just that she told Dr Coles after he reminded her of her lifelong opposition to the welfare state making the soup and serving it trying to help someone get to the hospital who otherwise might not get there because hes confused because shes not aware she even needs to go there The point was not to be effective humanitarians but to do as Jesus bade Lest he miss the center of the Workers life she reminded Dr Coles We pray Her life of prayer was concrete too formed by a sense of connection daily mass with its communion of body and blood the kneading of the rosary and above all an almost tactile reliance on the Bible which she read daily The abstractions of theology put Day off She found more of the soul in her favorite storytellers notably Dostoyevsky Tolstoy and Ignazio Silone plus the lives of saints like Therese of Lisieux Indeed the only possessions she found difficult to share were her favorite books Day thank God had her vices As Dr Coles makes wonderfully plain she could be a scold and she had the spiritual sense to recognize her repeated sins of pride which she aggravated by efforts at selflessness In the end Dr Coles finds she wisely declared a truce in her battle for spiritual perfection What is missing from this otherwise revealing probe by Dr Coles whose chief professional concern has been with what he calls children of crisis is how Days extraordinary life affected her daughter Tamar Teresa Parents can pass on their faith but even saints cannot transmit their friendship with God to the next generation Simone Weil on the other hand was a solitary spiritual migrant cut off from the living faith of her people the Jews and from the sacraments of the Roman church which she judged herself unworthy to accept A dazzingly brilliant student and keen social observer her passions were of the spirit food she seemed to feel was something to renounce and marriage she wrote is a consented rape And so she added is the souls union with God To Dr Coles irony and paradox are the very conditions of life and in Weil he finds much to try to explain Straight off he confronts her probable suicide and links it  successfully I think  with her lifelong aspiration to the condition of hunger not only as a way of sharing the deprivations of those who suffer but as a spiritual condition of those who as she put it are waiting for God Dr Coles also focuses on Weils evident antiSemitism suggesting that it was part of a more fundamental effort to assert her independence from the conventions and constraints the gravity of this earthly life Her Christianity is even harder to account for Drawn to the figure of Jesus and the folk Catholicism of the poor she nonetheless refused to accept baptism What she took from Christianity was the cross and with it a fierce hunger for God that allowed her to see in every enhancement of self a diminution of God Salvation she declared is consenting to die Like Day Weil understood that Christianity inverts accepted human values and in her powerful essays she pushed paradox to its limit Dr Coles tries hard but in the end he cannot bring Weil into reliable focus No one else has either The chief reason is that like Soren Kierkegaard Weil lives essentially in her writings and they resist commentary Still it is well worth having both of the Coles books for what they tell us about the life of the spirit Together they suggest that for those who hunger for God the hardest test may be accepting the paradox that He has pitched his tent among us and we are to call it home
FRAMING THE ISSUES; The Presidential Contenders Seek to Make Their Mark,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/weekinreview/framing-the-issues-the-presidential-contenders-seek-to-make-their-mark.html,BY tradition Labor Day is the opening day for general election campaigns Labor Day of the Presidential election year that is The primary season begins some months earlier when the primaries do and the preprimary period at some undefined time before that generally the previous fall But this time in part because the election industry has become a perpetual motion machine and in part because the primary schedule has been accelerated the 1988 Presidential cycle has begun early  very early Not every candidate has formally announced more may yet enter  events might still attract some like Governor Cuomo of New York who have said they are not candidates  and more will drop out But the field is crowded early and all summer people who aspire to the Presidency have been stumping the country telling voters that Election Day 1988 will produce a leader for the next decade perhaps even set the tone for the next century Candidates who have experience have been emphasizing it Sometimes they have also talked about the issues  subjects that are constants such as the economy and the farm problem and subjects that have been thrown up by current events such as the Bork nomination and the AIDS epidemic What follows is an outline of the issues and highlights of what the candidates have been saying about them THE CONSTANTS Farm Policy Agriculture is first among equals for the candidates attention as much because of the calendar as because of the importance of the farmers plight The Iowa caucuses Feb 8 are the first voting of 1988 and so the early campaign trail leads through a lot of cornfields Every one of the 14 people running or saying they are tending to run for President has been working the issue hard few harder than Senator Bob Dole who intertwines it with a personal message He is the Senator from Kansas says the only candidate who comes from the heartland although Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri or Senator Paul Simon of Illinois might dispute that and he knows the language of the farmers and their needs As evidence of his ability to influence farm policy he cites passage of the 1985 farm bill at 85 billion over three years But no approach to the issue is more attentiongrabbing than that of former Gov Pierre S du Pont 4th of Delaware who as one of the lesser known contenders needs to make people sit up and listen Leaving the others arguing over how best to finetune current policies he calls for eliminating all farm subsidies over a fiveyear period The reaction of former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr is typical He tries to have it both ways calling a freemarket farm economy a laudable goal but not one close at hand after 40 years of price supports There is also a lot of talk in both parties about rural development and alternative uses for farm products such as ethanol Support for the develoment of alcohol fuels has the additional benefit of promoting energy independence if not the energy industry THE ECONOMY Trade Competitiveness called in some jaded circles the c word is the upscale side of the trade issue which as whole public opinion polls show is a concern to older voters who tend to turn out because they associate the 170 billion trade deficit with the loss of American jobs Representative Gephardt is trying hard to corner the market on competitiveness offering the socalled Gephardt amendment to the 1987 trade bill which would aim retaliatory measures at countries deemed to have behaved unfairly in American markets Trade is also central to Representative Patricia Schroeders campaign in the form of a crowdpleaser called burden sharing which links trade to military outlays like this An ally that does not spend the same percentage of its gross national product on the military as the United States does read Japan would risk tariffs on its exports The rest of the Democrats are massed protectively against Mr Gephardts charges that they are soft and the Republicans antiprotectionist barbs Senator Albert Gore Jr is characteristically playing the center Senator Joseph R Biden Jr remarks occasionally that import quotas should be converted to tariffs which he notes would at the earn the Treasury some money Taxes The Federal deficit is down to 221 billion this year but is due to rise again without further cuts in spending or new taxes Both are sensitive subjects the latter particularly so for Democrats who remember that Walter F Mondales frank promise to raise taxes helped fatally wound his 1984 Presidential campaign Former Gov Bruce Babbitt is the first of the candidates of 1988 to be as he puts it candid The plain fact he says is we do need to raise revenues He would do the job with a 5 percent Federal sales or consumption tax bringing in 40 to 50 billion a year But the Rev Jesse Jackson who also ran in 1984 has always talked about taxation emphasizing a corporate levy aimed at redressing economic injustice as well as attacking the deficit The other Democrats offer such revenueraising strategies as a tax amnesty oil import fees  a sure seller in the energy states but a downer in the Northeast  excise taxes or tariffs and military spending cuts Among the Republicans Mr Haig and Vice President George Bush distinguish themselves Mr Haig for his criticism of the Reagan Administrations fiscal flabbery and Mr Bush for his wholesale adoption of policies that he used to call voodoo economics Mr Bush now uses the same words President Reagan does when calling for a lineitem veto and a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget Then there is the Rev Pat Robertson a supporter of the flat tax like the purists who argue that the tax system should never be used as a social policy tool and everyone should be taxed at the same rate He is nevertheless big on tax incentives Growth Economic growth is the central topic of Gov Michael S Dukakiss campaign During his tenure Massachusetts transformed itself from industrial poverty to postindustrial prosperity and he wont let anyone forget it Indeed the Democrats generally are decked out in managers suits Eager to demonstrate how businesslike they are many are big on socalled payforperformance devices to reward productive workers and industries  a shift in emphasis that organized labor once solidly on the Democratic line is not keen about As for the Republicans all claim credit to some degree for being on board during the Reagan recovery almost all do a good deal of public worrying about the deficit Mr du Pont and Representative Jack Kemp are alone in fervent advocacy of supplyside economics with Mr du Pont boasting about how well tax cuts worked to boost Delaware when he was Governor and Mr Kemp hearkening back to his preReagan advocacy of steep tax cuts on the Federal level THE CITIES Among the Democrats there is not much out there this year on urban problems a subject once high on the partys agenda Only Mr Jackson goes beyond vague promises to help Key to his platform is an American Investment Bank Deposits would flow not from Washington but from investments of pension fund balances it would write checks for housing transportation education and community development rural and urban for the benefit of working people Among the Republicans Mr Robertson a staunch advocate of privatization would replace direct Federal grants to government entities with tax checkoffs for people Say a New Yorker wanted Westway for example his contribution to it would reduce his Federal tax Representative Kemp meanwhile tirelessly promotes his enterprise zone tax breaks for businesses setting up in depressed areas Senator Dole uses urban issues the way he does many others to hammer to Republican audiences no matter where the need for the party to change its image Id like to see 50 wheelchairs in this audience 50 black faces 50 Hispanics 50 AsianAmericans The problem with the Republicans he says is that were sort of a hardhearted party the upper crust EDUCATION Candidates trying to prune this thorny issue into a plant that will bear fruit have a powerful incentive The postwar generation familiarly known as the Baby Boomers will account for 60 percent of the votingage population in 1988 and its members are at the childbearing age Children are central to Senator Bidens campaign He emphasizes particularly education for young children Higher education is a key item for Vice President Bush who favors spending some not a lot more money for education generally and proposes college tuition savings bonds which would work the way Individual Retirement Accounts do Interest would be tax free unless the money was not used for college costs SOCIAL POLICY Welfare Like the farm welfare  or rather how to turn welfare to work  is a hot subject And as with farms former Governor du Ponts version is attentiongetting Ablebodied people would no longer be eligible for welfare or food stamps if they could not find jobs in the private sector they would be offered government work at 90 percent of the minimum wage Among the Democrats Governor Dukakis uses the welfare issue as he does any issue he can to emphasize his practice over everyone elses theory citing the successes of employment training programs in Massachusetts Abortion High on the list of things that most candidates dont want to talk about is abortion But when pushed the Republicans generally oppose legalized abortion and the Democrats are generally prochoice Representative Gephardt last year came into line retreating from his support for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion on the ground that there was no public consensus on the matter Before 1980 Vice President Bush was against an amendment and for Federal financing for abortions in certain cases he joined the other Republicans when he switched on both explaining when pressed in 1984 that 15 million abortions since 1980 persuaded him to change his views Social Insurance As usual Social Security is principally a Republican problem Representative Kemp who once said that Republicans who propose major changes in the retirement program for the elderly are candidates for a prefontal lobotomy is making a very big deal of being the sole true defender of the faith that is of the system as it stands Mr Kemp points out that Senator Dole and Vice President Bush both supported a freeze in benefits as part of a 1985 deficit reduction plan Mr du Pont saying he is the only responsible conservative on this one proposes an intricate and expensive privatization plan that would make Social Security partly voluntary Mr Babbitt the Democrat who treads where the others do not dare proposes  on occasion actually using the words  a kind of means test He would tax all Federal payments to couples who make over 30000 to pay for catastrophic health insurance for the elderly For Senator Simon a selfdescribed Democrat not a neoanything social insurance for the elderly is a key platform point He promises a selffinancing homebased and communitybased system Full Employment And the Workplace Another beacon for the old Democratic Party  a job for everyone who wants one  is Mr Simons main issue His guaranteed job opportunity program a 1980s style Works Progress Administration would cost 8 billion to be made up mostly in savings on welfare costs as publicly supported work at the minimum wage turned into permanent privatesector jobs that the government would help workers find As for workplace issues Representative Schroeder concentrates on gender A sponsor of the pending Family and Medical Leave Act she promises help for working families as well as attention to women in the labor force ARMAMENT AND DISARMAMENT Pentagon Spending The mainstream has cut a new channel that even the Army Corps of Engineers might not be able to dam and everyone is in it Pentagon spending has become a target and all the candidates have scrambled to the firing line Senator Dole who like Vice President Bush makes ready reference to his war record and the need for a strong defense puts it this way When somebody spends a budget of 312 billion youve got to know you could take some of it out of there without impairing our readiness Mr Robertsons variation on the theme is the promise of the same defense with less money Candidates who do not want to risk coming up with a precise number by which to cut military spending emphasize efficiency or competitive bidding or improved weapons testing Arms Control No one is against it though some frequently Republicans are sternly cautioning the nation to look before it leaps  in short dont be hoodwinked by Soviet glasnost into giving up Star Wars As former Governor du Pont would have it President Reagans spacedbased missile shield opens the way to a new era Among the Democrats Senator Gore who emphasizes his membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee and on the Senate Arms Control Observer Group has made arms control his concentration He offers a set of technical proposals for protocols and inspection systems aimed at preventing conventional as well as nuclear war ISSUES OF THE YEAR Judge Bork President Reagans nomination of Robert S Bork to the Supreme Court has presented the Democratic candidates with a great opportunity The judges name has been turned into to a code word that can be used to talk about tricky subjects without talking about them The list includes everything from the equal rights amendment to civil liberties but especially abortion rights  issues with vigorous constituencies that are not always comfortable allies for a mainstream bridge builder which all the Democratic candidates seem to need to be this season By being against Judge Bork the candidates can be for those social goals But it is a tight line to walk especially for Senator Biden As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and an eloquent opponent of the Bork nomination he has become closely identified with the confirmation battle and will be even more so when the public hearings begin next week with him in the chair His first primary comes early a party strategist said of Senator Biden recently He faces an earlier test than anyone else The Senators risk is shared to some degree by the rest of the Democratic field The fight against Judge Bork could link the party in the mind of the electorate with those uncomfortable social issues and the close ties to interest groups that many said helped to defeat Walter F Mondales in 1984 The Contras The subject of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels is made to order for the Democrats who to a person were working it hard even before the Irancontra committees began their public hearings The candidates who are members of Congress emphasize that they never voted for aid to the contras the current and former Governors in the race make the point that they opposed letting their National Guards participate in training exercises in Honduras the neighboring country from which the contras stage many of their guerrilla operations On money for the rebels the Republican candidates all call for aid to continue while the Central American peace process inches forward But their support for the contras is not extended to the Administrations secret dealings on the rebels behalf Former Secretary of State Haig is particularly thunderous Covert action he says is never a substitute for a coherent foreign policy Sailing to a different wind Mr Robertson branded the Congressional hearings unconstitutional AIDS Everyone in both parties is for more research than would be possible with the 417 million authorized for it by the Federal Government this year But they disagree to some degree on education and to a large degree on testing All in all the issue is more of a problem for the Republicans than the Democrats Candidates with large conservative constituencies are uncomfortable with some Reagan Administration officials educational approach preaching chastity and monogamy seems more appropriate to them than teaching about safe sex And candidates near the center find the Administration insufficiently sensitive to privacy questions in its call for testing people to see if they are carriers of the AIDS virus AIDS is one of the few issues on which Vice President Bush has taken a somewhat different position from that of President Reagan They both call for widespread testing  of immigrants prisoners aliens seeking permanent resident status people applying for marriage licenses But Mr Bush also stresses confidentiality which the White House does not Senator Dole spoke out earlier He urges caution in AIDS testing concerned not only about privacy but also about the reliability of the tests he has called for spending several billion dollars on research The Persian Gulf The reflagging of the oil tankers is a big issue for Senator Gore who is using it to make the point that he is more centrist and therefore more capable than other Democrats of capturing many moderate voters in the early Southern primaries It would have discredited the United States he says to have turned down the Kuwaiti request that 11 of their oil tankers protectively carry the American flag The other Democrats are more critical calling for a compromise international approach As for the Republicans Senator Dole is more cautious and questioning than the others but is outdone by former Secretary of State Haig who calls the Administration policy strategic confusion
CENTRAL AMERICAN PLIGHT IS PEOPLE IN ABUNDANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/world/central-american-plight-is-people-in-abundance.html,As one of 17 children of a sharecropper Juan Francisco Chita was forced to go to work in the fields at the age of 9 Now 37 he cannot read or write but because he is determined to be able to own a piece of land and give his children a better life he and his wife Reina have tried to limit the size of their own family With only five children my belt is already stretched as tight as it can go said Mr Chita who ekes out a living hauling produce in an oxcart and cultivating a small patch of corn near Azacualpa in the fertile but heavily populated farmland of western El Salvador I cant imagine what it would be like trying to raise a family as big as my parents these days Socorro Cisneros de Rosales knows only too well what it is like A 33yearold resident of Barrio Grenada a Managua slum Mrs Rosales has 13 children ranging from 19yearold Sonia to 3monthold Rudy and is struggling desperately with her 59yearold husband Ernesto to make ends meet We used to say that what abounded in Nicaragua were children and food she said as she sat holding Sonias own 9monthold infant her first grandchild in the oneroom wooden shack with a dirt floor that is home to her family and three squealing piglets Nowadays what we have is an overproduction of children and a lack of food and work A Negative Influence It is often argued that the origins of the crisis in Central America are not so much political as social If that is so then the experience of Mr Chita Mrs Rosales and millions of people like them seems to indicate that a rapidly growing population is a fundamental source of the regions turmoil intimately linked to the problems of health housing education nutrition and land use The population growth rate in Central America is one of the highest in the world and that can only be seen as a negative influence on development efforts said Roberto Santizo Galvez executive director of the Association for the Welfare of the Family a family planning organization in Guatemala Demographic factors are tremendously important and they will continue to play a major role not only in our social economic and political situation but also in the generation of violence The Population Doubles According to the Latin American Demographic Center a branch of the United Nations the population of the Central American countries of Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Nicaragua now exceeds 27 million more than double the figure of 25 years ago Despite the civil wars and mass migrations that have erupted over the last decade the population of the region Panama is traditionally considered separately is projected to rise to nearly 40 million by the turn of the century even though the actual birth rate is declining A variety of private and Governmentsupported family planning programs exist throughout the region including one in El Salvador that the State Department has praised as one of the most progressive in the hemisphere But widespread political opposition has weakened many such efforts In contrast to the 30year period ending in 1980 which saw a doubling of per capita income in the region after allowing for inflation the current population spurt is occurring at a time of economic crisis and austerity programs Every country in the region has had at least one year of negative economic growth in the last five which means that more people have to share less For any country it is worrying when the increase of population goes above the economic growth rate Costa Ricas Deputy Minister of Planning Sandra Piszk said in an interview in San Jose The signs of that population explosion are visible throughout Central America in the pregnant women dressed in the olivegreen uniform of the Sandinista Army who stand along Nicaraguan roadsides in the beggar children of Honduras in the condomdispensing machines in gas stations throughout El Salvador and in the Indian women nursing rosycheeked babies as they sell vegetables at markets in the highlands of Guatemala El Salvador the most densely populated country in the Western Hemisphere averages more than 670 people per square mile 56 million people crowded into an area smaller than New Hampshire Both Honduras the poorest country in the region and Nicaragua have birth rates of over 40 per thousand more than double the rate in the United States The Vicious Circle Other Problems Wait Such population growth say demographers diplomats international relief and health workers and other specialists complicates relations between neighboring countries influences ties among social classes and ethnic groups and colors dealings between church and state But most of all they say it impedes Government efforts to resolve other pressing social problems No one argues that population growth is the only factor that prevents development said a demographer at an international organization based in Costa Rica But people need to understand that there is a continuous interrelation Economic conditions affect the birth rate which affects the economy and on and on in a vicious circle The cycle is most evident in the countryside which still provides the livelihood for the bulk of the regions population In many areas peasant women average seven to eight births It seems like you are still nursing one baby when another one is on the way said Ninfa Rosa Nolasco de Gomez a 45yearold mother of 10 who lives on the Tenacious Success farm cooperative near Comayagua Honduras There are practical economic reasons for that high level of fertility principally the conviction that the more hands available to work the fields the more the income of the household Every child comes with his bread underneath his arm says a popular Salvadoran peasant proverb On the other hand a large family can stand in the way of a higher standard of living and undercut efforts to distribute resources more equitably In some areas most notably El Salvador where cornfields and banana and papaya plantings run up to the very edge of highways to take advantage of every foot of land high population density has even raised questions about the viability of land redistribution If peasants receive individual plots or join cooperatives too small to support their families misery in the countryside could increase Simply to decree a land reform would one of the stupidest things we of the left could do Ruben Zamora a member of the executive committee of the Democratic Revolutionary Front the political arm of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement acknowledged in an interview in Managua You have to provide alternatives for that mass of people living in the countryside For many life in the city is seen as the best alternative Indeed one of the most striking phenomena of the last decade accelerated by widespread fighting in the countryside is the urbanization of the region as unneeded younger sons and daughters flock to the cities in search of factory or service jobs that often prove elusive Because of such internal migration Guatemala City the largest metropolis in the region is now estimated to have 18 million inhabitants and San Salvador more than one million Managua its population swelled by refugees and low crop prices fixed by the Government counts more than a million residents too The city which never rebuilt its central districts after the 1972 earthquake anticipates having to house and feed two million by the end of the century Public services already strained by war and natural disasters such as earthquakes simply cannot cope officials say In Guatemala City disputes over access to water have erupted and schools in San Salvador are operating three shifts a day The Government cant build enough schools to keep up said an American official in El Salvador It can only hope to serve the public at the 1979 prewar level In its 1987 Economic Plan the Nicaraguan Government noted The rhythm of population growth is more rapid than the states capacity to build housing units Each year there is an average increase of 16000 families and the states construction capacity is only 7000 housing units a year The solution to Managuas problem the report concluded is to undertake actions to retain population in the countryside Nicaraguas overall population density is relatively low for the region the eastern half of the country has only 7 percent of the population The influx into the cities not only forces families into precarious living conditions Population pressures also distort the labor market and mean that when work is available it is often at a low wage There are thousands of people arriving in the city looking for jobs and that makes the crisis all the greater said Danilo Rivera a 30yearold bricklayer who lives in Tegucigalpa the Honduran capital in a hillside squatter settlement known as the Goat Colony The boss knows and I do too that if I dont want to work at the salary hes offering he can always find someone else who will Mr Rivera who has a wife and one child with another on the way said he had come from the countryside six years ago because he felt he had no future as a farmer Though his father owns 20 acres of land Mr Rivera has six brothers and sisters and he believes to divide up the land among all the children would lower efficiency and increase dependence on outside credit It wouldnt be anything he said of the three acres he had expected to receive The harvest of coffee corn and beans youd get wouldnt be enough to carry you through to the next year And if youre looking for good land to grow vegetables you dont find it only mountains and forests The Search for Limits Many Are Opposed To some extent emigration to the United States has served in recent years as a safety valve for population pressures Nearly a million Central Americans mostly Salvadorans and Nicaraguans are estimated to live in the United States and an additional halfmillion have moved to neighboring countries in the region as political refugees or for economic reasons Efforts to limit the population explosion both private and governmental have been hampered by the fact that the issue has become a political one that rouses opposition among groups from the far right to the far left The military often takes a nationalist position arguing that more people are needed to settle unpopulated areas and defend the nation while the oligarchy wants to preserve its privileges Ive had Honduran hacienda owners ask me where they are going to get their maids and who is going to pick their coffee and bananas if the population growth rate goes down said an American official whose experience in the region goes back to the 1960s The Roman Catholic Church traditionally a major political force also actively resists family planning efforts Governments be they revolutionary like the Sandinistas of Nicaragua or Christian Democratic like those of Guatemala and El Salvador are often reluctant to complicate their relations with the church by pressing the issue aggressively Though sterilization is widely practiced overwhelmingly by women abortion is illegal in every country in the region except Nicaragua where it is permitted if the mothers life is threatened Church teachings on contraception are widely heeded especially among the poor whose only source of contact with the outside world is often the parish priest It is a sin to plan said Maria Antonia Roque de Maravilla a 40yearold Salvadoran mother of six who says she plans to have more children even though her husband earns only 55 a month and the war in the countryside has displaced her family from its home in Usulutan Province The Lord sends the children to you and you must accept however many you receive Life may be hard but that is Gods will The church has been especially active in Guatemala where it is involved in a continuing campaign to woo women away from family planning clinics especially among the conservative Indian peasant population of the highlands Clerics and lay people have also lobbied the Reagan Administration calling for an end to American aid to family planning programs which is channeled through the Agency for International Development But opposition also comes from the other end of the ideological spectrum The left argues that Central Americas problem is not one of overpopulation but distribution and that the crisis would be solved if there were only a more just and equitable division of land wealth and other resources We do not believe in indiscriminate birth control said an official at the Nicaraguan Health Ministry You do not end poverty by destroying the poor In El Salvador the situation is already so grave that the new Constitution adopted in 1984 obliges the Government to adopt population policies with the objective of assuring the greatest wellbeing to the inhabitants of the republic Marcos Revelo the monsignor of Santa Ana El Salvador blessed a family planning clinic when it opened recently and the rebels seeking the overthrow of the Government also acknowledge the severity of the problem Any government in El Salvador has to have an intelligent demographic policy Mr Zamora the rebel leader said Without that there can be no development For most of this century El Salvador was able to export its surplus population to neighboring Honduras where work and land were more readily available But by 1969 more than 10 percent of the Honduran population was composed of Salvadorans a situation that led to the outbreak of the socalled Soccer War between the two countries and the breakdown of the Central American Common Market That was a demographic war and if people arent careful there is going to be another one an American official said The Ominous Outlook Still More Pressures Despite the decline in birth rates everything indicates that demographic pressures in the region are going to increase further before they ease The InterAmerican Development Bank noted in a report last year All the persons who will be looking for jobs by the end of the 20th century have already been born In fact a majority of Central Americas population is under 21 years of age and clearly dissatisfied with living conditions For governments struggling to keep their heads above water as they deal with insurgencies that augurs ill for the future One of the principal contributing causes if not the root cause of the violence and despair you see has to do with those kids who were born into a situation in which they havent got a shred of hope of economic viability said an American official who has spent most of his career in the region They are unwanted unneeded kids from the day they are born and it only gets worse for them At the moment the peace plan signed by the Presidents of five Central American countries in Guatemala on Aug 7 has raised hopes that a solution to the regions political crisis may finally be in sight But those accustomed to taking a broader and more longterm view of events warn against assuming that a panacea exists Even if we obtain peace tomorrow the changes we need will not take place overnight a demographer based in Costa Rica said The changes are going to have to be done slowly and gradually through a process of education and economic and social achievements that will require decades They cant be done by decree NEXT Land redistribution
"In Kenya, Back-Alley Abortions Are Thriving",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/opinion/l-in-kenya-back-alley-abortions-are-thriving-632587.html,To the Editor How RighttoLifers Promote Abortion editorial Aug 15 which tells how the Reagan Administrations withholding of funds for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities keeps Africas hospital beds filled with victims of botched abortions  was right on target I returned to the United States a year ago after having worked six months in a mission hospital in Kenya Abortion is illegal in Kenya but it is widely practiced because the fertility rate is the highest in the world and because family planning services though promoted by UNFPA activities are not universally available and are often thwarted by husbands and other men in an extremely maledominated society Before my experience in Africa I had never witnessed the results of a backalley abortion but there the consequences were commonplace On my second night on duty I was summoned to attend a 23yearold woman whose condition had changed I arrived to find her dead from an overwhelming infection the result of an illegal abortion Earlier that day while doing everything possible to save her I saw her cervix which looked like hamburger Hers was not an isolated case Perhaps the cruelest and most devastating legacy of this Administration will result from policies like withholding contributions to the UNFPA These contributions should be increased to make familyplanning services more available The socalled righttolifers are seeing to it with the Administrations backing that the illegal unsafe abortion industry in places like Kenya continues to thrive Their apparent goal is to insure that life in overpopulated countries like Kenya be nasty brutish and short RANDY ROCKNEY MD Cumberland RI Aug 18 1987
Marshall Puts Reagan at 'Bottom' Among Presidents on Civil Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/us/marshall-puts-reagan-at-bottom-among-presidents-on-civil-rights.html,Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court in a highly unusual public criticism of a sitting President has said in a television interview that Ronald Reagan ranked at the bottom of United States Presidents in terms of the rights of blacks In the interview to be broadcast Sunday Justice Marshall said of Mr Reagan Honestly I think hes down with Hoover and that group Wilson When we really didnt have a chance The word we was a reference to blacks Justice Marshall confirmed today that he made the remarks in an interview with the columnist Carl T Rowan But he did not elaborate on his criticism of Mr Reagan The 79yearold Justice once a leading civil rights lawyer is the only black ever to sit on the Supreme Court In his Supreme Court opinions he has sharply differed with the Administrations positions on civil rights and other issues A White House spokesman said there would be no immediate comment regarding his comments In another interview on the same program the woman whose challenge to a Texas law prohibiting abortion led to the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade now says she lied when she said that a rape was the cause of her pregnancy [ Page A23 ] No sitting member of the Supreme Court in recent memory has publicly criticized a sitting President in comments off the bench In his interviews with Mr Rowan Justice Marshall also gave unflattering assessments of Presidents Roosevelt Eisenhower and Kennedy on racial issues while praising President Truman as well as President Johnson who named him to the Court in 1967 The interviews were recorded in recent months and portions are to be broadcast Sunday by WUSA Channel 9 in Washington and other stations affiliated with the Gannett news organization as part of a program on the Constitution called Searching for Justice Three American Stories The station released a partial transcript today In a telephone interview this evening Justice Marshall said that as far as he recalled his interview with Mr Rowan was the first formal news interview he had given since he was named to the Court Treatment of Blacks In the telephone interview Justice Marshall chuckled at times as a reporter read back to him parts of the transcript apparently amused by the interest his comments had aroused But he said Im not going to elaborate on anything He also declined to comment on the pending nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court Judge Bork who has a conservative judicial philosophy has criticized many Supreme Court decisions in which Justice Marshall has joined In his interview with Mr Rowan Justice Marshall spoke bitterly at times of the treatment of blacks throughout American history including the present The biggest thing we brag about in this country on the ethical side is that its the great melting pot Justice Marshall said As I sit and look at it now at this late date I have come to the definite conclusion that if the United States is indeed the great melting pot the Negro either didnt get in the pot or he didnt get melted down In a speech in May he denounced the perpetuation of slavery and other actions by the framers of the Constitution But in the interview with Mr Rowan he said that with the addition of the postCivil War amendments extending rights to blacks youll never find a better Constitution than this one Johnsons Plans Unbelievable Asked by Mr Rowan to rate some of the Presidents and their impact on racial justice in his lifetime Justice Marshall said I dont think Roosevelt did much for the Negro But I think Truman is going to come out on top Eisenhower I dont think did anything except to try to undermine the school decision  which he did Kennedy was held back by the Attorney General his brother His brother said dont do anything for the Negroes because you wont get reelected  wait until youre reelected and then do it And then he got killed But Johnson his plans were unbelievable the things he was going to do But he was too far out for Negroes and civil rights He wasnt thrown out because of Vietnam they just used that as an excuse to get rid of him In response to a question from Mr Rowan he said he considered Johnson the greatest President in terms of civil rights Of President Carter he said I think his heart was in the right place But thats the best I can do with him Exchange About Reagan There followed this exchange Mr Rowan What about Ronald Reagan Justice Marshall The bottom Mr Rowan The bottom Justice Marshall Honestly I think hes down with Hoover and that group Wilson When we really didnt have a chance Mr Rowan Yet hes been one of the most popular Presidents the country ever had in the polls Justice Marshall Is he more popular than the average movie star Justice Marshall also discussed a case in which as a lawyer he had won a court decree forcing the admission of a black man to the University of Maryland Law School Well number one they wouldnt let me go to the law school because I was a Negro and all through law school I decided Id make them pay for it and so when I got out and passed the bar I proceeded to make them pay for it Asked by Mr Rowan whether this has been sweet revenge the Justice said Wonderful I enjoyed it to no end Suspicion About Nixon Justice Marshall also told Mr Rowan that when he was ill with pneumonia at the Bethesda Naval Hospital years ago President Nixon had sought a report on his condition an interest that Justice Marshall suspected grew out of an eagerness on the part of Mr Nixon to have a vacancy to fill on the Court He said he had told a Navy officer at the time Well Admiral you have my permission to give it to him only on one condition that you put at the bottom of it quote Not Yet  Mr Nixon could not be reached for comment this evening In more recent years Justice Marshall has said emphatically that he had no plans to retire as long as his health permitted and he has reportedly told friends that he would remain on the Court as long as he could rather than create a vacancy for Mr Reagan to fill Justice Marshall who has had serious health problems over the years and was hospitalized for several days this summer with a potentially dangerous blood clot in his foot said in the telephone interview this evening that his present health was good
U.S. Judge Blocks a Georgia Law That Limits Abortions for Minors,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/us/us-judge-blocks-a-georgia-law-that-limits-abortions-for-minors.html,A Federal judge barred Georgia today from enforcing a new law that required minors to notify their parents before having abortions The judge ruled that two provisions of the law were unconstitutional but he suggested ways for the problems to be resolved It was the second ruling in a week in the Federal courts involving parental notification of abortions Last week a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit struck down a 1981 Minnesota law requiring minors to notify both parents or receive a courts permission before getting abortions In the Georgia case Federal District Judge Robert Hall ordered a stay of further proceedings until the United States Supreme Court ruled on a similar law in Illinois The Georgia law passed by the Legislature earlier this year would have required a parent or other adult to accompany a girl 17 years old or younger to an abortion clinic to verify that her parents had been informed Clinics performing abortions without proof of parental notification would have been guilty of a misdemeanor Increased Costs Cited The law was to take effect July 1 but Judge Hall issued a temporary restraining order blocking it after Planned Parenthood chapters in Atlanta and Augusta filed a suit challenging it At a hearing before the judge in July opponents argued that the law would cause delays increasing the health risk and costs of abortion Proponents of the law argued that it would bring families closer together at a critical time in a young womans life In his ruling Tuesday Judge Hall said the requirement that an adult accompany a girl to a clinic was unconstitutional because it unduly burdens the minors rights No matter how thoroughly discussed and well considered the decision to terminate a pregnancy may be he said a family acting on goodfath compliance with the statute may not be able to implement that decision without unnecessary costly and medically dangerous delay and expense Telephone or Mail The judge said legislators could solve that problem by amending the law to allow verification of parental notification by telephone or mail which is allowed in other states He also said the law was an unconstitutional violation of a juveniles right to anonymity He noted that while the law would allow a judge to approve a girls abortion as an alternative to parental notification in some cases the rules of the Georgia Supreme Court did not provide for the sealing of juvenile court documents The judge said the problem could easily be resolved by the State Supreme Court Planned Parenthood officials were pleased with the ruling said Kay Scott executive director of the groups Atlanta chapter She said the judge affirmed the minors right to privacy and our contentions that the law is abusive Michael Bowers the Georgia Attorney General said state officials had not decided whether to appeal

"FOR CATHOLICS, A CHANCE TO RAISE ISSUES WITH POPE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/us/for-catholics-a-chance-to-raise-issues-with-pope.html,In his effort to reassert the orthodoxies of the Roman Catholic Church in a clear and forceful manner Pope John Paul II has made his views known on most of the issues that have been roiling for years inside the American church But that does not deter many of the groups who await his 10day visit that starts Thursday We believe essentially that the church can change and the Pope can change and that the Pope will be open to ideas if we can get his attention said Sister Jeanine Grammick a member of the board of the Coalition of American Nuns who has been urging the church to ordain women as priests If you take the long historical view you realize that the church has changed over the centuries but it takes a long time Women priests homosexuals blacks Hispanic people and other distinct groups of Catholics are planning to use this visit to let the Pope know what is on their minds either through demonstrations or through nuances in prepared statements they will be making directly to him Turmoil Within the Church The messages they plan to deliver reflect the turmoil within the broader American church as large numbers of Americas 52 million Catholics disagree with their churchs stands on birth control homosexuality and the ordination of women among other issues In addition several minorities within the church such as black and Hispanic Catholics feel the church needs to be more sensitive to their cultures and give them a larger voice The Pope is certainly aware of such grievances but the groups see the visit as a special opportunity to dramatize their message We dont have access to the Pope and we are using the occasion of his visit to raise these issues publicly so hopefully he will hear about them said Sister Jeanine Not only do we hope he listens to our message but we hope these issues will be discussed by people generally Debated Status of Women The status of women in the church is one of the most widely debated issues among American Catholics A sizable number of American Catholic women perhaps a majority say they are displeased that women are excluded from authority roles The church believes that Jesus whose apostles were men reserved the priesthood for men Some 30 groups of women have already held a series of demonstrations in Washington More will be held along the ninecity papal route Womens ordination is the crux of a lot of issues said Sister Jeanine We cant be in decisionmaking in the church because thats closed to you As a result of exclusion from the priesthood argues Mary E Hunt a theologian who is codirector of Womens Alliance for Theology Ethics and Ritual the experience of women cannot be brought to bear on the churchs positions on abortion birth control and surrogate mothering all of which the church opposes Issue of Homosexuality Many homosexuals have been disturbed by a Vatican document last year that urged withdrawal of support from groups condoning homosexual activity In the aftermath bishops in a number of dioceses including New York ended the periodic masses that had been celebrated by Dignity a nationwide group that does not agree with the churchs stand forbidding homosexual activity The Pope may not directly address the issue of homosexuality But about 100 AIDS patients or their relatives have been invited to attend a church service in San Francisco The Pope said Russell Shaw a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholics Bishops will probably say something about the necessity for a compassionate response towards people who suffer from the disease Nevertheless Dignity will be marking its protest with quiet prayer vigils away from the papal sites They will know we are there said Jim Bussen Dignitys president We view ourselves as faithful sons and daughters of the church and we view ourselves as voices that are hurting and that need to be heard The nations priests will have a chance to tell the Pope directly about their concerns when he meets with them in St Marthas Church in Miami The Pope however will not be caught by surprise since rules of what are called structured dialogue require a prior submission of the statement so the Pope can prepare a response The Shortage of Priests The Rev Frank J McNulty vicar for priests in the Diocese of Newark who has been chosen to represent the nations 55000 priests at the ceremony said that a primary concern was the shortage of priests It has created a morale problem he said particularly in remote areas where he added that there was more loneliness and less backup from nearby priests It stretches the priests sometimes to the limit in meeting the expectations of people and living up to his own expectations of what he should do It puzzles us now as to how many young people dont want to be priests because so many of us love the priesthood and enjoy doing it he said Father McNulty believes fewer young men want to make the permanent commitment that priestly vows entail particularly the sacrificial commitment of celibacy in a society that stresses intimate relationships Mr Shaw doubts that the Pope will diagnose the reasons for the priest shortage or suggest solutions Rather he said I think he will try to urge men who are priests now to appreciate their vocation and if you will radiate that satisfaction so that it will tend to generate new vocations to the priesthood Hispanic Catholic Concerns In San Antonio Los Angeles and Miami the Pope will be seen by large numbers of Hispanic Catholics The Rev Vincente O Lopez associate director for Hispanic Affairs of the national bishops conference says a primary concern is the success Pentecostals Evangelicals and other Christian groups are having in proselytizing among the nations 17 million Hispanic Catholics Hispanic people he said are drawn to these faiths by their spiritual fervor and intimate congregations and by their offering the poor or immigrants assistance on everything from plumbing to jobs They are welcoming to the Hispanic who does not feel comfortable in the anonymous churches that most of our large parishes work out of he said The American church he said has been expert at assimilating people but Hispanic people are different from earlier immigrant groups because they retain ties to the Latin cultures south of the border Too few Catholic schools he complained have bilingual programs Too few priests speak Spanish and so the faith hasnt been given over to the young he said Dominant Issue for Blacks Ethnic sensitivity is also a dominant issue for the nations 13 million black Catholics James P Lyke of Cleveland an Auxiliary Bishop says blacks are trying to win acceptance of their traditions including hymns borrowed from black Baptists and a more emotional worship style that may break out into swaying and hand clapping Other concerns of black Catholics include a desire for more black priests and bishops Among the 11 black bishops there is only one Bishop Joseph L Howze of Biloxi Miss who heads his own diocese Black Catholic leaders also want the church to sustain aging Catholic schools in black neighborhoods These schools they contend stress discipline and basic skills and are more effective than public schools in teaching black children
Key Abortion Plaintiff Now Denies She Was Raped,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/us/key-abortion-plaintiff-now-denies-she-was-raped.html,The woman whose challenge to a state law virtually prohibiting abortion led to the Supreme Courts landmark Roe v Wade decision now says she lied when she declared upon bringing suit that it was rape that had caused her pregnancy The assertion of rape was not a factor in the Supreme Courts ruling which established a womans constitutional right to an abortion a decision that has stirred emotional debate ever since it was handed down 14 years ago The disclosure by Norma McCorvey the Jane Roe in Roe v Wade came in an interview with the syndicated newspaper columnist Carl T Rowan The interview conducted in June in Dallas Ms McCorveys hometown is part of a television documentary that will be broadcast Sunday by station WUSA here which issued a transcript today Ms McCorvey told Mr Rowan that she had fabricated her account of being raped by three men and a woman in 1969 because she had hoped to circumvent a 100yearold Texas law that banned abortions except when the womans life was in danger What I Thought Was Love Ms McCorvey said that she had actually become pregnant through what I thought was love and that she decided to challenge the state law when her doctor told her that she could not legally have an abortion in Texas In 1970 her lawyers filed a Federal suit against Henry Wade the Dallas County District Attorney The suit protecting her anonymity by identifying her as Jane Roe was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court which in legalizing abortion on Jan 22 1973 cited the 14th Amendments privacy protections The transcript of the interview does not make clear why Ms McCorvey thought that an account of rape would necessarily help win exemption from or overturn a law that allowed abortion only to protect a womans life Ms McCorvey now a 39yearold apartment house manager in Dallas has an unlisted telephone number there and could not be reached for comment tonight However Mr Rowan reached at his Washington home said She told me that she thought she would win so much public support by claiming that she was gang raped that she might get an exception from the Texas law Mr Rowan said that when he approached Ms McCorvey about the possibility of interviewing her he had no notion that she would make so startling a disclosure I frankly was flabbergasted he said As for why Ms McCorvey would make the disclosure now after 17 years Mr Rowan said she had told a producer for the program that she had been swayed by Mr Rowans gentle and concerned manner 21 at the Time Ms McCorvey was 21 years old when she became pregnant At the time she was working as a waitress and she told Mr Rowan was too poor to travel to California the closest state where abortion was legal or to afford local illegal abortionists I was very depressed she said How dare them tell me that I couldnt abort a baby that I did not want Unable to have an abortion in Texas or travel to another state she said she grew bitter very bitter and in her anger fabricated the rape story Meanwhile with the legal challenge pending Ms McCorvey brought the baby to term and put it up for adoption According to news reports she never again saw the baby Lawyers Response According to a news release issued by WUSA about the interview Sarah Weddington one of the two lawyers who took the case to the Supreme Court said she had never touched the issue of rape and only emphasized the question of whether the Constitution gives to the state or leaves to a woman the questions of what she can or must do with her body Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said in an interview today that Ms McCorveys disclosure should not cloud the discussion about the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy If she lied you have to remember that abortions were illegal Ms Michelman said and that women were looked down upon if they were pregnant outside of marriage It was her life circumstances that created the conditions that mitigated against her being straightforward about the fact that she was pregnant and wanted to terminate that pregnancy After the celebrated Supreme Court decision Ms McCorvey at first lived in relative obscurity in Dallas fearing that she would become a target of antiabortion activists In recent years however she has become active in abortion rights and feminist groups Last month for example she appeared at a rally sponsored by the National Organization for Women denouncing President Reagans Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H Bork
"THE PAPAL VISIT; Catholics, in Poll, Admire Pope but Disagree",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/10/us/the-papal-visit-catholics-in-poll-admire-pope-but-disagree.html,Most of Americas Roman Catholics hold a favorable view of Pope John Paul II although even larger majorities of them disagree with him on birth control ordaining women as priests divorce and several other widely debated issues The New York TimesCBS News Poll has found The Pope arrives in Miami today for a 10day visit to the United States that officials have said is intended to help Americas 52 million Catholics reaffirm their commitment to Catholic tradition and to their essential unity with the Pope American Catholics are dusting cobwebs off their Catholic identity and renewing their religious commitment Archbishop John L May said yesterday in Miami where John Paul arrives at 2 oclock this afternoon to spend his first day in this country talking with a group of American priests and meeting President and Nancy Reagan Poll Discerns Differences But Archbishop May the president of the National Conference of Bishops implicitly took note of the doctrinal differences among American Catholics There is some fuzziness some confusion about what the church really teaches he said and some fuzziness as to what Catholics really believe Judging from The TimesCBS News Poll the Pope may encounter some important beliefs that vary from church teaching as he travels from Miami to South Carolina New Orleans San Antonio and Phoenix then stops in three cities on the West Coast before swinging north to Detroit and the Canadian Northwest But he will also encounter enormous personal affection and respect Not Just a Catholic Spokesman Of the 605 Catholics polled by telephone from Aug 16 through Aug 22 59 percent said they had a favorable opinion of John Paul II and only 5 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion The margin of sampling error for these findings is plus or minus four percentage points The intensity of feeling was evidenced by the the fact that 56 percent agreed with the idea that Pope John Paul is a moral and humanitarian spokesman for all people no matter what their religion rather than simply a spokesman for the Catholic Church the opinion of 31 percent But his doctrinal difficulties appeared to be even broader than the disagreements on specific issues that have received overriding attention Almost half of American Catholics 48 percent say their church is out of touch with their needs while 43 percent expressed the opposite opinion Changing With the Times Moreover when asked if the church should change some of its teachings to better reflect the opinions of most Catholics today 58 percent said it should while 36 percent disagreed saying the church should continue to hold to its teachings regardless of what most Catholics think Younger and older Catholics differed sharply on many questions with those 50 and older much more likely to agree with the more conservative positions the Pope holds and those under 50 more inclined to liberal views on issues from sex to the ordination of women Despite its findings which paralleled earlier polls indicating major disagreements on issues relating to sex and to the clergy The TimesCBS News Poll suggested that the views of lay Catholics toward some of the tensions in recent years between the Vatican and the American church may be quite complicated and difficult to pigeonhole Most Catholics polled  61 percent said the Pope exerts about the right amount of control over the church in the United States with only 15 percent saying he exerts too much control and 16 percent saying he exerts too little If there was any sizable displeasure with the Vaticans disciplining last year of Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen for tolerating doctrinal differences in the Seattle Diocese it did not show up in the responses to that broad question Tolerating Deviant Theology However by 55 percent to 29 percent Catholics said the Vatican should not prevent priests who disagree with the churchs positions from teaching theology in Catholic universities Although far from definitive this finding suggests that a majority of Americas Catholics might have disagreed with the Vaticans decision to dismiss the Rev Charles E Curran as a theologian at the Catholic University of America for his dissenting views on sexual ethics On a more recent controversy the Popes audience with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria 31 percent said the Pope should have held the meeting and 14 percent said he should not have with 49 percent saying they did not have an opinion Among all the nonCatholics in the survey in which 1480 Americans in all were interviewed 21 percent approved of the meeting and 15 percent disapproved Some people have criticized the papal meeting with President Waldheim who served in World War II with a German Army unit that has been implicated in the deportation of Jews to death camps Among the 22 Jews in the TimesCBS News survey two people approved of the papal audience and 13 did not The Catholics polled maintained their favorable feelings toward the Pope even though 50 percent said the Pope was more conservative than they were on social and political issues and 47 percent said the Pope was more conservative than they were on issues of personal morality Issues of Personal Morality The poll measured several particular issues of personal morality  Of the Catholics surveyed 64 percent said they favored artifical methods of birth control which the Vatican has consistently opposed Only 27 percent agreed with the Vaticans opposition to birth control  By 66 percent to 27 percent the Catholics polled said they favored permitting Catholics to divorce and remarry The church believes that marriage is indissoluble though it will grant an annulment if prescribed flaws in the original marriage bond can be found  Opinion was evenly split on homosexuality 45 percent of the Catholics said they thought homosexual relations between consenting adults in their own homes should be legal while 43 percent thought not The church condemns homosexual practices though it regards homosexual inclination itself as morally neutral 56 Favor Women as Priests On several issues specific to their faith American Catholics dissent from Rome in large numbers Catholics favored the ordination of women as priests by 56 to 39 percent Over the past two decades the church has expanded the role of women in the church permitting them to read Scriptures at mass distribute communion and counsel engaged couples But it has opposed the ordination of women because the churchs theology holds that Jesus whose Apostles were men reserved the priesthood for men Most Would Limit Abortion On one issue however Catholics moved closer to their church and away from the American mainstream Only 29 percent of those polled said abortion should be as widely available under law as it is today This compares with the 40 percent of nonCatholics who held that view Moreover 61 percent of Catholics polled said they felt abortion was the equivalent of murdering a child  the church believes life begins at conception  as against 47 percent for nonCatholics THE NEW YORK TIMESCBS NEWS POLL ON BEING CATHOLIC All 1849 50 and Catholics years older Opinion of Pope John Paul II Favorable 59 54 69 Not favorable

older HOW THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Aug 16 through 22 with 1480 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences In order to reach a sufficiently large number of Roman Catholics to allow statistically sound comparisons among various categories of Catholics some interviewers terminated their calls whenever they reached nonCatholics so they could conduct more interviews with Catholics But results were then weighted to reflect the actual adult population of the nation by religion The results were also weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger for the 605 people who said their current religious preference was Catholic it is plus or minus four percentage points For Catholics 18 to 49 years old the statistical error is plus or minus five percentage points for Catholics 50 or over it is seven points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll THE POPE IN MIAMI 2 PM  Pope arrives in Miami 245 PM  Departure

"Life, Death and Fetal Tissue",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/11/opinion/life-death-and-fetal-tissue.html,Until 30 years ago replacing sick organs seemed the stuff of fiction So until nine years ago did conceiving a baby in a petri dish Now another medical marvel is on the horizon using fetal tissue to treat nerve disorders Because fetal tissue is adaptable and resistant to immunologial rejection researchers say it has immense potential for treating Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease Huntingtons chorea spinal cord injuries diabetes leukemia aplastic anemia and radiation sickness It also has immense potential for provoking controversy Abortion opponents fear that the medical use of fetal tissue will legitimize what is to them an abhorrent practice Prochoice activists fear that the demand for fetal tissue might be akin to the demand for babies  and equally exploitive of females If some women are willing to lease their wombs to women who cant have children they fear then some women would be equally willing to lease theirs for the production of fetal tissue It would be a shame if this controversy stood in the way of valuable medical advances since the objections can be met by applying familiar rules for the handling of human organs removed for transplant or research A Federal law bans the sale of human organs it could be readily amended to ban the sale of fetal tissue as well thus eliminating any possible financial incentive for pregnancy Other rules based on ideas suggested last year by a Federal Task Force on Organ Transplantation might be written to govern collection and use of fetal tissue easing anxieties of those concerned for prenatal life State legislatures and courts have responded thoughtfully to questions about life and death raised by other new medical advances The debate about this one with all its potential benefits can be conducted with similar compassion and similar sense
WASHINGTON TALK: FUND-RAISERS; Bork As a Bonanza,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/11/us/washington-talk-fund-raisers-bork-as-a-bonanza.html,As the fundraisers see it Judge Robert H Bork is the best thing to happen to them since the stormy tenure of James G Watt as Interior Secretary Because Judge Borks elevation to the Supreme Court could tip its ideological balance both liberal and conservative advocacy groups have high stakes in the confirmation fight that is headed for Senate hearings next week But at least in donations both sides are winning so far Its a fundraising bonanza said Eddie Mahe Jr a Republican consultant Theres been nobody to beat up No Goldwater no Nixon Ted Kennedy has become irrelevant you cant beat him up But with this nomination there is someone to beat up given the passions aroused by Judge Borks conservative stands on abortion civil rights womens issues school prayer and judicial restraint Bork does represent the prospective swing vote Mr Mahe said Either side can make the case that if they fail theres a clear and present danger Hot Issues Fundraisers in the capital usually seize hot issues upon which to base their mailed solicitations Often the most effective pitches are centered on figures like Lieut Col Oliver L North But his drawing power was limited because he was a shortlived public sensation and because of the small number of fundraising groups concerned with foreign policy issues Democratic and Republican directmail consultants alike say Mr Bork has caused the largest reawakening of donors since Mr Watt who resigned in 1983 Liberal groups raised money by portraying Mr Watt as seeking to ruin the nations public areas and he was also the target of numerous ethnic and minority groups that had been the butts of his jokes Conservatives in their pitches said he was a loyalist who was being victimized The Bork battle too pits liberals against conservatives which is extremely useful in raising money This is the equivalent of Jim Watt wanting to flood the Grand Canyon said Roger Craver a directmail consultant with five clients who oppose the Bork nomination There is not an issue area that Judge Borks nomination doesnt affect Millions on Both Sides Groups opposed to Judge Bork have probably raised 6 million for the fight against his nomination and may well collect 12 million before the battle is over Mr Craver said Bruce Eberle a Republican directmail consultant said supporters of Judge Bork could ultimately amass 10 million Some of the money is paying for television radio and newspaper advertisements Groups are also signing up new donors and raising funds that could be tapped long after Judge Borks confirmation hearings end Both the left and right will identify new supporters that will then help them on other issues other battles in years to come said Richard Viguerie who is handling mailings for a dozen groups that favor Judge Bork This is probably the strongest mailing conservatives have had in many years Richard A Delgaudio a consultant who developed solicitations on Judge Bork for the Legal Affairs Council a conservative legal aid group said This is a gold mine for both conservatives and liberals But Id give the edge to the left because theyre going to vilify Judge Bork They have what you call a bogeyman Groups that are raising money to promote Judge Bork include Concerned Women of America Moral Majority National Conservative Political Action Committee National Right to Life Committee Conservative Caucus and the American Conservative Union Among the opponents of Judge Bork soliciting funds are National Abortion Rights Action League Planned Parenthood Federation of America American Civil Liberties Union People for the American Way National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and National Organization for Women A Strong Response The response has been much stronger than anything weve ever had said Arthur J Kropp executive director of People for the American Way a legal rights group After a successful test mailing to 541000 nonmembers in July the group sent out 38 million more solicitations We wanted to raise 1 million but now it looks like closer to 2 million Mr Kropp said Organizations are competing to develop the most creative fundraising appeals Richard Mintz a spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League said the tone of his groups mailings and those on the other side were similar All they do is put an un in front of the word born  he said A July 14 solicitation from the league asked donors to enclose my most generous possible check to help NARAL massively organize Americas prochoice majority to save our right to choose abortion Three days later the American Coalition for Life sent out this appeal from its chairman Ray Allen I am asking a handful of my key supporters like you to make truly sacrificial gifts of 300 or 400 I urgently need every penny I can get to support the nomination of Judge Bork
THE PAPAL VISIT; Poll Shows Most Priests Want the Right to Marry,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/11/us/the-papal-visit-poll-shows-most-priests-want-the-right-to-marry.html,A majority of Americas Roman Catholics parish priests think they should be allowed to marry a New York TimesCBS News Poll shows The priests are evenly split on ordaining women as priests and on whether it is sometimes proper to counsel the use of artificial birth control The telephone survey of a random sample of the nations approximately 30000 parish priests was the first major effort in many years to measure their personal opinions It presented a portrait of Catholic clergy divided on many church teachings and policies but generally satisfied with their own roles and supportive of American church leadership Shortly before his visit to the United States Pope John Paul II was ranked by the priests as less effective than Pope John XXIII and almost half said that John Paul was more conservative on issues of personal morality than they were themselves Only 4 of the 855 priests polled from Aug 24 through Sept 1 said he was more liberal Support for US Bishops In contrast the priests supported the leadership of the American bishops on many key issues from the churchs efforts to persuade the Federal Government of its views on poverty to conflicts with the Vatican over disciplining Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle for what it considered liberal practices in the archdiocese And they were supportive of the church in general with more than threefourths saying they thought it was in touch with the needs of American Catholics They also appeared confident of their own roles Thirtyseven percent said they had found it harder to be a parish priest than they expected at seminary while 7 percent said it was easier Among those who found it harder changing social values and the demands on their time were the reasons most frequently given Even so 97 percent said yes when asked Would you encourage someone like yourself to become a parish priest today But substantial minorities of the priests differed with church positions on abortion and on divorce and remarriage although on these issues their views were closer to those of church authorities than to the opinions of American Catholics generally Reactions to Survey Although a handful of priests in the sample objected to the survey in general and many quarreled with the wording of particular questions far more of their reactions were enthusiastic and the overall response rate was high In all 855 were interviewed but 111 refused In 122 other parishes the priest in the sample was not reached and so no interview was held The survey found some sharp differences among parish priests based on age older priests expressed more traditional views Sharper differences emerged between the 21 percent of priests who classified themselves as politically liberal and the 14 percent who called themselves conservative While 55 percent of all priests favored allowing priests to marry and 35 percent were opposed 78 percent of the liberals favored allowing marriage but only 32 percent of the conservatives did For all priests the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points for liberals it was plus or minus seven points and for conservatives plus or minus nine points This was an issue where the priests views just about matched those of American Catholics polled earlier in August by The Times and CBS News In that survey of 605 Catholics 59 percent favored letting priests marry while 34 percent were opposed Where Priests and Parish Differ On other questions the differences between priest and parish were greater Where 78 percent of priests said the church was in touch with the needs of American Catholics and 13 percent said it was out of touch 43 percent of lay Catholics said it was in touch and 48 percent said it was not Priests divided equally 43 percent to 43 percent on whether women should be ordained as priests But the laity supported ordaining women by 56 percent to 39 percent And while 28 percent of priests said they favored permitting Catholics to get divorced and marry someone else 66 percent of all Catholics supported that idea Similarly while 24 percent of priests said they personally favored the use of artificial methods of birth control 64 percent of all American Catholics favored such use But when the priests were asked Do you think there are circumstances in which priests should counsel Catholics to use artificial birth control 47 percent said there were and 45 percent said there were not Sixtythree percent of the priests who called themselves liberal said there were such circumstances but so did 27 percent of the conservatives Little Impact of Views Seen Finally the priests conceded that their views were of little impact Only 8 percent said married couples in their parish generally ask for religious advice on birth control while 83 percent said couples made their own decision Twentytwo percent of the priests said they thought most married couples in their parish used artificial birth control and 31 percent said some did There were also conflicts on the issue of abortion where the churchs teachings are more insistently pressed than they are on birth control First 85 percent of the priests said they thought the church should try to persuade the Federal Government to adopt its views on abortion Only 38 percent of Catholics generally favored such persuasion And 75 percent of priests compared with 27 percent of Catholics generally said lay Catholic officeholders should try to get laws passed to prohibit anyone from having an abortion But while the churchs position is to oppose abortion even to save the life of a mother or in cases of rape or incest 31 percent of priests like 48 percent of Catholics generally said such abortions should be legal And 3 percent of priests along with 29 percent of Catholics generally said abortions should be generally legal Finally 57 percent of priests said someone could disagree with the church that having an abortion is a sin and still be a good Catholic Among Catholics generally 84 percent stated that view The priests support for their bishops was shown not only in their support for efforts to persuade the Federal Government to adopt church positions on poverty and abortion but also on the Hunthausen issue Hunthausen and Curran Cases Fifty percent of the priests said they disapproved of the disciplining of Archbishop Hunthausen by the Vatican while 39 percent approved Eightyeight percent however said they approved of the restoration of his authority which was accomplished by a committee of American bishops On another case involving dissenting views on sexual issues the ouster of the Rev Charles E Curran from the teaching theology at Catholic University where the theology department is chartered by the Vatican 61 percent approved and 32 percent disapproved The priests were also asked more generally about the Popes influence on the church in America Twentytwo percent of the priests  and 49 percent of the liberal priests  said they thought the Pope was exerting too much control over the Catholic Church in the United States Eight percent said he was exerting too little control and 65 percent said he was exerting the right amount of control They were asked to compare him to other recent Popes on two measures doing the most to improve the image of the Roman Catholic Church among nonCatholics and doing the most for Catholics themselves Comparison of Popes On the Catholic image 63 percent said Pope John XXIII had done the most 27 percent chose Pope John Paul II 4 percent chose Pope Paul VI and 1 percent chose Pope Pius XII On doing the most for Catholics the differences were smaller Thirtyfive percent picked Pope John XXIII 25 percent Pope John Paul II 24 percent Pope Paul VI and 5 percent Pope Pius XII THE NEW YORK TIMESCBS NEWS POLL US CATHOLIC PRIESTS

on telephone interviews conducted Aug 24 through Sept 1 with 855 Roman Catholic parish priests around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii A sample of parishes was selected from the complete list of parishes in The Official Catholic Directory 1987 published by P J Kenedy  Sons Within each region the parishes were selected according to the number of priests residing at the parish and then one priest was randomly selected to be interviewed This method gave each parish priest in the nation an equal chance of being in the sample The results were then weighted to adjust for any differences in response rate by region In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all parish priests The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example for priests who say they are politically liberal it is plus or minus 7 percentage points In addition to sampling

TV's Double Standard on Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/opinion/tv-s-double-standard-on-sex.html,Last spring as part of a fiveyear state campaign to curb unplanned pregnancies and abortions health professionals started knocking on the doors of New York Citys commercial television stations They wanted to buy time for a commercial urging people to practice birth control  from saying no to taking the pill The consortium sad to say is still knocking At one station the problem is fairness If you take a topic to people with opposing points of view and cover both sides of the issue you are in control an executive reasoned If you allow paid advertisements you are giving the loudest voice to the people with the most money But this advertisement which is similar in content to those accepted by The Times and other newspapers represents a broad spectrum of approaches to birth control including abstinence At other stations the issue is taste This [ birth control ] is an issue involving intimate personal behavior the sort of subject matter that some portion of our audience would consider intrusive into their moral or religious beliefs a spokesman for one station said Even so each of these stations takes ads warning about AIDS The stations explain that the overwhelming nature of the AIDS epidemic justifies a sacrifice of taste But New York has an overwhelming outbreak of unplanned pregnancies too or it wouldnt have the thirdhighest abortion rate nearly 150000 a year in the country Meanwhile as TV says no to birth control in commercials it continues to sound a fervent yes to sex  on soaps sitcoms and dramatic series not to mention advertising for commercial products The spirit of Mrs Grundy may brood over a few areas of advertising acceptability but for the most part the double standard lives
TV: NO ONE STEALS THE POPE'S SCENES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/arts/tv-no-one-steals-the-pope-s-scenes.html,How has Pope John Paul II been playing on television So far remarkably well the Pope dominates television almost by ignoring it At the same time its clear that no one will ever steal a scene while hes on camera John Paul forces the action to come to him In part it is stage presence the Pope is remarkably telegenic In part it is his habit of holding himself physically apart while other people speak Always he appears to be lost in thought while he considers what they say He sets the stage so to speak for his own appearance Consider the Popes arrival in Miami on Thursday afternoon when President Reagan gave a welcoming address the Pope scarcely glanced in Mr Reagans direction When the Pope and the President emerged from a meeting that night  in time for live coverage on the CBS and NBC evening news broadcasts  the Pope looked at the ground while Mr Reagan gave a brief speech The television image is of a man apart from his fellows The image would be death to an elected politician but it suits John Paul as Pope Actually it seems to be part of his armor Think of the Popes tour  9 cities in 10 days  partly as a giant television production Cameras record every public moment A Theme in the News At the same time the news coverage has had a theme dissent among Roman Catholics in the United States As Bill Blakemore said on an intelligent ABC News special on Thursday night Many Americans profoundly disagree with the Pope on sexrelated issues  birth control abortion homosexuality women in the priesthood The Pope news coverage has suggested is beleaguered Nonetheless the same ABC program also said the Pope had redefined charisma Meanwhile on a CBS News special the Rev Jerry Falwell was asked if the Pope would make a good television evangelist John Paul could do it Mr Falwell said enthusiastically If the Pope got rid of the robes and other trappings of office Mr Falwell declared hed be magnificent One wonders about that on television the trappings are part of the appeal As it happens Mr Falwell also appeared on the regular news broadcasts Thursday night going down a water slide at Heritage Village fully clothed He had promised to do that if enough donors sent in 1000 checks to help the troubled ministry he inherited from the Rev Jim Bakker They did and so in great good humor he dunked The Charisma of Gravity There was nothing particularly unbecoming about this but robes or no robes it would hardly be John Pauls style Part of his charisma is his gravity John Paul defies conventional television wisdom Each times he speaks he reads from a prepared text We see a priest handing him big sheets of white paper Then when he reads he keeps his head down Often he pauses apparently while he reads ahead in the text Often he mispronounces English words  bicentennial for example comes out as bicenteenial inevitable is two words inevitable The Pope would give an American media consultant fits Change the image though and the Pope would not be nearly so effective On television the Pope appears to be his own man utterly unselfconscious and touched not at all by small concerns Its likely that he cares very much about what viewers think of him  the 20 million tour after all is a spectacular example of television proselytizing  but this is never apparent On television the Pope simply dwells in a different sphere The Pope and the Rabbi The Cable News Network showed a striking example yesterday morning The Pope met with prominent American Jews Their spokesman Rabbi Mordecai Waxman chairman of the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations asked among other things why the Vatican did not formally recognize Israel Rabbi Waxman who knows a thing or two about public speaking himself gave a particularly eloquent speech Meanwhile whenever the camera pulled back from Rabbi Waxman and showed the small stage we saw the Pope He sat slumped in a chair He moved only to put his chin in his hand Was he listening to Rabbi Waxman Was he praying Was he even heaven forbid sound asleep We didnt know but whatever he was doing he looked majestic When Rabbi Waxman finished a priest appeared with the inevitable white sheets of paper The Pope read the text As nearly as this viewer could tell he made only one interpolation I am thinking also of the contribution of Martin Buber So much for spontaneity and once again the Pope had scarcely raised his head while he spoke By conventional standards it was not much of a speech Then Tom Mintnier a CNN reporter summarized what the Pope had said He indicated correctly that the Pope had made few concessions to the Jews Nonetheless we also heard what sounded like Rabbi Waxmans voice apparently caught by an open microphone on the stage It comes from the heart not the lips the voice said If it was Rabbi Waxman he was clearly moved Conventional standards applied to John Paul are of no use at all
CUOMO QUESTIONS BORK'S OBJECTIVITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/cuomo-questions-bork-s-objectivity.html,Governor Cuomo in his strongest comments to date on Judge Robert H Bork yesterday questioned the judges ability to serve objectively on the Supreme Court and expressed sharp reservations about whether the Senate should confirm him Mr Cuomo in an interview that touched on a range of national topics from Gary Hart to taxes stressed that he would not reach a final opinion on Judge Bork until the end of the Senate confirmation hearings that begin this week But the Governor also said he and Senator Joseph R Biden a Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee had discussed by telephone strategies for blocking the nomination I believe the important thing for Biden to do Mr Cuomo said is to make it clear that Bork was selected not for his objectivity but because the President believes Bork will give him the results the President desires politically  for example cut back on affirmative action The evidence that thats what the President wants and expects is in the statements by lobbyists on behalf of Bork who are talking to conservatives and telling them that if Bork is selected youll get a change in abortion youll get a change in criminal justice Thats the proof positive A Midnight Interview Asked if Mr Biden was in a difficult political position as chairman of the hearings the Governor said Biden is in a nolose situation The damage he might have suffered he has already suffered The allusion was to criticism of the Senator who is seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination for speaking out against Judge Bork before the hearings have even begun At the same time however the Governor made it clear that Mr Biden was now obligated to supply proof to back up his criticism of Judge Bork Biden he said will have to prove it with evidence  documentation that Reagans people produce the lobbying argument Mr Cuomos comments came in a midnight interview aboard a commercial flight carrying him back to New York from a speaking engagement in Anaheim Calif Among the points he made in the interview and in a conversation Thursday night were these  He said he thought Gary Hart still had an interest in running for President although not necessarily in 1988 despite the former Colorado Senators announcement Tuesday night that he would not reenter the race for the Democratic nomination  The Governor denied published reports that he would endorse a Democratic Presidential candidate by February or March and said that his endorsement would almost certainly be made later than that  Asked about speculation in Albany that Assembly Speaker Mel Miller a fellow Democrat might soon endorse Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts for President Mr Cuomo said that would be unwise for both Mr Miller and Mr Dukakis The Governor said that if there was an impression that one New York politician had become the leading early supporter of Mr Dukakis then other key New York Democrats might perceive Mr Dukakis as already spoken for and shop around for a candidate of their own to support Advice to Jouralists Mr Cuomo also offered some advice to journalists suggesting a standard for when to report on a candidates sex life and other private activities He pointed out that the Federal Government conducted undercover operations in which disguised agents offer cash to officials in return for illegal favors only against those officials it has reason to believe would commit illegal acts Likewise the Governor suggested news organizations should not randomly ask officials about their sex lives or other private activities but should pursue such inquiries only with officials for whom there are grounds for suspicion Mr Hart withdrew from the Presidential race last May amid published reports that he spent a weekend in his Washington town house with a 29yearold Miami model The reports followed a Miami newspapers surveillance of Mr Hart and Mr Harts own denials of womanizing Mr Cuomos 26minute Anaheim speech and answers to questions from the audience drew a standing ovation from a small but influential group of 150 leading radiostation operators The Governor reaffirmed his support of President Reagans veto of legislation requiring television and radio stations to broadcast both sides of controversial issues Although the Governor was once again on the road and addressing a group that could be helpful in a Presidential campaign  both in terms of access to airwaves and raising money  he again asserted he was not a candidate for the White House He did however question the current way Presidents are chosen saying that it required so many years of campaigning that incumbents in other offices were precluded from running because they could not afford the time away from their duties In the question period the Governor once again hinted that Federal income tax rates might have to be raised to close the budget deficit but once again avoided an outright call for a tax increase
JUDICIAL REVIEW; The Final Say,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/magazine/judicial-review-the-final-say.html,ARTICLE III Section 2 The judicial Power shall extend to all case NOT LONG AGO A NEW YORK TIMESCBS News Poll showed that nearly a third of the American people surveyed opposed judicial review the process by which the lower Federal courts and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States can pass judgment on constitutional challenges to legislative and executive actions Many Americans it seems prefer that the executive and legislative branches check and balance themselves In the same poll only 16 percent of the public favored life tenure for Supreme Court justices Even when life tenure was explained as providing judges with independence from political pressures only 35 percent favored it The publics distaste for the authority of the Federal judiciary to decide the constitutionality of governmental actions has found a voice in of all people the Attorney General of the United States Last fall Edwin Meese 3d issued a surprisingly casual invitation to government officials throughout the country to disregard Supreme Court decisions on constitutional matters in cases to which they were not parties His reasoning the Courts views are not to be confused with the Constitution itself Certainly there are contexts in which the Constitutions own structure gives Congress or the President or the states the last word in constitutional debate For example if a President vetoes a bill because he believes it to be unconstitutional the Supreme Court cannot reach out to overrule that veto should it disagree with the Presidents constitutional analysis Nor can the Court correct the Senates rejection of a Presidents Supreme Court nominee whose views of the Constitution it deems dangerous The controversy surrounding the nomination of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court confirms that the power of the Senate to give advice and consent on Presidential appointments remains a potent political influence on the power and independence of the judiciary But outside these special spheres constitutional chaos would ensue  and the peculiar significance of the Constitution in our public life would be at an end  if every Federal agency every school district every city council felt free to act on its own constitutional theory unless and until sued by its latest victim and brought into line by the Supreme Court Our society would be wholly unworkable if the meaning of the legal documents by which we regulate our lives and conduct our affairs  contracts deeds wills statutes the Constitution itself  were to be determined by each of us according to individual interests and opinions The meaning of a legal document in any particular context is ultimately  and necessarily  a judicial question So it is that Article III of the Constitution provides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as the Congress may    establish Well aware of the gravity of such questions of legal interpretation especially with respect to a nations fundamental charter the framers elevated the judiciary  heretofore the captive creature of monarchs chancellors and parliaments  to the status of an independent and equal third branch of government THE DECISION OF THE FRAMERS TO PLACE their faith  and the Constitution  in the hands of an independent judiciary was not predicated on the assumption that the Supreme Court would always reach a correct reading of that document Certainly the Courts infamous decisions affirming racial separation if the facilities  schools and restrooms  were equal or the ones handed down after the attack on Pearl Harbor allowing Americans of Japanese descent to be herded into detention camps without proof of wrongdoing do not strike us today as correct The importance of the Court was instead well summarized in Justice Robert Jacksons mildly cynical assessment We are not final because we are infallible but we are infallible only because we are final The absolute finality of Court decisions  barring a constitutional amendment or subsequent reversal by the Court itself  does more than give gravity to that bodys pronouncements on constitutional matters it makes constitutional arguments and determinations count in a way that they would not count if each government official were bound only by that persons own opinion of the Constitutions meaning Yet the authority of the Supreme Court to exert such influence over the country as a whole and even its authority to make the parties before it  Richard M Nixon in the famous Watergate Tapes case for example  abide by its reading of the Constitution are not spelled out anywhere in the document Decades of scholarly debate have left little doubt about the reason the Constitution was silent on the issue of judicial review The framers said nothing about it simply because they took it for granted They were after all creating neither a pure nor even a representative democracy but a constitutional democracy We the people who ordain and establish this Constitution were not to be confused with the popular majority of any given historical moment not even the historical moment of the founders generation when  as Justice Thurgood Marshall stressed in a speech last May  only a handful of propertied white males were eligible to participate in governance Without lodging power in an independent judiciary to enforce the peoples enduring Constitution against those who happen to wield power at any given moment the document would in all likelihood be reduced to a dead letter  a matter for idle talk signifying little or nothing of operational moment Yet the very independence of the Federal judiciary that makes it possible for it to perform this unique function exposes it to attack as elitist undemocratic and countermajoritarian a form of government without the consent of the governed Such an attack is not easily dismissed But it also does not provide a guide to how judges should decide constitutional questions It is as inconclusive as the doctrine of original intent so warmly embraced by legal conservatives As Justice Antonin Scalia observed in an opinion last June discovering the subjective intentions even of the handful of lawmakers who enacted a relatively recent statute is to be honest almost always an impossible task Joined by Chief Justice William H Rehnquist Justice Scalia conceded that searching for the sole purpose of even a single legislator is probably searching for something that does not exist When one turns to the Constitution and its amendments ratified by state conventions or legislatures containing more than 1600 members the search is even more confounding In any event it is the Constitutions sometimes deliberately general text and not the unenacted thoughts of those who drafted or approved it that binds future generations The fact that many of the legislators who ratified the 14th Amendment in 1868 believed black and white children should be segregated by law does not discredit subsequent interpretations of the equalprotection clause NEITHER ORIGINAL INTENT NOR the virtues of governing according to the consent of the governed leads to a useful general formula for how to approach difficult constitutional cases Consider perhaps the hardest case of modern times Roe v Wade the Supreme Courts often reaffirmed but still controversial decision in 1973 affirming a womans right to an abortion If the Supreme Courts ruling is problematic because the Constitution was unclear on the subject leaving the matter in local hands would hardly be less so After all may either women or the unborn be said to have consented to a regime under which the fates of both would be disposed of by local majorities The very purpose of a Bill of Rights Justice Jackson wrote when the Supreme Court struck down the compulsory flag salute in 1943 was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts We might amend the observation by adding the very purpose of a Constitution is to place certain principles both of individual liberty and of government structure beyond the reach of contemporary majorities  and of those accountable to them JUDICIAL REVIEWS MOST VITAL ROLE HAS BEEN TO evaluate both traditional and emerging political practices in terms of ideals expressed in the Constitution thereby insuring that crucial controversies over what kind of nation we are  and would become are ultimately reconciled with the fundamental principles of the nation The Supreme Courts challenge to the socialwelfare state in the first third of this century  in decisions striking down minimumwage laws childlabor laws and the like  reflected a genuine tension between the Constitutions textual protections of contract and property rights and newer imperatives favoring governmental activism in regulating the economy and redistributing wealth After the Court abruptly changed course in 1937 that tension was resolved in favor of an active role for government But the reversal in no way proves that judicial review as an institution illserved the nation If the Courts earlier review of activist legislation seemed to impede social and economic progress the later review was the vehicle through which socialwelfare legislation finally established its legitimacy So too Roe v Wades challenge to the entrenched legal tradition denying women sexual and reproductive freedom reflects a profound tension between longstanding rules governing sexuality and reproduction on the one hand and the Constitutions guarantees of liberty and equality on the other Whether history ultimately deems the Supreme Courts protection of a womans right to choose to be wisdom or folly just or unjust it is beyond cavil that such a profound issue must be resolved in terms of the principles by which we have constituted ourselves as a nation What counts most in assessing the value of an independent judiciary reviewing government actions for consistency with the Constitution is not which challenges succeed and which fail What counts most is how an independent judiciary in making such challenges possible compels political discourse to address issues of power in the language of constitutional principles that connects our past to our aspirations In the face of polls indicating public disfavor for an independent judiciary one wonders whether people would continue to hold these views after thinking long and hard about the sort of country we would have if the Constitutions interpretation and enforcement were indeed entrusted to a process more closely linked to electoral politics Only a decade ago the Supreme Court overturned a jail sentence imposed on a grandmother for the crime of violating her neighborhoods statutory ideal of the nuclear family because she raised grandchildren who were cousins rather than brothers Would people really want judges so restrained by popular will that citizens could be prosecuted for such offenses Would they really want judges so lacking in independence that a government agency could put highways through their backyards without paying them just compensation I hope not It would be sad indeed if our historic commitment to constitutionalism weakened by the Reagan Administrations assaults on the Supreme Court and its work had so eroded that the Constitutions principle of judicial independence were replaced with political buzzwords like judicial restraint and original intent That would make the Constitutions bicentennial less a birthday than a wake
STATES RIGHTS; Power To the People,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/magazine/states-rights-power-to-the-people.html,AMENDMENT IX The enumeration  of certain rights shall not  deny or disparage others retained by the people AMENDMENT X The powers not delegated to the United States  nor prohibited  to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO have for more than 200 years largely defined ourselves politically by our commitment to the proposition that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights The lines Thomas Jefferson penned in the Declaration of Independence provided a principled guide for the founders of this Republic who framed the Constitution For all our time as a nation we have held firmly to the belief that any government to be legitimate must rest upon the consent of the governed and be designed to secure the rights of the people But for the founders delivering the basic philosophical thesis was in many respects the simple part their real challenge lay in designing the Government As Jeffersons lifelong friend and collaborator James Madison observed in The Federalist No 51 In framing a government to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the Government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself As evidence of how difficult Madisons ideal is to achieve consider what is now being perpetrated upon the American public I refer to the contemporary notion that the rights of the people can be made secure not by government as a whole but only by a morally zealous and apparently constitutionally boundless Federal judiciary that undertakes almost at will to create and enforce new rights out of whole cloth Take for example Wyatt v Aderholt a 1974 Court of Appeals decision in Alabama The United States District Court had ordered three state mental institutions to provide specified levels of psychiatric care and treatment to those committed to the facilities It issued highly detailed orders regarding the care that patients were to receive and declared that these orders represented what it called constitutional minimums The hospitals themselves and the state authorities were bypassed and the courts simply read their notions of proper care into the Constitution Or consider Kite v Marshall a case decided in 1981 by a Federal court in Texas High school athletes who attended summer training camps were barred by a Texas school rule from varsity sports the following season But the court declared that parents had a constitutional right to send a child to summer basketball camp THIS STRETCHING OF THE CONSTITUTION to override local authority undermines communities rights to selfgovernment and leaves citizens in a perpetual state of uncertainty as to what the Constitution will suddenly turn out to require or prohibit Moreover such creation of new rights does not take place in a vacuum If the right to send a child to summer basketball camp is so basic that it cannot be interfered with in any way then school districts lose the right to set their own rules for varsity sports which they might want to do for instance to insure fair competition among high school athletes Every arbitrary judicial empowerment of one person or entity is a disempowerment of some other person or entity Such decisions do not increase societys overall stock of rights  but they greatly increase the power of the courts What is most distressing is that the means often chosen to effect this reformation of rights have been the use and abuse of the Ninth and 10th Amendments to the Constitution The language of these amendments is crisp and clear The Ninth states The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people The 10th is equally succinct it states The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people At the time they were drafted as the concluding amendments in the Bill of Rights the Ninth and 10th Amendments were understood to be linked The Ninth reserved certain unspecified rights to the people and the 10th reserved certain unspecified powers to the people and to the states Together these amendments were meant to provide an obstacle to expansion of national authority But what the founders put together our generation has rent asunder The amendments have been severed the Ninth has been misread as a grant of increased power to the Federal judiciary and the 10th has been rendered essentially meaningless As a consequence we have experienced a radical enlargement of the national Governments power and control over not only our daytoday lives but also over the legitimate authority of the states Perhaps the most tragic casualty in the process has been the framers original commitment to limited and decentralized government which has all but disappeared OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY has enlarged its power through generous and sometimes extravagant constructions of the Bill of Rights A constraining influence for a part of this time at least was the language of the constitutional provisions enumerating specific rights It is difficult to transform the right to free speech or even the right to due process of law into a right to housing or to a particular standard of living without doing monstrous violence to constitutional language But in 1965 the courts found their way around this impediment through the Ninth Amendment with its general reference to unspecified  [ other rights ] retained by the people That year the Supreme Court decided Griswold v Connecticut holding that a Connecticut statute making the use of contraceptives a crime could not constitutionally be applied to married couples In a concurring opinion Justice Arthur J Goldberg asserted that the language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights protected from governmental infringement which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments He regarded as among those additional fundamental rights the right of privacy in the marital relation which in his view was thereby entitled to constitutional protection against the Connecticut statute The genie was out of the bottle and over the last two decades the Ninth Amendment has been invoked in hundreds of cases to challenge everything from the military draft to obscenity laws to criminal statutes regarding homosexual sodomy Roe v Wade  the 1973 decision that overturned abortionrelated laws passed by popularly elected legislatures in all 50 states a decision that has been assailed by constitutional scholars on both sides of the abortion issue  is only the bestknown example The tradition spawned by this use of the Ninth Amendment distorts basic logic and misapprehends constitutional theory The Bill of Rights including its nexttolast amendment places specific constraints on the power of the national Government constraints that apply no less to the judicial branch than to the legislative or executive branches To reverse that firm understanding by judicial fiat makes a mockery of the entire concept of a national government of limited separate and enumerated powers  the very essence of our idea of constitutionalism No less fundamentally to argue that constitutional rights can exist without being mentioned in the document is to desecrate the very idea of rights that may be termed constitutional As Thomas Jefferson so well appreciated there may indeed be rights that antedate and transcend the specifics of the Constitution but one cannot sensibly identify such rights as constitutional unless and until they are explicitly included in the text And no manner of judicial legerdemain under the Ninth Amendment alters that reality Simultaneously activist judges have regarded the 10th Amendment  originally intended as a barrier to protect and preserve state sovereignty from Federal intrusion  with disdain The culmination came in 1985 with Garcia v San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority a case that many experts agree hurls the 10th Amendment right out of the Constitution The facts of Garcia may lack the stuff of high drama  they concern the regulations of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and the power of Congress to demand that states and localities abide by Federal rules in matters such as transit police and fire protection matters traditionally understood to be local functions But the impact of the decision was devastating It not only unceremoniously overruled an earlier Supreme Court decision it abandoned nearly 200 years of sound practice In effect Garcia established the idea that states lack any independent sovereign status immune to the intrusions of the national Government As Justice Lewis F Powell Jr said in his dissenting opinion the Court rendered Congress free under the commerce clause to assume a states traditional sovereign power and to do so without judicial review of its action The Court effectively repealed the 10th Amendment all on its own HE JUDICIAL DISFIGUREMENT OF THE Ninth and 10th Amendments has had the effect of dramatically reducing the size and vitality of the public arenas in which the opinions of We the People are most readily apparent  the states Under the original design of the Constitution the states mattered they were left the sovereignty sufficient to handle most of the things we think a government ought to do The idea was that greater political access and involvement would attend the lower levels of government where the people were far more likely to have their opinions passions and interests expressed and debated Those lower levels would understandably be more responsive to the people and just as logically be more accountable to the people This division of sovereignty  between national and state government  was intended as James Madison said to provide a double security to the rights of the people To argue for a restoration of division of sovereignty is not to argue for the imposition of any one social agenda Under their own steam states might pursue either liberal or conservative policies It is rather to argue for restoring to the people the latitude to set for themselves the moral legal and political tone of their states and communities Nor would a return of the judiciary to its proper sphere imperil minority groups rights The rights that are explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution are guaranteed equally to members of minorities whether political ethnic religious or other and the enforcement of these rights is within the proper scope of the judiciary For any other rights real or merely claimed minorities and majorities alike must have recourse to public debate and to political action aimed at legislatures Ironically the jurisprudential theories that support the radical expansion of the Ninth Amendment and have contributed to the startling demise of the 10th are themselves a powerful means of imposing a social order The people themselves might very likely not freely embrace such an order in the political process  it can only be imposed from a distance by unelected officials appointed for life who shape policies by judicial decree and are accountable to no one During this bicentennial year of the Constitution we need to remember that judicial power no less than the legislative and executive powers is an exercise of political power That is why the Constitution  in its text and original intent  limits judicial power no less than the others We could do no better than to recall Jeffersons pointed warning to an earlier generation of Americans It is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power In questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution

AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION; How Hard It Is To Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/magazine/amending-the-constitution-how-hard-it-is-to-change.html,ARTICLE V The Congress  propose Amendments to this Constitution or  shall call a Convention I WORKED HARD FOR MANY YEARS TO change the United States Constitution  and I failed Like so many others I wanted the Constitution to assert the principle of equal rights without regard to gender I had high hopes for the equal rights amendment but I knew from the beginning that a constitutional amendment is difficult to obtain So I was not surprised when the measure failed I was disappointed at the defeat but no less glad that the Constitution is so hard to change I appreciate even more deeply now the obstacles the framers of the Constitution put in the way of the amendment process The reason is simple even though my efforts were unsuccessful and there is no ERA in the Constitution there is also no official school prayer amendment or antiabortion amendment Article V of the Constitution  the amending article  plays no favorites It disciplines even the most ardent proponents to its commands and occasionally turns opponents into allies There is an irony of sorts for instance that Phyllis Schlafly who did so much to stop the ERA and I now find ourselves in agreement in opposing a constitutional convention that has lately been proposed to consider a balanced budget amendment Ill get to our unlikely alliance a little later The makers of the Constitution wanted to create a firm basis for the exercise of governmental power However they were wise enough to know that if they made their document too rigid if they wrote it so that it could not be revised to suit future times and events they were inviting future revolution They would be creating a situation in which the only method to effect change would be to cast aside the Constitution itself As George Mason noted at the 1787 convention changes would be necessary and it would be better to provide for them in an easy regular and constitutional way than to trust to chance and violence So they made it open to change  but not open to change without great effort James Madison was among those who warned against making things too easy It was important he said to guard against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable For if it could be altered easily the Constitution would be mere temporary law not a document for the ages The great idea in Article V is that change requires two elements consensus and necessity There must be substantive national agreement as well as agreement in most of the states that an urgent problem exists that cannot be remedied by the courts legislatures or Congress and which can be solved only if the Constitution is changed THE PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF CONSENSUS and necessity that Article V requires can come to light in two ways In the first an amendment may be proposed by a twothirds vote in each house of Congress The approved amendment then must be ratified by majority votes in the legislatures or conventions of threefourths of the states before it can become part of the Constitution The second way is that if twothirds of the states ask for a constitutional convention to consider amendments Congress should be obliged to call one Any changes such a convention passes must then be ratified by threefourths of the states This second path has so far gone untried in United States history no constitutional convention since the first one in 1787 has ever been called Meanwhile the first route to constitutional amendments has been well traveled Almost 10000 of them have been proposed in the Congress since Article V became law Only 26 have been ratified Of these the Bill of Rights the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments resulting from the Civil War and the 19th permitting women to vote remedied major defects in the original document Most of the others smoothed out procedural difficulties One Prohibition was the result of an artificial consensus and was soon repealed Six other amendments have been approved by Congress but not ratified by the states These include the ERA an amendment to prohibit child labor and an amendment that would have given the District of Columbia a voting member of the House and two Senators It is easy to see why so many amendments have been proposed in Congress For politicians advocating solution by amendment is a convenient response to hot political problems For instance whenever the Supreme Court makes a widely publicized decision on a controversial issue there are Congressional proposals to limit the power of the Justices The legislator can thereby show concerned voters back home that action however ineffectual has been taken something has been done It is clear that a strong effort to gain an amendment can influence government even when it fails It acts as a brooding omnipresence in the sky signaling to politicians that they must act Some proposals that fail as amendments result in legislation Proposed amendments reflecting public opposition to busing for desegregation purposes led to a 1972 education law restricting Federal involvement in busing More recently official school prayer amendment proposals led to the passage of the Equal Access Act of 1984 which provides that religious activities may not be excluded from among any extracurricular activities allowed on a public schools premises Instead of passing an amendment requiring the balancing of the Federal budget Congress in 1985 tried the expedient of enacting the GrammRudmanHollings Act to achieve a balanced budget in stages In each of these cases the stringent requirements for ratification of an amendment have prevented changing the Constitution But politicians who needed to do so could show constituents that they were responding to their concerns In the case of an amendment calling for a balanced budget however apprehensions about the Federal deficit have created a feeling of necessity that may not be satisfied by legislation The issue may well bring about the first constitutional convention since 1787 Already 32 states only two fewer than required have called for a convention to consider a budgetbalancing amendment and President Reagan supports the idea Proponents of the convention say it would be a fast easy assembly that would simply meet adopt an amendment send it to the states to ratify and then go home Those who oppose the convention including myself are not sure Ordinarily disparate forces such as Phyllis Schlaflys Eagle Forum the National Organization for Women the American Civil Liberties Union and the John Birch Society are all opposed because they fear the convention has the potential of putting the Constitution at risk The fact is nothing in the language of Article V limits the subjects to be considered at a constitutional convention nothing establishes rules of procedure to be followed or precludes scrapping the entire Constitution The sole convention we have had in 1787 was called only for the purpose of amending our first constitution the Articles of Confederation But the Founding Fathers discarded the Articles altogether and drafted a new document They even modified the ratification procedure to insure success That could happen again The purpose of Article Vs convention provision is to make it possible for amendments to be proposed that Congress does not want proposed and it would be illogical indeed to assume that Congress could bind a conventions agenda Even if the Congress decided to call a convention for the sole purpose of proposing amendments to balance the budget and even if the convention agreed to this overall goal the gathering would still have great freedom The participants might decide that Congressional budgetary authority should be limited to support for the national defense They could delete support for the general welfare from the Constitution thus precluding such items as Social Security Medicaid and Medicare They could decide to amend Congressional power to regulate commerce which now allows for such activities as environmental regulation labor regulation and antitrust enforcement This would after all abolish a whole series of Federal agencies and decrease the budget BUT IF THE PARTICIPANTS DECIDED TO IGNORE any instructions controlling their agenda  and who could stop them  they could decide to ban abortion and void the First Amendment require the government to provide jobs housing and education for all Americans or any other proposal that gained approval by whatever majority they decided to require Any proposals that gained ratification by threefourths of the states would become part of the nations fundamental law However the convention might decide as the original convention did to change the mode of ratification perhaps to require only a simple majority of the states Given this very real possibility for wideranging action and unprecedented mischief the pertinent question is not whether we want a constitutional convention to require a balanced budget but whether we want to risk a convention at all I AM TEMPTED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT BELIEVERS in pure democracy and majoritarian rule ought to favor a convention in order to let the people reign and make whatever decisions they choose However the Founding Fathers created not pure democracy but a republican form of government in which the people govern through their representatives and with checks and balances including a check on the majoritys impulses I am reminded in my service on the United States Commission on Civil Rights whenever issues such as voting rights or affirmative action come before us of how dangerous it would be to define civil rights by the will of an administration elected by a political majority In our system of government the rights of all liberals and conservatives people of all races and both sexes the majority and minority groups are accorded constitutional protection The amendment process set up in Article V allows our government to adapt itself to social change At the same time it gives us a check against beliefs that may be strongly held but are not widely approved Because our Constitution can be amended we can repair tears in our social fabric and try different strategies and tactics to resolve problems Because our Constitution cannot be amended easily we can preserve the stability and continuity that lasting republican government requires
CIVIL RIGHTS; To Make A Nation Whole,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/magazine/civil-rights-to-make-a-nation-whole.html,ARTICLE I Section 2 Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several Statesby adding to the whole Number of free Personsthree fifths of all other Persons AMENDMENT XIV Section 4 Nor deny to any personthe equal protection of the laws FOR WEAL OR FOR WOE THE DESTINY of the colored race in this country is wrapped up with our own they are to remain in our midst and here spend their years and here bury their fathers and finally repose themselves    We cannot help it Our forefathers introduced them and their destiny is to continue among us and the practical question which now presents itself to us is as to the best mode of getting along with them The year was 1866 The speaker was Jacob Merritt Howard Republican Senator from Michigan abolitionist and key architect of the 14th Amendment His belief that blacks were different from and less worthy than whites had been the accepted rationalization when the nations forefathers introduced them as slaves The status of the blacks as property had confounded the Constitutions framers They denied slaves the right to vote and every other right for that matter even as they allowed each slave to be counted as threefifths of a person for the purpose of augmenting Southern representation in Congress This flawed their work and set the stage for the Civil War Senator Howards apprehension about the prospect of black people living free in white America has echoed through the history of civil rights decisions It has frequently been the case that the racial relief granted by Federal legislation and the courts has been determined less by the nature of injustices to blacks and other minority groups than by the disadvantages the proposed relief would impose on the majority of whites As a result most of what is called racial reform has been conciliatory rather than crusading and ironically has benefited all Americans as much as if not more than it has relieved the suffering of individual minority groups These principles can be codified in what I call the Rules of Race Relations Laws The 14th Amendments history offers a fertile field for the exposition of these rules AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ALTHOUGH vanquished on the battlefield the South stood to win a political victory On the one hand Black Codes a series of laws enacted in Southern legislatures to maintain black subservience mocked the 13th Amendments prohibition of involuntary servitude On the other ostensibly emancipated blacks would be counted fully for purposes of representation and as a result the former Confederate states would return to Congress with more power than they held before the Civil War To prevent the perpetuation of Southern political power in postCivil War government Northerners proposed the 14th Amendment which would confer citizenship rights on blacks In addition it would insure Republican that is to say Northern control of Congress by threatening to reduce the representation of states that denied the right to vote to males over the age of 21 and by barring from public office Southerners who had participated in the rebellion after previously taking an oath to support the Constitution Still proponents feared that their ploy would not gain Congressional approval if its sole purpose was to extend citizenship rights to former slaves Thus all citizens were granted Federal protection against state infringement of due process and equal protection of the laws Through judicial interpretation these basic 14th Amendment rights have gradually been expanded and now encompass virtually the entire Bill of Rights which was originally intended to guard against the encroachment on individual rights by the Federal Government not the states Thus the enactment of the 14th Amendment is the definitive example of my First Rule of Race Relations Laws Racial remedies are the outward manifestations of unspoken and perhaps unconscious conclusions that such remedies  if adopted  will secure advance or at least not harm the interests of whites in power SHORTLY AFTER THE 14TH AMENDMENT WAS RATIFIED corporate lawyers began to realize its potential as a defense against the efforts of state legislatures to protect workers from the exploitative policies of industrial growth Invoking the amendments offer of Federal protection against state interference with basic rights to all persons American business persuaded the Supreme Court to hold that corporations too were persons So from the 1870s until Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal the provision was used to nurture as Prof Boris I Bittker of the Yale Law School has written railroads utility companies banks employers of child labor chain stores money lenders aliens and a host of other groups and institutions     leaving so little room for the Negro that he seemed to be the 14th Amendments forgotten man While the 14th Amendment was transformed from guardian of the benighted blacks to protector of propertied interests the country and the Supreme Court accepted the seemingly neutral but grossly unjust separate but equal standard promulgated in Plessy v Ferguson 1896 as the constitutional justification for the racial segregation that insured the subordination of blacks The laws failure to protect black rights reflects another common phenomenon that can be reduced to my Second Rule of Race Relations Law The benefits to blacks of civil rights policies are often symbolic rather than substantive and when the crisis that prompted their enactment ends they will infrequently be enforced for blacks though in altered interpretations they may serve the needs of whites IF FROM THE 14TH AMENDMENTS RATIFICATION until the present racial policymaking has generally accommodated the needs of whites over the claims of blacks for racial justice what of the Supreme Courts famous decision in Brown v Board of Education which in 1954 overturned Plessy v Ferguson and outlawed racial segregation in the public schools Surely this muchcited precedent heralded a basic change of attitude among whites Alas history supports a more cynical conclusion In dozens of cases for several decades before Brown blacks had pleaded in vain that statesponsored segregation particularly in the public schools was incompatible with the guarantees of the 14th Amendment But in coldwar America the arguments against segregated schools presented by civil rights litigants were enhanced by the benefits that society as a whole stood to gain Brown offered much needed reassurance to all Americans at a time when militant blacks such as Paul Robeson were warning that blacks would never fight against the Soviet Union as long as they were discriminated against at home Further many white businessmen realized that the South could effectively develop from a rural plantation society into a profitable economic force only by ending statesponsored segregation Abroad the Brown decision was a potent propaganda weapon strengthening the country in its competition with the Soviet Union to win the hearts and minds of emerging thirdworld peoples As Time magazine put it In many countries where US prestige and leadership have been damaged by the fact of US segregation [ Brown ] will come as a timely reassertion of the basic American principle that all men are created equal  DO NOT DISCOUNT THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS to civil rights by whites for whom recognition of racial injustice and a desire to correct it have been sufficient motivation But today as always the number of whites willing to act on morality alone to eliminate racially discriminatory practices is insufficient to bring about reform On the other hand in spite of their often discouraging struggle blacks have achieved for whites as well as for themselves a wide array of individual rights now protected by the 14th Amendment As Prof Paul A Freund of the Harvard Law School has observed The frontiers of the law have been pushed back by the civil rights movement in many sectors that are far broader than the interests of the movement itself The classic example of how black remedies augment white rights is the one person one vote ruling of 1964 For decades voting districts in many states were drawn to favor the powerful few over the quasidisenfranchised many The catalyzing injustice occurred in Alabama when the state legislature fearing the growing numbers of black voters registered in the city of Tuskegee redrew the district lines so as to exclude virtually all blacks from the city The Supreme Court was forced to act in order to protect basic black suffrage and in doing so maintained the legitimacy of the entire apportionment process The stark light of the Tuskegee precedent made it obvious that political gerrymandering diluted votes and violated 14th Amendment rights of whites as well as blacks Thus has racial discrimination served to uncover the equally pernicious disadvantages suffered by many whites This explains why 14th Amendment provisions have become the foundation upon which courts have built a structure of precedent that protects equal rights for women including the stillcontroversial right to an abortion In July 1986 a similar interpretation came within one vote in the Supreme Court of striking down state sodomy laws a major barrier to the universal recognition of the right to sexual preference Out of these precedents I have drawn a Third Rule of Race Relations Laws The injustices that diminish the rights of blacks because of race also diminish the rights of many whites particularly those who lack money and power or are part of an unpopular minority group or movement OF COURSE BECAUSE THE 14TH AMENDMENT is cast in racially colorblind terms efforts to compensate for past discrimination are sometimes challenged by whites who feel victimized by so called affirmativeaction policies Yet institutional decisions routinely involve considerations other than merit Collegeadmissions standards frequently yield to the children of major donors and alumni In matters of employment considerations such as seniority tenure veteran status and personal contacts influence hiring and promotion as much as does objective merit And yet only affirmativeaction policies seem to provoke outrage and litigation The paradox is illustrated in United Steelworkers of America v Weber 1979 There Kaiser Aluminum a company that had long resisted union requests to provide special training programs for unskilled employees finally established such a program in the midst of increasing charges of racial discrimination The program admitted equal numbers of black and white workers Brian F Weber a worker denied admission under the white allocation sought to have the courts invalidate the program because some of the blacks who had been admitted had less seniority than he But for the civilrights pressure there would have been no companysponsored training at all and in light of the fact that the program was a private and voluntary affirmativeaction effort the Supreme Court found against Weber Conflicts such as this garner headlines but the morenumerous challenges to governmental support of the privileges of wealth and class reflect the real potential of the 14th Amendment The wellbeing of a capitalist country espousing individual equality depends on the laws ability to protect both property interests  as intended in the original Constitution  and the rights of those without property It is in the furtherance of this latter task that the 14th Amendments dueprocess and equalprotection clauses have become as Prof William Nelson of the New York University School of Law has said the text upon which most 20thcentury constitutional law is a gloss In spite of ambivalent beginnings the 14th Amendment has lessened the gap between the nations egalitarian ideals and its often exploitative practices Future progress may well depend less on the efforts of blacks than on the recognition by whites of the amendments capacity to protect their rights too against infringement by powerful interests Neither race will be well served if the amendment simply protects the status quo by providing easy answers to Senator Howards practical question    as to the best mode of getting

Commerce Secretary had all the marks of an Ayn Rand hero C William Verity Jr his colleagues said was strong He was a maverick He bristled with selfesteem He spent his career building a business and working to unsnarl the cats cradle of government regulations In the picture accompanying the announcement of his Cabinet post he looked appropriately jutjawed and steely eyed And as it turned out Bill Verity was a fan of Ayn Rand Ive read Atlas Shrugged and so have my children and I think it is a very instructive book Mr Verity said with a forthrightness that Miss Rand would admire The 70yearold Mr Verity the former chairman of Armco the steel company founded by his grandfather clearly identifies with the heroes of Atlas Shrugged Hank Rearden a steel manufacturer and John Galt a man who glorifies reason and proclaims the sacred importance of the creative individual Mr Verity even kept a card on his desk with a passage from Atlas Shrugged instructing that how well you do your work is the only measure of human value The Reagan years will be remembered for certain predilections Officials like to decorate their offices with wooden ducks and wear ties emblazoned with the face of Adam Smith the 18thcentury economist In the fiction line many Reaganites favor the novels of Miss Rand the goddess of enlightened selfishness and soaring free enterprise Just when everyone else was forgetting about Ayn Rand she was discovered by the Reagan Administration said Aram Bakshian Jr a writer who was director of President Reagans speechwriting office from 1981 to 1983 She was a good friend and mentor of Alan Greenspan the new Federal Reserve chairman And Representative Jack F Kemp of New York recalled that when his interest changed from football to political philosophy one of the authors he read was Ayn Rand Miss Rand a native of Russia who lived in New York City until her death in 1982 became a cult figure particularly among college students because of her novels The Fountainhead 1943 and Atlas Shrugged 1957 both of which were panned by critics Her books have sold more than 20 million copies and still sell at the rate of half a million a year Edmund Wilson once confessed Im fascinated by that horrible woman If Ayn pronounced like swine as she used to say Rand is not the guru she once was perhaps it is because a good deal of her capitalist rhetoric has become conventional wisdom She was popular in Mr Reagans more ideological first term when fans such as Martin Anderson Mr Reagans domestic policy adviser kept the flame of objectivism  a belief in complete laissezfaire capitalism and rational selfishness  burning Her blend of philosophy economics and psychology has colored debates on deregulatory actions and issues of personal liberty and privacy She still has a powerful fan club Miss Rand first persuaded Mr Greenspan to go into Government as an economic adviser to President Nixon She said he could help curb spending and move government toward reason as a last resort When I met Ayn Rand I was a free enterpriser in the Adam Smith sense  impressed with the theoretical structure and efficiency of markets Mr Greenspan said in 1974 What she did  through long discussions and lots of arguments into the night  was to make me think why capitalism is not only efficient and practical but also moral Those close to Mr Greenspan say the influence of Miss Rand still shines at odd moments  for instance when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee that he puts the importance of maintaining legal statutes above his personal beliefs This harks back to Miss Rands point in Atlas Shrugged that the only proper functions of government to protect mans rights are the police department the army and to settle disputes by rational rules according to objective law the courts She helped bring back respect for the free market said Douglas Bandow a former White House official who is a senior fellow with the Cato Institute in Washington Miss Rands legacy Mr Bandow said will be as one of a number of strands of philosophical thought that came together in the Reagan Administration She was important along with Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics and Frank Meyer and fusionism the blend of libertarian and conservative movements A Government Gone Mad For Kevin Hopkins a fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington who worked with Mr Anderson and Mr Bandow in the White House She painted a bold stark picture of a government gone mad She conjured up conservatives worst fears which attracted them in the same way that liberals are entranced with stories of nuclear pessimism like Jonathan Schells Fate of the Earth  he said The middle of the road was to Miss Rand a despicable place to be Explaining why she liked the black and white characters in the early work of Mickey Spillane she said Grays dont interest me Selfesteem was a virtue and serving others was a vice And the dollar was her favorite symbol when she sold the film rights to her novels she bought a brooch shaped like a dollar sign At her wake a sixfoot dollar sign stood beside the coffin As the hero of The Fountainhead the brilliant architect Howard Roark put it when he refused to design a housing project for the poor just for the sake of doing something noble A man who works for others without payment is a slave I do not believe that slavery is noble  not in any form nor for any purpose whatsoever President Reagan himself has never expressed much interest in Ayn Rand And ironically since she has become something of the novelist laureate of his Administration Miss Rand was vehemently antiReagan when he challenged Gerald Ford in 1976 and her disciples never saw much sign that she softened toward him over the years She wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1976 I am profoundly opposed to Ronald Reagan Since he denies the right to abortion he cannot be a defender of any rights Since he has no program and no ideology to offer his likeliest motive for entering a Presidential race is powerlust But the fact that she denounced Mr Reagan does not bother Reaganites who like her Representative Kemp for instance remarked that he liked the libertarian aspects of Atlas Shrugged Mr Hopkins of the Hudson Institute suggested that the main difference between Miss Rand and most Reagan conservatives was her atheism Most of us feel that libertarianism and religion are compatible he said But he said that they overlook her atheism for the sake of the greater message Its just like George Orwell he said Orwell was considered a socialist but along with Atlas Shrugged the most influential book among American conservatives is 1984  THE CODE OF COMPETENCE When he was chairman of Armco C William Verity Jr President Reagans nominee for Commerce Secretary kept a small card with this passage from Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged on his desk Theres nothing of any importance in life  except how well you do your work Nothing Only that Whatever else you do will come from that Its the only measure of human value All the codes of ethics theyll try to ram down your throat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece people of their virtues The code of competence is the only system of morality thats on a gold standard
THE PAPAL VISIT; Poor Turnout for Pope in New Orleans: Football and Heat,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/the-papal-visit-poor-turnout-for-pope-in-new-orleans-football-and-heat.html,Pope John Paul II today took on the city whose unofficial theme song is When the Saints Go Marching In But competing with sultry heat secular pleasures such as football and the complexities of his own schedule the Pontiff was greeted by crowds far smaller than those drawn here each year by the fever of Mardi Gras Id give my left eyebrow to get close enough to see him and maybe even make eye contact but Im afraid the crowds will be so dense that that wont be possible said Andree Gelpi who described herself as a devout Catholic I dont think I can tolerate the sun and the heat A Reprise of Miami With temperatures in the 90s the heat was a reprise of that that cut crowds Thursday in Miami on the opening day of the Popes 10day visit to the United States The Pontiff also had the misfortune to schedule his visit here on a tripleheader athletic weekend Tulane University Louisiana State University and the New Orleans Saints professional team all had home games this weekend Finally local officials suggested there was the tight schedule of papal events  a parade in the French Quarter a youth rally in the Superdome an outdoor mass at the university of New orleans forcing the faithful to choose which they would attend Estimates of the crowd gathered for the papal mass ranged from 130000 by the police  about half what was expected  to 200000 by a spokesman for the Archdiocese By 130 PM nearly two hours before the scheduled start of the papal mass in an open field on the university campus many of those gathered sought refuge from the broiling sun Out in the sun it was murder said an early arrival Margaret Ambrose 55 years old of Pensacola Fla She talked from the shade of a university building far from the altar where the Pope was to celebrate a mass Im going to stay here and listen and go out in the sun again only for communion By the time the mass got underway rain was falling on those gathered in the field Unlike the electrical storm in Miami Friday however it did not disrupt the service But by then the sun had taken its toll with hundreds of persons treated for heatrelated problems and a few dozen suffering from heart conditions carried by ambulance or medical helicopters to local hospitals for treatment Outside the Superdome vendors offered those filing inside a chance to cool down with frozen popesickles Louella Givens a fourth grade teacher from New Orleans bought one for her fiveyear old son Llewellyn Her views on the Pope seemed to reflect those of many American Catholics I think some of the things he says in terms of family life are unrealistic she said But that doesnt take away from my belief in this church or my intentions to stay in the church although he doesnt recognize our right to disagee I guess she continued Its like any other love affair there will be disagreements but that brings change and for the church to be effective there has to be change It cant stay in the 10th century By coincidence the Popes visit to New Orleans came as 4500 delegates to a convention of the National Association of Social Workers was concluding Issues that the Pope has forced on the church such as the role of women abortion family planning and homosexuality are issues that concern social workers who take a more practical course to addressing social ills said Octgavio Roco media coordinator for the national convention Therefore he said most of the delegates were not overly enthused by the papal visit The day began for the Pope at St Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square where tourists gravitate to sit in outdoor cafes drink cafe au lait and munch croissants and admire the picturesque 19th Century buildings enclosing the square The cathedral is said to be the oldest in the continental United States built in 1794 when Louisiana was a French terroritory This morning the French Quarter was closed to traffic for the parade that followed the cathedral visit with the Pope in his white vestments waving to spectators lining the streets only one or two deep in many places from inside his glassenclosed truck Paul Shobert a computer programmer was enjoying the parade in typical Madris Gras fashion He and his friends had beer and screwdriver cocktails in large cups stuffed into a sixpack of Corona Extra Light Its even the Popes colors Mr Shobert said pointing to the yellow and white carrying case Its my Portable Pope Bar he added Officer Al Niessen of the an Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office said People in this city love a party and they love a parade Yeah he added when the last payment is made on a refrigerator people here will have a party and a parade
Judge Bork Comes to Judgment,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/opinion/judge-bork-comes-to-judgment.html,Of course the Senate should scrutinize the views of Judge Robert Bork President Reagans nominee for the Supreme Court The Administrations pious protests aside that would not inject politics into the judicial process Politics is already there  put there by the Constitution which says appointments shall be made by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate What the Senate will have to decide starting with hearings this week is not whether politics is involved but which kind high or low Vehement advocates on both sides are already heating up the battle Some opponents fear how a Justice Bork might rule on a specific issue like abortion rights Thats an understandable but narrow standard of judgment Others fear that his appointment would plunge the Supreme Court seesaw hard to the right Thats surely a proper consideration at some point Before reaching it however the senators must find out who Robert Bork is what he thinks the Courts job is and whether thats the kind of Supreme Court the Senate believes in Theres a vast written record to explore Over three decades  as an articulate and combative Yale professor Justice Department lawyer private practitioner and ambitious appellate judge  Judge Bork has fashioned an elaborate coherent theory about the Courts place in modern society That role can be briefly described much smaller especially concerning individual rights Those writings helped Judge Bork persuade the Administration that he was Ronald Reagans kind of judge To win confirmation he must persuade the Senate that his views are not as stark as those same writings suggest The Administration already labors to show that he is not a rightwing radical but a moderate conservative in the tradition of the admired Justice Lewis Powell whom he would replace Yet the written record summons Judge Bork to answer many concerns One involves his views of liberty and privacy The Senate may not properly ask how the nominee would vote in a specific case Yet it would be reasonable to ask for example why he feels that the 1973 abortion decision was not simply wrong but unconstitutional  indeed was a serious and wholly unjustifiable usurpation of state legislative authority The Senate must ask itself if not the nominee does such urgent sentiment mean he would vote to overrule the 1973 decision reviving statebystate agitation Judge Bork has objected heatedly to the Courts 1965 decision striking down a Connecticut law against contraception By the same logic does he think that a state may compel contraception In the current climate of AIDS hysteria that is more than a farfetched hypothesis Is there more to his judicial agenda He has suggested that dozens of precedents need correction When an interviewer asked whether he could identify any Supreme Court doctrines that deserved reconsideration he replied Yes I can but I wont Other questions need study Americans have long venerated the doctrine of Justices Holmes and Brandeis that strong even offensive language is constitutionally protected unless it poses imminent danger In 1979 Mr Bork found a terrifying frivolity in Holmess statement about a free marketplace of ideas and complained that the doctrine had a strange solicitude for subversive speech Over the years Judge Bork has vehemently opposed a Federal law desegregating lunch counters He has resisted interpretations finding support for equal rights for women in the Constitution and he has opposed the Equal Rights Amendment What view of these rights does he hold today and how long has he held them As Acting Attorney General in 1973 he dismissed the Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox on orders from President Nixon Does he still hold that the President had the right to issue that order however illicit the purpose Is his vision of executive power still so reverent Judge Bork a man of learning and sophistication may respond candidly to these concerns and the record already mountainous wont be complete until he does Nor will it be complete until opponents and other witnesses have spoken and the nominee has a chance to respond Whether Robert Bork deserves confirmation may depend on how plausibly he can explain that record
REPUBLICAN HOPEFULS COURT ABORTION FOES IN IOWA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/republican-hopefuls-court-abortion-foes-in-iowa.html,Republican Presidential contenders aware of the crucial role that Iowas wellorganized antiabortion forces could play in the states precinct caucuses next February courted voters here today at a statewide meeting of Iowans for Life Senator Bob Dole of Kansas Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and the Rev Pat Robertson all spoke at the antiabortion groups annual meeting vying for the endorsement of its political action committee Vice President Bush did not appear in person but Representative Tom Tauke of Iowa read a letter on his behalf All the candidates said basically what the groups supporters were waiting to hear that they opposed abortion and supported President Reagans nomination to the Supreme Court of Judge Robert H Bork whom they consider a foe of abortion Mr Kemp drew applause from the audience of about 350 people when he predicted that Judge Bork would be confirmed by the Senate next month and he sharply criticized Democrats for opposing the nomination The Congressman pledged that as President he would appoint prolife profamily conservative judges to all the courts in America Move to Bar Abortions Both Mr Robertson and Mr Bush in his letter endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion Mr Dole took a different approach While strongly declaring his opposition to abortion he asserted that he was the one candidate among those who appeared here today who could be elected Because if someone on the other side wins your marches are going to be longer and colder and it will be a steeper hill to climb said Mr Dole Instead of addressing the antiabortion group Mr Bush chose to march in a parade in Marshalltown about 50 miles from here He later told a crowd at the centennial celebration of the Iowa Veterans Home that as President he would provide steadiness character and courage In recent weeks supporters of Mr Dole Mr Bush Mr Robertson and Mr Kemp in particular have sought to win the backing of the states antiabortion forces whose blessing is regarded as critical in a race among several Republican conservatives Abortion Opponents Split But while the antiabortion forces have provided critical help to candidates in the past the picture has been muddied in the state this year as a result of an acrimonious battle that has split the antiabortion movement into two warring camps Last year Iowans for Life the group that founded the movement in the state in the 1970s filed a lawsuit against a rival organization an affiliate of the National Right to Life Committee Among other things Iowans for Life accused the rival group the Iowa Right to Life Committee of entering its offices in 1986 and removing files mailing lists and even the telephones as a result of a dispute over the leadership of the organization Mr Kemp has spent more time and energy than any of the other contenders in seeking the support of the antiabortion groups Two years ago he flew to Iowa to make a personal appearance before Iowans for Life a move that earned him a broad following among the groups members Today he furnished a bus to provide free transportation to a rally this evening for Republican Presidential contenders on the campus of Iowa State University at Ames Mr Kemps work appeared to pay off in the results of a straw poll taken among those who attended the antiabortion forum Mr Kemp received 37 percent of the ballots cast Mr Robertson 31 percent Mr Dole 17 percent and 8 percent were divided among several candidates none of whom received more than 1 percent including Mr Bush In addition 7 percent said they were undecided It is not clear what effect the split among antiabortion forces will have on the caucuses Carolyn Thompson a registered nurse who is a founding member of Iowans for Life says she believes only her organization which lists 15000 members has the kind of broad grassroots support that will be able to influence caucus decisions next year But at the same time she warned that a decision by the rival organization to endorse a candidate could backfire among members of her group If National Right to Life were to endorse Kemp she said it could be the kiss of death for our people Mrs Thompson said some of her groups supporters refused in 1986 to distribute campaign fliers on behalf of the reelection of Gov Terry E Branstad a Republican whom the group endorsed and supported because the materials were printed and paid for by the Iowa Right to Life Committee Mrs Thompson called Mr Kemps position on abortion fantabulous But she said she and some of the others who sit on the organizations 40member board were not yet convinced that he could be elected
"Robert Bork's Views on a Wide Range of Legal Issues, in His Own Words",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/robert-bork-s-views-on-a-wide-range-of-legal-issues-in-his-own-words.html,Following are excerpts from writings speeches and court opinions by Judge Robert H Bork on a range of issues ON THE SUPREME COURT We have a Court which is creating individual rights which are not to be found in the Constitution by any standard method of interpretation The Court itself from time to time admits that and more significantly the defenders of the Courts performance admit it What the courts are doing  is in fact to create new constitutional values which are nothing more than the imposition of uppermiddleclass values on the society The liberty of free men among other things is the liberty to make laws which is increasingly being denied  1982 speech to the Yale University Federalist Society ON ABORTION Roe v Wade is an unconstitutional decision a serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority I also think that Roe v Wade is by no means the only example of such unconstitutional behavior by the Supreme Court  Without any warrant in the Constitution the courts have required so many basic and unsettling changes in American life and government that a political response was inevitable  1981 Senate testimony on pending legislation ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Justice Powells middle position  universities may not use raw racial quotas but may consider race among other factors in the interest of diversity among the student body  has been praised as a statesmanlike solution to an agonizing problem It may be Unfortunately in constitutional terms his argument is not ultimately persuasive Mr Justice Brennans opinion for the fourmember bloc that approved racial quotas fares no better The argument offends both ideas of common justice and the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of equal protection to persons not classes  1978 OpEd article in The Wall Street Journal ON WAR POWERS I think there is no reason to doubt that President Nixon had ample constitutional authority to order the attack upon the sanctuaries in Cambodia seized by North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces That authority arises both from the inherent powers of the Presidency and from Congressional authorization The real question in this situation is whether Congress has the constitutional authority to limit the Presidents discretion with respect to this attack Any detailed intervention by Congress in the conduct of the Vietnamese conflict constitutes a trespass upon powers the Constitution reposes exclusively in the President This conclusion in no way detracts from Congresss war powers for that body retains control of the issue of war or peace  Remarks at a 1971 symposium As expiation for Vietnam we have the War Powers Resolution an attempt by Congress to share in detailed decisions about the deployment of US armed forces in the world It is probably unconstitutional and certainly unworkable  1978 OpEd article in The Wall Street Journal ON ANTITRUST AND CONGRESS Congress as a whole is institutionally incapable of the sustained rigorous and consistent thought that the fashioning of a rational antitrust policy requires No group of that size could accomplish the task Large bodies simply do not reason coherently together Congress could for example adopt a useful general goal in the Sherman Act It proved unable to supply sensible specifics in the Clayton and RobinsonPatman Acts  The Antitrust Paradox1978 ON LIBEL AND ORIGINAL INTENT The law of the First Amendment must not try to make public dispute safe and comfortable for all the participants That would only stifle the debate The American press is extraordinarily free and vigorous as it should be  Yet the area in which legal doctrine is currently least adequate to preserve press freedom is the area of defamation law Judge Scalias dissent implies that the idea of evolving constitutional doctrine should be anathema to judges who adhere to a philosophy of judicial restraint But  when there is a known principle to be explicated the evolution of doctrine is inevitable In a case like this it is the task of the judge in this generation to discern how the framers values defined in the context of the world they knew apply to the world we know The world changes in which unchanging values find their application If over time the libel action becomes a threat to the central meaning of the First Amendment why should not judges adapt their doctrines A judge who refuses to see new threats to an established constitutional value and hence provides a crabbed interpretation that robs a provision of its full fair and reasonable meaning fails in his judicial duty  Concurring opinion in Ollman v Evans 1984
Judge Bork: Restraint vs. Activism,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/judge-bork-restraint-vs-activism.html,The fierce political battle over Judge Robert H Bork now moving toward contentious Senate hearings has been marked by sharply contrasting images of what he really stands for and what he would do if confirmed for the Supreme Court Is he the exponent of politically neutral judicial restraint that he claims to be  one who would respect even those precedents of which he disapproves Or is he a rightwing activist who would uproot decades of settled precedent and write his own political views into the law for decades to come With Senate hearings on his nomination set to begin on Tuesday conservative hopes and liberal fears that Judge Bork could usher in a historic turn to the right are reaching fever pitch Years of Expanding Individual Rights Many partisans on both sides say that if the Senate accepts President Reagans nomination of Judge Bork it could lead to reversal of many years of expansion of civil rights and civil liberties and move the Court  more evenly divided than in many decades  in a more conservative direction on many other issues The confusion has been fed both by the complexity of the man and by caricatures of his views by some of the more partisan advocates on both sides of the confirmation fight 25 Years of a Distinctive Philosophy White House lobbyists for example have asserted in briefing papers for senators that the 60yearold nominee is a moderate who would not change the Courts balance in any way and would be much like the pragmatic and pivotal Justice Lewis F Powell Jr whom he would replace That has provoked derision from both conservative and liberal legal experts On the other hand some opponents such as Senator Edward M Kennedy have painted this exceptionally intelligent witty and charming man as an extremist who would allow policestate abuses racism sexism and censorship to rage unchecked Close study of Judge Borks record  25 years of expounding his distinctive philosophy conservative legal views and forceful criticisms of the modern activist liberal Supreme Court  offers some support for the widely differing opinions about him A review by The New York Times of his writings speeches testimony published interviews and five years as a Federal appeals court judge here since 1982 supports these conclusions  On constitutional law  issues including civil rights civil liberties and the separation of government powers  there is little doubt that Judge Bork would move the Court sharply to the right He has scornfully repudiated as not merely wrong but illegitimate dozens of key Supreme Court decisions expanding individual rights since the 1920s at times seeming to suggest he would overrule them But some doubt remains over whether he would or could overrule many major precedents  The most salient aspects of his thought are a very broad view of state power to override certain individual freedoms such as privacy abortion and advocacy of civil disobedience opposition to egalitarian social reform an ardently freemarket probusiness approach to economic issues and commitment to broad Presidential powers relatively unrestrained by Congress and the judiciary  His complaint that the modern Court has too often rewritten the Constitution in the guise of interpreting it is more powerfully reasoned and has more respectable historical and scholarly antecedents than critics who dismiss him as an extremist would like to admit  Although Judge Bork has often assailed Supreme Court Justices for reading their own political and moral views into the law he has seemed sometimes to do the same thing Nobody can predict with certainty how much Judge Borks views might change how he would vote on issues he has not previously addressed or whether as he has suggested recently he would hesitate as a Justice to overrule the precedents he has so scathingly denounced But his past provides both a fully articulated constitutional philosophy and a great deal of guidance as to what kind of Justice he would be Bork Versus The Modern Court Perhaps the most striking aspect of Judge Borks writings and speeches since the late 1960s is his vehement denunciation repeated over many years of Supreme Court decisions representing much of the legal evolution since the 1920s In a 1982 speech he said a large proportion of the most significant constitutional decisions of the past three decades could not have been reached through legitimate means of constitutional interpretation Over the years he has often used epithets like unconstitutional illegitimate utterly specious pernicious and judicial imperialism to describe dozens of Supreme Court decisions expanding the rights of individuals and minority groups He has assailed not only the opinions of liberal Justices of the Warren Court but also many that were written and joined by more conservative judges like John Marshall Harlan and Justice Powell Creating New Rights The constant theme of his attacks has been that these Justices have usurped the powers of state and Federal elected officials by writing their own upper middle class political and moral views into the law to create new rights with no basis in the Constitution The precedents he has assailed make a long list beginning with those recognizing a right to privacy in intimate sexual and family relations including the rights of married couples to use contraceptives and of women to have abortions He has also criticized rulings that required one man one vote as a basis for legislative reapportionment that approved affirmative action efforts for racial minorities that outlawed poll taxes racially restrictive deed covenants and forced sterilization of criminals and that expanded judicial power to hear the grievances of advocacy groups and others Judge Bork has said that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws was intended to bar only racial ethnic and religious discrimination The Supreme Court has thus erred he says in its decisions striking down laws that discriminate against groups that were historically not intended to be protected including women illegitimate children aliens and politically powerless or unpopular minorities generally He has assailed the Courts radical expansion of the First Amendment since the 1950s in particular its protection of sexually explicit speech and much artistic and literary expression and a long line of decisions protecting abstract advocacy of civil disobedience or revolution as long as there is no clear and present danger of illegal action Disobedience and the Law The clear and present danger rule grew out of stirring dissents by Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis more than 60 years ago that are among the cornerstones of modern First Amendment law Judge Bork however has called them deficient in logic and analysis as well as in history Under his view the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr could have been criminally prosecuted for supporting sitins at segregated lunch counters and similar violations of local laws however unjust the laws At the same time Judge Bork has assailed as contrary to the First Amendment the Courts approval of some Congressional limits on campaign spending and he has called for greater judicial protection of defendants in libel cases He has criticized the Court for overly expansive and rigidly secularist enforcement of the First Amendments prohibition of the establishment of religion and its guarantee of religious freedom And he has advocated reintroduction of some religion into public schools and some greater religious symbolism in our public life Many other prominent constitutional scholars share Judge Borks doubts about some of these decisions in particular the Courts 1973 ruling that abortion is a constitutional right and they respect the force of his arguments even when they disagree What makes him stand out is the vehemence as well as the eloquence with which he has for many years condemned such a sweeping array of major decisions that have become settled law and the confidence with which he has often suggested that his is the only intellectually respectable position Since he became a Federal appeals court judge in 1982 he has muted his attacks on the Supreme Court precedents and he has acknowledged his obligation as a lower court judge to abide by its precedents But Judge Bork himself said in a 1985 interview that my views have remained about what they were and he has continued to criticize Supreme Court precedents The Majoritys Right To Impose Its View More than any nominee in recent decades Judge Bork is the representative and leader of a school of thought He has worked out an overarching legal and constitutional philosophy that he says should govern all judicial decisionmaking A repeated theme is the majoritys legitimate right to govern and to impose its views of morality on dissident individuals or minorities subject only to the handful of specific individual rights explicitly listed in the Constitution and its amendments Judge Bork has complained that this liberty of the majority is increasingly being denied by the Courts creation of new rights for individuals such as the right to privacy in intimate sexual and family matters Thus he has argued the Courts more expansive extrapolations from vaguely worded provisions of the Bill of Rights have been antidemocratic and unprincipled based not on the Constitution in any real sense but on the personal political and moral values of the Justices He has repudiated the prevailing view among many modern constitutional scholars such as Archibald Cox that the Supreme Court has a special role to play in cautiously expanding individual freedoms protecting politically powerless minorities and fostering social reform by incrementally extending the reasoning of its own past decisions To the contrary Judge Bork says unelected and politically unaccountable judges should serve the more modest function of deriving neutral principles of law from the original intent of those who adopted the Constitution and state and Federal legislation He calls this approach interpretivism or intentionalism His intellectually powerful attacks on judicial imperialists echo in some ways the complaints about judicial usurpations of power made by for almost 200 years by leaders including Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D Roosevelt But unlike them Judge Bork has al a at times spoken disparagingly of the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights and called for exceedingly narrow interpretations of them In a 1971 article he said that the First Amendment like the rest of the Bill of Rights appears to have been a hastily drafted document on which little thought was expended and that the framers did not display a strong libertarian stance with respect to speech He added Neither the text nor the legislative history of the amendment tells us much of value today On the other hand Judge Bork has been quite protective of some categories of political speech and has sometimes emphasized that courts must be energetic to protect the rights of individuals in particular the First Amendment freedoms of speech and the press He has said his version of the original intention theory is flexible enough to allow rights to evolve to take account of changing social circumstances and technology Thus he argued in a 1984 libel opinion hailed by many press lawyers and liberals that First Amendment restraints on libel suits should be tightened because of the danger such suits posed to free speech even if the framers did not intend to curb libel suits at all Judicial Restraint Or Conservative Goals A central issue in the debate is whether Judges Bork practices the kind of judicial restraint he preaches or rather seeks to write his own moral and political views into the law as he has accused the Supreme Court of doing Judge Bork has often said that his political views are irrelevant to his legal arguments and judicial decisions Regardless he is clearly an ardent political conservative on many issues in which law and politics cannot easily be disentangled In speeches over the years he has talked in urgent tones of the need for conservatives and business leaders to mount an intellectual struggle to combat the leveling impulses of egalitarianism and populism and the threats to the corporate system posed by leftliberal academics journalists and other intellectuals He has lamented the transformation of the nation into a highly regulated welfare state plagued by massive income distributions and a socially permissive popular culture wallowing in barren individualistic hedonism Support for Executive Branch There is some evidence that Judge Borks political preferences influence his legal positions in ways not easily categorized as instances of judicial restraint A key example is Judge Borks strikingly consistent record both as a judge and earlier of supporting the executive branch and in particular the Reagan Administration in increasingly fierce battles with Congress for the upper hand In contrast to his arguments that the Supreme Court may not thwart the legislative will by recognizing individual rights that are not clearly spelled out in the Constitution he has cited the vague separation of powers principles implicit in the structure of the Constitution as a mandate for judges to strike down restrictions on the executive branch As a scholar he denounced as violations of the separation of powers such limitations on the President as the War Powers Act independent special prosecutors and legislation against espionagerelated wiretapping in the United States without a judicial warrant As a judge he has taken every opportunity to dismiss on procedural grounds lawsuits by those challenging executive actions in one case he argued that the Senate had no standing to challenge President Reagans nullification of a law even if the procedure he used had been improper Views on Antitrust Law Judge Borks writings on antitrust law his academic specialty when he was a Yale law professor also contrast markedly with the judicial deference to legislative judgments that he advocates in other contexts In an influential 1978 book his major scholarly work he denounced as wrong and economically counterproductive most of the antitrust laws passed by Congress along with the vast majority of the Supreme Courts decisions on antitrust issues in this century which he has called thoroughly perverse The main point of his argument was that antitrust law has been moving in the wrong direction since 1911 And he criticized as economically inefficient most antitrust rules that protect small businesses and limit big mergers and some other practices by big companies such as prohibitions that companies impose on price discounting by independent retailers Some antitrust provisions passed by Congress Mr Bork wrote are so economically senseless and incoherent that courts cannot enforce them in a principled way and thus should never enforce them at all Some scholars who admire Judge Borks antitrust writings nonetheless find this almost contemptuous attitude toward duly enacted laws difficult to square with the deference to democratic choice that he cites in supporting for example the right of the majority to ban contraception Judge Bork and his supporters reject charges that he is a conservative judicial activist and today the Justice Department released a 213page response to his critics Angering Political Conservatives It pointed out that both as a judge and as Solicitor General from 1973 to 1977 Mr Bork has taken relatively liberal positions in some civil rights cases and that he has taken some other positions that angered many political conservatives One example was Mr Borks public position several years ago when many conservatives were pushing for legislation to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over such matters as abortion and school prayer that such legislation would be unwise and perhaps unconstitutional The Justice Department document also emphasized that Judge Bork had joined with liberal colleagues on the appeals courts to reach unanimous decisions in the vast majority of all his cases often enforcing the rights of workers upholding regulations of business and the like Critics respond that as Judge Bork himself has said most of the cases before the appeals court are decided unanimously and have little ideological content Some critics have compiled detailed studies concluding that in the more than 50 split decisions in which he has participated Judge Bork has pursued a conservative probusiness agenda rather than any neutral theory of judicial restraint In some of these cases more liberal colleagues on the appeals court have in their opinions accused Judge Bork of judicial activism  in one case for example of creating new property rights for business virtually out of thin air Bork as a Justice How Would He Act With the Supreme Court more closely divided on major issues than it has been in 50 years Judge Bork could clearly make an enormous difference if he sought to narrow or overrule the many constitutional decisions he has criticized The biggest question mark is how much he would be restrained by the Courts history of respect for and adherence to precedent That is likely to be a key focus of questioning during his Senate testimony In public remarks in January Judge Bork said Certainly at the least I would think an originalist judge would have no problem whatever in overruling a nonoriginalist precedent because that precedent by the very basis of his judicial philosophy has no legitimacy He qualified this statement only by saying that judges are not absolutely free to overrule incorrect precedents especially if the effect would be to uproot our entire government and society The only example he gave of precedents that should be respected were those upholding broad Federal power to regulate commerce In 1982 confirmation hearings on his nomination to the appeals court Judge Bork did assure the senators saying I think the value of precedent and of certainty and continuity in the law is so high that I think a judge ought not to overturn prior decisions unless he is absolutely clear that the prior decision was wrong and perhaps pernicious But because he has denounced a great number of major decisions as wrong and pernicious the logic of this statement might not restrain him quite as much as the tone seems to suggest Another question is how the views of the 60yearold jurist which changed substantially when he was younger might evolve in the rarified atmosphere of the Supreme Court as old issues come up in new contexts and new issues continually bubble up from below One Justice mused about this in his office this summer When you get this damned job my nothing youve ever really done before prepares you for it he said
ROBERTSON REIGNS AT G.O.P. FACE-OFF,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/us/robertson-reigns-at-gop-face-off.html,What was billed as the first real faceoff among Republican Presidential candidates turned into a rally tonight for the Rev Pat Robertson who brought hundreds of supporters to a sports arena here won an enthusiastic reception and dominated the encounter The meeting billed as the Presidential Cavalcade of Stars marked the first time that Vice President Bush the leader in the Republican polls had consented to appear on the same platform as his major challengers Senator Bob Dole of Kansas Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York Mr Robertson and Pierre S du Pont 4th the former Governor of Delaware With shouts and cheers bands and balloons and waving placards the meeting at the sports arena of Iowa State University had the flavor of a national convention And the candidates campaigned as if it were scurrying for votes in a straw poll that had become a test of organizational strength Nearly 6000 Tickets Sold The campaigns paid 25 a ticket to give their supporters the right to cast ballots By late this evening nearly 6000 tickets had been sold about half of them in the last 24 hours before the meeting Although the results of the straw poll would not be known until late tonight Mr Robertsons supporters were among the heaviest lastminute buyers Republican organizers said The result is that Mr Robertson appeared to have the loudest and possibly the biggest contingent in the hall Republican officials conceded that he succeeded in his goal of using a strong showing to signal the seriousness of his cause and the power of his churchbased political organization Even before the ballots were counted aides to Mr Bush were discounting the significance of the vote in which the strong Bush organization expected to do well George Wittgraf head of Mr Bushs Iowa campaign said the straw poll was only a measure of whether you were able to get more people in one place on Saturday night He noted that President Reagan had lost a straw poll in 1979 Mr Reagan also lost the Iowa caucuses in 1980 Charles Black the director of Mr Kemps campaign said of Mr Robertson What hes done is very impressive But Mr Black said that Mr Robertsons success in dominating the meeting doesnt show any mass appeal for a caucus or primary Marlene Elwell the Midwest coordinator for Mr Robertsons campaign estimated that from 1300 to 1500 Robertson supporters had attended the meeting many on church buses One couple said they had driven six hours today from South Dakota to attend the meeting Announcement by Robertson The meeting though not a debate gave the Republican candidates a chance to emphasize the central themes of their campaigns and indirectly the differences among them But with the exception of Mr du Pont who attacked Mr Dole Mr Bush and Mr Kemp for seeking to avoid the issues frontrunners run from things he said the candidates preferred to criticize the Democrats or say nothing ill about anyone Mr Robertson indicated strongly that he would announce his candidacy next Thursday and to loud cheering built his address around the question Who are the people supporting this man Those who support him Mr Robertson said tell me that in their view Communism is tyranny and call for the ultimate downfall of Communist tyranny everywhere in the world including the Soviet Union He added They tell me they want to work for a nation that supports the family where husbands love their wives and wives love their husbands and where children can once again pray in the schools of America This brought a resounding cheer from his backers They want us to give our children education in a drugfree crime free school environment he declared They tell me that progressive education in our land is growing progressively worse Noisy Demonstration Mr Robertson denounced abortion and attacked the cultural relativism of John Dewey the educational theorist of the Progressive era urging instead that moral values be restored to the schools When he concluded with a call for one nation under God his supporters broke into a noisy demonstration throwing confetti as a makeshift campaign band played the theme music from the movie Rocky Among the other candidates Mr Bush and Mr Dole gave conservative speeches that nonetheless sounded significantly more liberal than those of any of the other contenders Mr Bush for example said referring to the Democrats I refuse to surrender the high ground of compassion for the disadvantaged to those whose only answer is the giveaway He also picked up on a theme popular among Democrats by criticizing the failure on Wall Street as it is in Washington to live up to traditional ethical standards Mr Dole emphasized his Midwestern roots and his special links to Iowans and he repeatedly declared that he was the most electable Republican Mr du Pont whose campaign is based on bold proposals to abolish farm subsidies and require all welfare recipients to work critized his adversaries as fromrunners who run from reality and fear controversy Mr Kemp who spoke first gave an inspirational address filled with alliterative references to the Republican Party which he called the party of populism progress and prosperity Denouncing the Democrats as advocates of pacificism protectionism isolationism and pain Mr Kemp cited Franklin D Roosevelts formula that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself He declared Todays Democratic candidates have only one thing to offer Fear itself

"Stakes of the Bork Fight; With Senate Hearings Starting Tomorrow, Both Sides Have Much to Gain or to Lose",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/us/stakes-bork-fight-with-senate-hearings-starting-tomorrow-both-sides-have-much.html,The Senate battle over the confirmation of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court which formally begins Tuesday when Judge Bork goes before the Judiciary Committee holds the potential for enormous political gain or peril for many of those involved Coming at a crucial moment both in the history of the Supreme Court and in the national political cycle President Reagans nomination of one of the countrys best known conservative legal scholars has galvanized the entire ideological spectrum like no other in recent memory The fact that four Senators are running for President only adds fuel to an atmosphere that would be highly charged in any event because of its inevitable focus on issues such as abortion and school prayer The four include the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware who opposes the nomination and whose conduct of the hearings which are expected to last two or three weeks and be nationally televised may well determine his political future and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader of the Senate who is making his support of Judge Bork a centerpiece of his Presidential bid Ideology Seen as Valid Concern Recent polls show the public closely divided on the nomination but receptive to the argument of Judge Borks opponents that it is valid for the Senate to consider a nominees philosophy and not just academic or professional credentials A New York TimesCBS News poll in late July for example indicated that 62 percent believed senators should pay a lot of attention to a nominees position on major constitutional issues Judge Borks opponents were buoyed by several developments last week First there was an unusual amount of dissent within the American Bar Association committee that reviewed the nomination Ten members gave Judge Bork the highest rating wellqualified but four found him not qualified and one member voted not opposed Then a poll by the Scripps Howard News Service showed considerable opposition to the nomination in the South Moderate to conservative Southern Democrats including Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee another of the Presidential candidates are a key element in the undecided bloc in the Senate The executive committee of the New York City Bar Association voted 14 to 4 to oppose Judge Bork saying his judicial philosophy is counter to many of the fundamental rights and liberties protected by the Constitution In addition a poll commissioned by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees a labor union that is opposing the nomination found that 51 percent of people who were provided with details of Judge Borks record said they were inclined to disapprove of the nomination with 15 percent saying they would be likely to support confirmation Senator Biden seeking to blunt Republican criticism of the 11week delay between the nomination and the start of confirmation hearings has promised to send the nomination to the full Senate by the first week of October A filibuster by Judge Borks opponents may develop but in any event a lengthy debate on the Senate floor is virtually certain There is no chance that The Supreme Court will have a full complement when its fall term begins Oct 5 Committee Role Emphasized While there will apparently not be an effort to kill the nomination in committee the panels role is nonetheless viewed by both sides as crucial The opponents hope to send the nomination to the Senate floor with a negative recommendation or at least with no recommendation a development they believe would put Judge Borks supporters on the defensive and make it easier for undecided senators to vote no Further the confirmation hearings can shape the publics image not only of Judge Bork but of the senators involved in the debate and to the extent that the issue becomes a test of party loyalty of the political parties themselves If the nominee comes across as a thoughtful mainstream conservative his opponents may be vulnerable to the charge of conducting an unprecedented ideological inquisition as Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who will be one of Judge Borks main defenders on the Judiciary Committee said Thursday on the Senate floor Independent Voters at Stake On the other hand if the public sees him as a threatening extremist then it is his supporters who risk being seen as the ideologues with his opponents welcomed as defenders of the constitutional status quo With both political parties competing for the allegiance of the independent voters who hold the balance in the 1988 elections these perceptions could have ramifications beyond the fate of the nomination itself Senator Biden himself has warned that the effort to defeat the nomination if not handled carefully could hurt the Democrats by reviving the image that the party is struggling to shed that of being captive to special interest groups But the battle is scarcely riskfree for the Republicans with polls indicating that the public does not support the Reagan agenda on the socalled social issues such as abortion Judge Bork has been sharply critical of Supreme Court rulings legalizing abortion and limiting the role of religion in public life If Judge Bork comes to be seen as the virtual personification of the Reagan social agenda  the image his opponents are working hard to convey then support for the nomination could alienate moderate voters in the 1988 elections Become a Lightning Rod The 60yearold Federal appeals court judge has become a lightning rod for those already committed to either side of the longrunning debates over race religion the scope of personal privacy and the status of women All are questions on which the Court is now closely divided Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr whom Judge Bork would succeed often cast the deciding vote most notably in a series of rulings that rejected the Reagan Administrations efforts to limit the scope of affirmative action programs The Administration and its allies see Judge Borks confirmation as their best if not last chance to leave a lasting imprint on American life Judge Bork a former law professor and Solicitor General in the Nixon Administration has criticized many landmark Supreme Court decisions expanding individual rights President Reagan who named him to the appeals court here in 1981 has called Judge Borks confirmation his top domestic priority Judge Bork has also been endorsed by a broad crosssection of the legal establishment including Lloyd N Cutler the White House counsel under President Carter and Associate Justice John Paul Stevens a moderate on the Supreme Court who often joins the liberal wing in key cases He also has the strong backing of conservative organizations including Moral Majority which delivered 20000 proconfirmation postcards to the judiciary committee last week 50Year Rule Repealed On the other side is a loosely organized coalition of hundreds of organizations including traditional civil rights organizations womens groups and labor organizations including the AFLCIO Organizers say the coalition is the largest ever to be mobilized for any Capitol Hill batle Many of the groups are liberal but a number are essentially apolitical and some have rarely been involved in efforts of this kind The American Civil Liberties Union repealed a 50yearold rule of neutrality to enable it to oppose the nomination Some prominent lawyers have also come out against the nomination Clark Clifford a dean of the Washington bar is serving as a consultant to Senator Biden and endorsed a highly critical analysis of Judge Borks record that Senator Biden issued early this month The opponents portray the battle in sweeping terms The Senate vote could be as important as a Presidential election with respect to the longterm consequences for the country said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights itself a coalition of some 200 organizations that has taken a leading role in the opposition The opponents plan to stress what they see as the overall impact if Judge Borks views became the law of the land It cant be just a few issues said Melanne Verveer director of public policy for People for the American Way an active opposition group The public is always willing to say Well you cant be right on everything Its up to us to show a pattern Both sides expect Judge Bork himself to be a highly effective witness articulate even witty with a commanding knowledge of the subjects under discussion Our strategy Bob Bork is the strategy Senator Hatch told reporters this week During the summer Judge Bork was accessible both to senators and to an unusual degree the news media usually coming across as thoughtful and openminded Many of Judge Borks most controversial views on civil rights free speech religion and privacy are contained in his articles and speeches His supporters contend that those are less relevant than his judicial opinions As a law professor he was paid to be provocative Senator Hatch said adding that on the bench Judge Bork has been a mainstream quintessential jurist The White House has deemphasized Judge Borks views on civil rights and abortion A recent 5page White House mailing to editorial writers which was labeled as an overview of Judge Borks qualifications and philosophy discussed only one substantive area criminal justice a subject on which Judge Bork differs little from Justice Powell The opponents say that as a lowercourt judge Judge Bork had no choice but to apply legal precedent to the cases before him while the real clues to his thinking are to be found in his nonjudicial writing Their effort at the hearings will be to get as much about Judge Borks views into the record as possible Once his record and views are revealed people will turn against him said Nan Aron director of the Alliance for Justice one of the leading opposition groups We intend to let Judge Bork be Bork and speak for himself said Morton Halperin the head of the American Civil Liberties Unions Washington office The 14member Judiciary Committee with eight Democrats and six Republicans is likely to be closely divided Analysts on both sides say there are five solid Republican votes for Judge Bork and five Democrats either solidly against him or leaning strongly in that direction This group includes Senator Paul Simon of Illinois a rival of Senator Bidens for the Democratic Presidential nominaion That leaves four swing votes one Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and three Democrats Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the majority leader who has publicly cautioned his fellow Democrats against rushing to judgment on the nomination and Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona Opponents were cheered this week when Senator DeConcini said in a newspaper interview that he had serious questions about Judge Borks record and could not vote now comfortably A spokesman for Senator DeConcini said the remark had come in answer to a hypothetical question and that the senator would not make up his mind until the hearings were over

IN THE NATION; Bork At the Bar,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/opinion/in-the-nation-bork-at-the-bar.html,As the Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings on Robert Bork whats to be made of the ease with which another Reagan nominee Judge William S Sessions sailed through his confirmation hearings before that same committee Democrats and Republicans conservatives and liberals fell all over themselves to praise him Both the committee and the Senate clearly will approve him as the new director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation although Judge Sessions is unquestionably a conservative and has earned a reputation as a tough lawandorder man But colleagues in the Western District of Texas consider him eminently fair and reasonable To some extent of course Democrats and liberals on the committee anticipating the criticism theyll receive during hearings on the bitterly contested Bork nomination  were trying to show they could be nonpartisan toward a conservative and a Reagan nominee The head of the FBI moreover while always in a sensitive position is not so controversial a nominee as one who could change the character of the Supreme Court Senator Edward Kennedy had a point though when he said that in nominating Judge Sessions the Reagan Administration has shown that it knows how to choose a conservative for high office who has broad respect and support in Congress Suppose as Mr Kennedy wishfully suggested Mr Reagan had nominated Judge Sessions instead of Judge Bork for the Supreme Court That plus the sitting Justices Rehnquist White OConnor and Scalia still would have provided a reasonably clear conservative majority on the Court Would a Sessions nomination for the Supreme Court have been welcomed as heartily by Judiciary Committee Democrats as one for the FBI directorship Of course not because most of them would have been opposed to the rightward swing of the Court that his confirmation or that of any other conservative would have precipitated perhaps for years to come On the other hand its likely that Judge Sessions would have been confirmed for the Supreme Court fairly easily  as Antonin Scalia was last year  because there would have been little reason beyond straightout partisanship for anyone to vote against him At least on important nominations senators like to appear above that kind of thing Some are Judge Bork on the other hand first before the committee later on the Senate floor  faces a severe test the most hostile since two of Richard Nixons Supreme Court nominees were defeated Judge Bork might conceivably be defeated too although that is by no means certain the odds probably remain in favor of a Presidential nominee Judge Bork might be defeated because unlike Judge Sessions he has given repeated indications over years of teaching writing and ruling that whatever his own and the Administrations insistence  he is neither a conventional conservative nor a conventional jurist These indications were reflected in the unusual split vote by which an American Bar Association panel gave Judge Bork its approval and in his rejection by the executive committee of the New York City Bar Association The questions about him center on judicial philosophy rather than on specific issues or even on conservatism in general He is opposed to abortion for instance but that would not be sufficient to defeat him even in company with other matters in which he differs substantively  as did Mr Scalia  with the present and past Supreme Courts One problem is that Judge Borks record suggests that he often has been indifferent toward individual rights when they conflict with government or powerful institutions Another is his disdainful opinions about how and on what grounds decisions like Roe v Wade were reached and whether his constitutional views are so fixed that he would neither have an open mind nor show the respect due the ideas of colleagues of different views What consideration would he show for precedents with which he profoundly disagrees as he has made plain in writings and rulings With his apparent talents would he try to lead the Court toward reversal of what many equally able jurists consider settled law These are the kinds of questions that threaten the Bork nomination not just his conservatism or his views on particular issues or even the swing of the Court his confirmation might bring about And its these questions that provide respectable ground even for evident partisans to stand upon in questioning Robert Borks fundamental qualifications for the Supreme Court

hushed courtroom today that when she first asked a highschool classmate to kill her father It didnt seem serious It was more like a game In more than 90 minutes of testimony at a presentencing hearing for the contractkilling of her father Miss Pierson  at times seemingly removed and at others times weeping  repeatedly referred to a rift in her life between reality and fantasy She said it was one of the ways she learned to cope with being forced into having sexual relations with her father It was an abusive relationship that she said began when she was about 12 years old with fondling in the long drives to visit her dying mother in the hospital Id put a pillow over my face Miss Pierson said at one point describing how she would deal with having sexual intercourse with her father And Id block it out until it was over In a day in which the details of the murder plot were raised for the first time Miss Pierson who pleaded guilty earlier this year described how she approached Sean Pica in their high school homeroom after the two discussed a newspaper article about a woman who had hired someone to kill her husband Who would be crazy enough to do that she said she asked Mr Pica adding that he told her that for the right price he would be willing to kill Yet even after agreeing to a price 1000  and being told by Mr Pica that the murder would definitely take place she testified today that when she actually discovered the body of her 42yearold father James lying in a pool of blood in the familys driveway on Feb 5 1986 she thought that he had slipped and fallen on the ice Miss Piersons paternal grandmother Virginia Pierson and her paternal aunt Marilyn Adams  neither of whom believe that Miss Pierson was sexually abused sat expressionless during her testimony Only at one point did Mrs Pierson say aloud I cant hear Miss Pierson who was clad in a simple white blouse and gray skirt was questioned only by her lawyer Paul Gianelli and once by Justice Harvey W Sherman who wanted to know whether her father actually called an abortion clinic after she said her father suspected she was pregnant with his child I dont think so said Miss Pierson who was pregnant at the time of her fathers murder Laboratory tests after a miscarriage showed that the father was not Mr Pierson but Miss Piersons boyfriend Robert Cuccio In a surprisingly unemotional manner Miss Pierson described how her father would force himself on her in the shower and how he explained that he was touching her because he loved her At first she went along with it she said because she originally thought it was a sign of her fathers affection When she finally realized it was wrong she said she passively acquiesced so he would not take his frustrations out on the rest of the family It was only after her mother died in February 1985 Miss Pierson said that she imagined she was aware of what was going on I figured if she was in heaven shed be watching us Miss Pierson said adding that to make amends with her mother she dedicated herself to watching over her sister JoAnn then 7 years old Miss Pierson has said she had her father killed because she became concerned that he was about to start abusing JoAnn Crossexamination of Miss Pierson which could be significant in determining how Justice Sherman will sentence her was postponed to allow the testimony of an expert witness on child abuse It was Miss Piersons conflict between reality and illusion that Dr Jean Goodwin a professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Wisconsin and a national authority on sexual abuse chose to focus on Dr Goodwin said that Miss Pierson was definitely a victim of sexual abuse and as such suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome Part of a Fantasy Life Such a condition would explain the revenge fantasies Miss Pierson had which Dr Goodwin said were common with the victims of sexual assault as well as the fact that she was often unable to tell what was really real She said that such a fantasy world was part of the coping process and that when Miss Pierson spoke to Mr Pica the discussion made her feel better and was part of her fantasy life Had Miss Pierson not found Mr Pica the murder she said most likely would not have occurred Asked by Mr Gianelli the defense lawyer whether Miss Pierson was the engineer of this crime Dr Goodwin said that to accuse Miss Pierson of such a role was to misunderstand her basic sense of unreality On crossexamination however Edward Jablonski the prosecutor took issue with the notion that Miss Pierson was an innocent bystander to a fantasy that got out of hand Assessing Control of the Crime He described how Miss Pierson Mr Cuccio and Mr Pica went to her fathers home and discussed specifically whether Mr Pica should use one of Mr Piersons guns in the murder Miss Pierson ultimately decided that none of Mr Piersons guns would be used Mr Jablonski said because the crime might then be traced to the family Mr Jablonski then described how moments after learning of her fathers death Miss Pierson sat at the kitchen table smiling and how she immediately stopped when a police officer walked into the room He also said that as the body of her father was being taken to an ambulance Miss Pierson was seen hugging kissing and laughing with her boyfriend Dr Goodwin who interviewed Miss Pierson for about five hours said that without asking Miss Pierson about those things or the officer who witnessed them it was impossible for her to comment Dr Goodwin said she was particularly interested in reading the letter to Justice Sherman from Miss Piersons sister JoAnn in which the girl said that Miss Pierson would go after her father It made me wonder what she had witnessed Dr Goodwin said The hearing is to resume Wednesday
THE PAPAL VISIT: WHEN MEDICAL PROGRESS AND THE CHURCH'S MORAL TEACHINGS MEET; Pope Warns Health Workers on Straying,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/15/us/papal-visit-when-medical-progress-church-s-moral-teachings-meet-pope-warns.html,Pope John Paul II today warned Roman Catholic healthcare workers concerned about the ethical dilemmas posed by medical progress that they must steadfastly reject abortion mercy killing and new reproductive technologies that violate the churchs moral teachings The church constantly proclaims and defends the dignity of human life from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death the Pope said before a gathering of 2000 executives and professionals of the nations 630 Catholic hospitals and hundreds of other healthcare institutions The Pope on the fifth day of his 10day visit to the United States also called on workers to show compassion and sensitivity to those suffering from AIDS which he called a crisis of immense proportions Popes Remarks on AIDS As you courageously affirm and implement your moral obligation and social responsibility to help those who suffer you are individually and collectively living out the parable of the Good Samaritan he said Traveling between sites and along a 25mile parade route the Pope saw generally thin crowds as thousands took to heart warnings about tight security and traffic nightmares which never materialized Later in the day the Pope spoke to an audience of 16000 American Indians many of them in native garb and feathered headdress and urged them not to dwell excessively on mistakes and wrongs of the Catholic colonists of the West but to work toward reconciliation Sitting in a handcarved wooden throne of Indian patterns he was given a blessing with an eagle feather and was circled by chanting Indian dancers He also offered a mass in the football stadium of Arizona State University in Tempe where he was introduced by the humor columnist Erma Bombeck After the homily he annointed 25 sick or disabled residents of Arizona who were wheeled up by Boy Scouts On Tuesday the Pope will travel to Los Angeles where he will meet with 1600 leaders of television film and journalism He will also answer questions of young people at the Universal Amphitheater and by teleconference in Portland Denver and St Louis In the evening he will celebrate mass at the Los Angeles Coliseum for an expected 100000 Catholics Catholic Workers Quandary The Popes address on health issues was delivered in response to a statement by John E Curley Jr president of the Catholic Health Association which told of the moral quandaries Catholic healthcare workers face in reconciling church teachings with such new trends as genetic manipulation human fertilization outside the mothers body and other novel reproductive techniques and lifesustaining methods Our nations healthcare environment increasingly poses ethical dilemmas that defy simple answers Mr Curley said warning that our ministry may well be placed in jeopardy if it cannot come to terms with such issues To that appeal the Pope reasserted the churchs teaching that condemns abortion and euthanasia including efforts to remove feeding equipment when families decide that a relatives life is no longer viable American church officials however have supported the removal of respirators in cases where it is felt that such medical equipment only postpones death The church the Pope said cannot fail to emphasize the need to safeguard the life and integrity of the human embryo and fetus At another point he spoke of the great evil of abortion and euthansia Tension but No Disagreement Mr Curley at a news conference later in the day said there were no disagreements between the Vatican and Catholic healthcare workers Rather he said he was speaking about the tension that results from the churchs attempt to adapt to new medical discoveries Some Catholic theologians and healthcare officials have taken stands that depart from strict Catholic teaching on such issues The role of Catholic hospitals was at issue in the Vaticans disciplining of Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle who had permitted sterilization for nonCatholics at a diocesan hospital Polls show that a sizable minority of Catholics though not a plurality believe that abortion should be permitted when pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest and when it is necessary to save the life of the mother Polls show similar disagreement on church stands on issues like surrogate motherhood In a New York TimesCBS News poll taken last month 74 percent of American Catholics said they believed that infertile married couples who use a surrogate mother to have a child can still be good Catholics while 16 percent disagreed In the face of some of this dissent the Vaticans Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith earlier this year issued a papallyapproved document on procreative technology It rejected any form of fertilization outside the womb or requiring the destruction of fertilized eggs as most forms do any form of artifical insemination that used sperm from someone other than a womans husband and the use of women as surrogates to bear children for infertile couples Life it said can only be created by procreation in marriage Reiterating the documents argument that technical feasibility does not make something morally admissible the Pope said To place new human knowledge at the service of the integral wellbeing of human persons does not inhibit true scientific progress but liberates it The church encourages all genuine advances in knowledge but she also insists on the sacredness of human life at every stage and in every condition Visit to Hospital Wards The Pope underscored his message today with a visit to the childrens wards of St Josephs Hospital where he spoke to and blessed bedridden and wheelchairbound children and kissed the head of a baby who had been born prematurely He stood at the bedside of Johnny Adrian a 15yearold boy with a brain tumor who did not seem to respond to his presence Theres someone here to see you the Popes hospital guide said to the boy urging the Pope to speak into the boys left ear because he had lost hearing in his right Johnnys mother whispered in her sons ear and he opened his eyes The Pope his face visibly pained blessed the boy and moved on The Pope told workers at the hospital that it had been a privilege to see sick children receiving medical care I express the emotion created by the fact of meeting suffering especially suffering of little human beings little children the Pope said Phoenix was selected as the city in which the Pope would speak of health care because its sunshine and warmth draw the elderly and people suffering from emphysema and arthritis Appeal to Help Indians At the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix the Pope heard an appeal from Alfretta M Antone vice president of the Salt River PimaMaricopa Indian Community to help Indians win enforcement of their treaties with the United States gain adequate compensation for lands illegally taken from their ancestors and overcome problems of alcoholism and drug dependency At one point Mrs Antone complained of the plundering of our motherland by early European settlers who invaded Indian lands The Pope said that the oppression of the past must be acknowledged but so must contributions of many of the missionaries who settled the Southwest He offered praise for Father Junipero Serra an 18th century missionary in California even though some Indian groups contend that Father Serra bore some responsibility for the mistreatment of Indians by Spanish colonists In 1984 Father Serra was declared venerable the first step toward sainthood After John Paul praised Father Serra the authors of the book The Missions of California A Legacy of Genocide sought out reporters to criticize his comments in harsh terms The authors Rupert Costo and Jeannette Henry Costo who are Eastern Cherokee Indians and Catholics said missions under Father Serra performed atrocities on early Indians including forced conversions forced labor humiliating punishments and attacks on Indian languages and cultures I think its disgusting Mrs Costo said of the Popes comments He does not know whereof he speaks
Poll Finds Most Undecided on Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/15/us/poll-finds-most-undecided-on-bork.html,As the Senate takes up the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H Bork today the vast majority of Americans still have no opinion on the jurist but are much more willing to trust the Senates judgment on the issue than they are the Presidents according to a New York TimesCBS News Poll Despite weeks of sharp debate among pundits and politicians as well as organizing efforts pro and con the Sept 910 telephone survey of 839 adults found virtually no change in public sentiment toward Judge Bork since late July and no signs of a consensus yet developing Fourteen percent said they supported Judge Borks confirmation 13 percent opposed it and 66 percent could not say The poll revealed a public consensus however on one of the early issues raised by the Bork nomination whether senators should consider how Judge Bork might vote on the Court or confine their review to his qualifications and background Fiftytwo percent said the Senate should play the broader role compared with 39 percent who supported the narrower view The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points Greater Trust for Senate The Senate embarks on the Bork hearings with a significant amount of public trust the survey found Seventy percent said they trusted the Senate more than the President to make the right decisions on Supreme Court nominees compared with 23 percent who trusted the President more Even among the half of all Americans who approved of Mr Reagans performance as President 56 percent said they had greater trust in the Senate when it came to Supreme Court nominees and only 38 percent said they trusted the President more In all the poll indicates that public sentiment is largely uninformed and very persuadable as the Senate begins what is expected to be a protracted struggle over Judge Borks nomination People seem willing to grant senators a broad amount of discretion in reviewing his nomination and they expect no small amount of politics to come into play One measure of how little impact the summers discussion has had on the public is that 11 percent of the public said they had a favorable opinion of Judge Bork and 12 percent said their view was unfavorable Exactly the same percentages were recorded in a July 2122 TimesCBS News Poll Both Sides Optimistic Both sides saw opportunity in the poll results Given that the President of the United States has announced this as his top political priority for the last 17 months of his Administration its quite shocking to me that theres not more support for his nominee said Thomas E Donilon an adviser to Senator Joseph R Biden Jr who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee will lead the Bork opposition The public appears to be quite skeptical Senator Orrin G Hatch a leader of the proBork forces on the committee predicted that the televised confirmation hearings and Judge Borks performance in them would quickly give form to formless public opinion I think hell do very well and I think those who have been vilifying him are going to have to eat a lot of words the Utah Republican said In contrast to what some of Judge Borks supporters contend most Americans saw the process of nominating a Supreme Court Justice as deeply political with majorities expecting both the President and the Senate to take into account how that nominee might vote on major issues the Supreme Court decides Politics and Nomination But the public was still concerned about politics in the Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process In particular while 30 percent said that Presidential candidates should voice their opinions on Judge Bork 53 percent felt that that would bring in politics where it doesnt belong This comes after a summer in which Mr Biden and most of his rivals for the Democratic nomination campaigned heavily on their opposition to Mr Bork Contrary to what most Americans were taught in civics classes a strong majority  60 percent  said the Supreme Court should take public opinion into account when it decides important constitutional issues compared to 32 percent who said the Court should consider only the legal issues In general the survey found Americans deeply divided on some of the issues likely to figure prominently in the Bork debate For example people were split on legalized abortion when asked The US Supreme Court has ruled that states must allow a woman to have an abortion during the first three months of her pregnancy Do you favor or oppose this ruling Fortysix percent said they favored it 48 percent said they opposed it while 6 percent were unable to answer Judge Bork has been a vocal critic of that decision in the 1973 case of Roe vs Wade and many supporters and foes of the nomination say he could cast a crucial vote to overturn that decision if he is elevated to the high court Twentyseven percent of the public said they thought he opposed that decision eight percent said he favored it People also disagreed over whether the Supreme Court has gone too far in protecting the rights of people accused of crimes 43 percent thought it had while 47 percent said it had only done what was necessary to see that the accused are treated fairly Some of his supporters have called for Judge Borks confirmation because they think he would be tougher on criminals In contrast there was a strong majority in support of a constitutional amendment that would permit organized prayer to be said in the public schools Seventyone percent favored such an amendment while 23 percent opposed it Finally when asked whether blacks should be given preference in hiring or promotion where there had been job discrimination against them in the past 57 percent said no compared to 37 percent who supported it How the Poll Was Made The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept 9 and 10 with 839 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example for both men and women the sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll Nominating a Justice The Publics View Liberal Moderate Conservative TOTAL Senate should vote to confirm 4 12 27 14 Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court Should not confirm 23 12 8 13 Cannot say 69 70 62 66 Senate should

WASHINGTON TALK: JUDICIARY COMMITTEE; THE ALIGNMENTS IN THE BORK BATTLE: HOW EACH MEMBER IS LIKELY TO VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/15/us/washington-talk-judiciary-committee-alignments-bork-battle-each-member-likely.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee has been the scene of many battles over nominees and legislation in the Reagan years But nothing has matched the contest over the nomination of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court The nationally broadcast confirmation hearings begin Tuesday with Judge Borks appearance They are likely to last two or three weeks placing the 14member panel under an intense spotlight The pledge by the chairman Senator Joseph R Biden a Delaware Democrat to send the nomination to the Senate floor by early next month means there will not be an effort to kill it in committee Rather the fight will be over how it goes to the floor with a favorable or unfavorable recommendation or no recommendation at all Five of the panels eight Democrats are thought likely to oppose Judge Bork five of the six Republicans are virtually certain to support him Following are portraits of the members in their probable alignments at least as they appear on the eve of the hearings IN FAVOR Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina Committees ranking Republican and its chairman for the six years until the Democrats recaptured the Senate last November  Now 84 this former Democrat has held public office for 55 years   Elected to the Senate as a writein candidate in 1954 and switched to the Republican Party as a supporter of Barry Goldwater for President 10 years later  Once a fierce opponent of civil rights legislation and a master of the Senate filibuster he has mellowed in recent years into a kind of courtly but still very conservative statesman of the Old South  Will be unwavering in his support of Judge Bork but is likely to leave much of the detailed giveandtake to other Republicans on the committee  Lawyer Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah Was himself frequently mentioned as a likely Reagan Administration choice for the Court  Some believe he may yet get the job if Judge Bork is defeated a question he turned aside the other day with a chuckle and an assurance that he will do all he can to assure Judge Borks confirmation  Won rave reviews in Republican circles for his spirited defense of Justice William H Rehnquist in confirmation hearings a year ago on Justice Rehnquists elevation to Chief Justice  Also a vigorous defender of the Reagan Administration as a member of the Senate committee investigating the Irancontra affair  A former trial lawyer fast on his feet wellprepared  53 years old he is up for reelection to a third Senate term next year Alan K Simpson Republican of Wyoming As minority whip he is No 2 in the Senates Republican leadership  With a sharp sense of a humor and a wit that can be withering he is nonetheless one of the most popular members of Congress among his colleagues  Will be vying with Senator Hatch for the role of Judge Borks chief defender  A 56yearold lawyer now in his second term  Was the chief Senate sponsor of the new immigration law  His father was both a Senator from Wyoming and the states Governor  At 6 feet 7 inches he is the tallest Senator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa Elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 he was originally typecast as a narrow rightwinger but became an unexpected star of the freshman class by being short on rhetoric and long on policy details  Last November became the first Senator to win reelection in Iowa in 20 years  A former farmer with a modest manner and shrewd political judgment  Led a legislative attack on Pentagon waste  Not likely to play a leading role in the hearings  54th birthday is Thursday Gordon J Humphrey Republican of New Hampshire The only newcomer this year to the Judiciary Committee  A former commercial airline pilot he has built his political career on opposition to abortion  Was a vocal critic of Congressional pay increase this year annoying a number of colleagues by refusing to let the issue rest  Issued several statements over the summer criticizing Senator Biden for not putting the Bork confirmation hearings on a faster timetable  47 years old in his second term OPPOSED Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware Judiciary Committee chairman  Contender for Democratic Presidential nomination  Aside from the nominee himself probably has the most to gain and the most to lose from the hearings  Must strive to look Presidential scrupulously fair while making the case against confirmation  When he agreed this year to become Judiciary chairman he knew that a disputed Supreme Court nomination could be a serious diversion from his campaign plans  The one thing that could be the most troublesome has happened he said after the Bork nomination  Has spent weeks immersed in Judge Borks record  A lawyer elected to the Senate at age 29  Now 44 and in his third term Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts Perhaps Judge Borks most vocal critic in the entire Senate  Within moments of the nomination he issued a statement depicting life in a frightening place he called Robert Borks America  Some political analysts think the strength of that attack forced Senator Biden in order to demonstrate his own liberal credentials to come out against the nomination earlier than political wisdom might otherwise have dictated  When the Democrats took the Senate last fall Senator Kennedy was entitled to become Judiciary Committee chairman but chose instead to run the Labor and Human Resources Committee  Elected to the Senate in 1962 up for reelection next year  Took himself out of the 1988 Presidential race but is still a powerful figure in Democratic politics  55 years old  Lawyer Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois Running for the Democratic Presidential nomination as an unabashed New Deal liberal  Has said he will probably vote against Judge Bork but has not made a final decision  Voted against Justice Rehnquist last year saying he had concluded that the nominee could not serve as a symbol of justice for all Americans  His thoughtful nonconfrontational approach in the Rehnquist hearings won high marks for the freshman Senator  A former newspaper publisher he spent 10 years in the House before defeating a powerful incumbent Republican Senator Charles H Percy  58 years old Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio  A staunch liberal he helped lead the battle last year against Justice Rehnquist  As head of the Senates labor subcommittee this year he has spearheaded a legislative rebirth for organized labor with such measures as a requirement that workers be notified of future plant closings or layoffs adopted as an amendment to the Senates trade bill  A 70yearold lawyer he faces a difficult reelection campaign for a third term next year  He received an inadvertent boost when staff members of the Senates Republican campaign committee circulated a strategy paper on how to portray him as a Communist sympathizer a blunder that brought mortified apologies from Republican senators Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont Has not declared against the Bork nomination but has voted against all the Reagan Administrations disputed judicial nominees and Judge Borks opponents are counting on him  47 years old easily reelected last fall to a third term  Former vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee now head of the Agriculture Committee  A former local prosecutor he is likely to be very well prepared and one of the best questioners at the hearings ON THE FENCE Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania With the retirement last year of Senator

"THE BORK HEARINGS; BORK TELLS PANEL HE IS NOT LIBERAL, NOT CONSERVATIVE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/16/us/the-bork-hearings-bork-tells-panel-he-is-not-liberal-not-conservative.html,Judge Robert H Bork stressing his great respect for precedent today sought to reassure members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who fear he would press for major change in settled law or pursue a conservative agenda if confirmed to the Supreme Court My philosophy is neither liberal nor conservative the judge said as the momentous Senate hearing on his confirmation opened The nationally televised proceeding was jammed with reporters lobbyists and others It brought the three branches of government together in a rare fusion of political power with high constitutional principle as senators fenced on how much deference was due President Reagans choice of an intellectually powerful conservative nominee who could tip the ideological balance on the Court and thereby shape the law for decades to come Basic Strategies Emerge With the hearings scheduled to run for two weeks the basic strategies of the two sides in the fierce confirmation battle emerged clearly today with opponents taking the offensive in an effort to turn the public against Judge Bork by exposing what they regard as his record of unrelenting opposition to individual rights [ Excerpts from hearing pages A2728 ] Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the committee chairman and other opponents began what will be a detailed review of the many controversial statements Judge Bork has made over the years These started with an article in 1963 which Judge Bork recanted 10 years later denouncing as an infringement on the rights of white business owners proposals to outlaw discrimination against blacks by whiteowned businesses Judge Borks supporters stressed his distinguished record in public office as Solicitor General and a judge They said that focusing on controversial snippets from his carefully reasoned scholarly writings dating back many years was unfair and that in some cases it suggested unfairly that he was a political advocate of positions he felt were compelled by law And Judge Bork himself stressed that he would not necessarily embrace as a Justice all the legal positions he found appealing as an academic Explanation on Abortions In explaining why he did not know whether he would vote to overrule the Supreme Courts abortion decisions for example Judge Bork said that since taking the bench in 1982 he had found that you think you know something about a subject until you get the briefs and hear the argument and decide its much more complex than you thought it was The partisan split on the committee was clear in opening remarks from several members Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah a leading supporter of Judge Bork greeted him as one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to serve on the Supreme Court Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts the most vocal opponent said Judge Bork has harshly opposed  and is publicly itching to overrule  many of the great decisions of the Supreme Court that seek to fulfill the promise of justice for all Americans But much of the attention was focused on the four undecided members of the panel Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania a Republican and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona Robert C Byrd of West Virginia and Howell Heflin of Alabama all Democrats A Problem for Nominee Their positions combined with the adversarial questioning by other Democrats created a problem for Judge Bork If he stands by all his previous positions he risks rejection as being inflexible and as having a preconceived agenda but some opponents have already begun accusing him of slipperiness and lack of candor for backing away from things he has said Those four undecided members said their votes could depend on his ability to allay their concerns about some of his past writings and decisions in particular his wideranging and often acerbic denunciations of dozens of decisions expanding individual rights over more than 40 years The hearing brought together one former President  Gerald R Ford who introduced Judge Bork and praised him as perhaps the most qualified noninee to the Supreme Court in more than half a century  and three wouldbe Presidents Senators Biden of Delaware and Paul Simon of Illinois who are seeking the Democratic nomination and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the minority leader who seeks the Republican nomination Senator Dole also helped introduce Judge Bork Judge Bork repeatedly qualified some past statements assailing Supreme Court decisions while standing by others He declined to enumerate decisions that should be overruled but stressed that he would be far more reluctant to overrule settled precedent as a Justice than he had been to criticize them as a Yale law professor and speechmaker In a classroom nobody gets hurt Judge Bork said In a courtroom someone always gets hurt which calls for a great deal more caution and circumspection He also emphasized a need for stability and continuity in the law Philosophy on Privacy Judge Bork testified that he still believed that the Supreme Court was wrong to recognize a general right to family and sexual privacy in a 1965 decision that struck down a Connecticut law which he himself has called nutty banning use of contraceptives even by married couples But in contrast to his broad unqualified attacks on that decision Griswold v Connecticut in published statements in 1971 1982 and again in 1985 Judge Bork said today that his basic complaint was with the Courts creation of a new constitutional right to privacy and that perhaps the result could be justified in some other way that was not apparent to him He steadfastly defended his denunciations of the Courts use of a one man one vote test for state legislative apportionment and said the Courts 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion contains almost no reasoning But he stressed that if asked as a Supreme Court Justice to overrule the abortion decision or other decisions he has criticized he would carefully consider any new arguments that might be raised in defense of those decisions and the need not to upset longsettled precedents simply because they may have been wrong in the first place Policy Preferences Judge Bork making it clear that his legal positions often go against his policy preferences said his philosophy holds that judges rather than invent constitutional rights should ordinarily defer to policies set by elected officials and to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution If a judge abandons intention as his guide there is no law available to him and he begins to legislate a social agenda for the American people he said in an opening statement That goes well beyond his legitimate authority He or she diminishes liberty instead of enhancing it At the same time Judge Bork said the courts must vigorously enforce those constitutional rights that are explicitly enumerated in the Constitution such as the freedom of speech and of the press Much of the 60yearold nominees testimony consisted of his response to detailed crossexamination by Senator Biden and other committee Democrats that was intended to explore for a national television audience Judge Borks record of wideranging often acerbic attacks on dozens of decisions by what he has called the modern activist liberal Supreme Court He has made these attacks both as a Yale law professor from 1962 until 1981 except for service as Solicitor General from 1973 to 1977 and as a Federal appellate judge since 1982 Eminence as Scholar Stressed On the other hand Republican supporters of the nomination like Senator Hatch of Utah and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina stressed Judge Borks acknowledged eminence as a legal thinker and scholar distinguished record of public service and five years as a judge who has written more than 100 majority opinions without ever being reversed by the Supreme Court Senator Heflin a conservative Southern Democrat and respected former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court told Judge Bork he would fare well if the Senate is convinced that you will balance societys need for law and order with individual rights and personal freedoms Senator Heflin and other undecided senators placed special stress on concern about whether Judge Bork would seek to overrule the many precedents he has assailed And while Judge Bork sought to reassure them he avoided giving categorical answers saying that he would want to consider the arguments in specific cases carefully and that I cannot of course commit myself as to how I might vote in any particular case
WASHINGTON TALK; PROFILE: NABERS CABANISS; 'The Last Job a Normal Person Would Want',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/16/us/washington-talk-profile-nabers-cabaniss-the-last-job-a-normal-person-would-want.html,When Nabers Cabaniss was an undergraduate at Princeton University in the late 1970s most students were political liberals But already the conservative flame was beginning to flicker within her She was a strong believer in minimal government because she felt that governments sole role was the protection of individual life and liberty She majored in biology out of a reverence for life she says and she originally intended to become a physician But instead after working as a Senate aide for five years and after studying Christian theology for a year at Regent College in Vancouver British Columbia Miss Cabaniss became head of the Governments family planning program in Washington this summer As such she is on the front lines of a fierce battle over abortion as President Reagan tries to cut off Federal funds for family planning clinics that counsel poor women about abortion Miss Cabaniss 30 years old is also in charge of the Governments adolescent family life program which was established in 1981 with the goals of reducing the number of teenage pregnancies and discouraging adolescent sexual activity Together the two programs have a budget of 1565 million and employ 35 people at the Federal level I have strong prolife convictions Miss Cabaniss said in an interview in her modest but airy Government office That is the motivating factor in the work I do I cant imagine I would want to be in this spot if I didnt have those convictions Its the last job a normal sane person would want to inflict on himself or herself Everything we deal with here is a prescription for controversy she added Miss Cabaniss pronounced CABuhniss is an example of the ardent young conservatives who have found a home in the Reagan Administration Like New Deal alumni who populated later Democratic administrations the young conservatives see themselves as having gained the professional experience and political credentials to run the Government and to perpetuate the Reagan brand of conservatism for years to come Miss Cabanisss college roommate Liza Schlafly Forshaw now a lawyer recalled that the late 70s were still fairly radical times on American campuses but that Miss Cabaniss was always a person of conservative and traditional attitudes No Drugs Sex Alienation Mrs Forshaw the daughter of Phyllis Schlafly the conservative crusader who first became widely known for her opposition to the proposed equal rights amendment said in an interview Nabers never touched drugs She never engaged in premarital sex She seldom drank and when she did it was very abstemiously She never experienced the kind of alienation from her parents that so many college students do Miss Cabaniss was recommended for her current job by leaders of the antiabortion movement including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative Henry J Hyde of Illinois both Republicans Her title at the Department of Health and Human Services is deputy assistant secretary for population affairs The sensitivity of the job is obvious from the fact that her two predecessors left in a swirl of controversy One Jo Ann Gasper was dismissed in July by Dr Otis R Bowen the Secretary of Health and Human Services after she disobeyed his instructions to renew two grants for the training of nurses at clinics run by Planned Parenthood groups Another predecessor Marjory E Mecklenburg resigned in February 1985 amid allegations by a Congressional aide that she had misused official travel funds Investigators found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing A Southern Accent Miss Cabaniss was born in Birmingham Ala and she still has more than a trace of a Southern accent She grew up in northern Virginia Her father an Army colonel retired when she was 12 years old She says she remembers her family as being politically aware and conservatively oriented A significant change in her views occurred in 1980 or 1981 In my earlier days I opposed abortion but I thought the wrongness in abortion was the infliction of pain upon innocent life she recalled But if pain is the issue you could justify euthanasia or even infanticide as long as you anesthetize the child I could not go along with the logical consequences of my own beliefs when I framed the argument that way she said As soon as society starts deciding what life is meaningful and judging by arbitrary standards such as pain we put ourselves into a morally reprehensible position So I rejected the pain argument the idea that you could justify the destruction of human life as long as no pain is involved From 1982 to 1984 Miss Cabaniss worked on family issues for Senator Jeremiah Denton a conservative Alabama Republican who designed the adolescent family life program In 1985 she took a job at the Department of Health and Human Services as director of the program which remains one of her responsibilities The program derided by critics as an effort to promote chastity is having some success according to Miss Cabaniss who insists that abstinence is the only 100 percent effective method of family planning More than one million adolescents become pregnant each year she said and about half of all American teenagers have had sexual intercourse But she said Government surveys suggest that the proportion of adolescent girls who are sexually active is going down in the black community and has leveled off in the white community Thus she asserted even before people became alarmed about the AIDS epidemic teenagers were becoming more conservative in their sexual behavior The philosophy of the family life program is remarkably similar to the message of Nancy Reagans campaign against drug abuse Just say no A Government booklet urges teenagers not to give in to their sexual feelings Saying no can be the best way to say I love you  the brochure advises In April Judge Charles R Richey of the Federal District Court here ruled that a key part of the program was unconstitutional because it violated the requirement for separation of church and state Under the program he said Federal money has been used to finance sex education projects directed by members of religious orders as part of religious curriculums in classrooms adorned with religious symbols He issued an order forbidding the Government to distribute any more funds to religious organizations But last month Chief Justice William H Rehnquist suspended the order pending an appeal by the Reagan Administration The Grants Continue As a result Miss Cabaniss said we continue to give grants to religious organizations as well as to other private and public groups Janet Benshoof a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who filed the lawsuit challenging the program said that in disbursing funds to religious organizations Miss Cabaniss had carried out Senator Dentons intention to a tee Its an ideological program and shes an ideological person Ms Benshoof said Said Miss Cabaniss I wont dispute the notion of being ideological if that means having strong convictions
'Rebelliousness' and America's Catholics,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/opinion/rebelliousness-and-america-s-catholics.html,Our realization of the mystery of the church Joseph Cardinal Bernardin told Pope John Paul II yesterday    is situated in the context of our American culture We live in an open society where everyone prizes the freedom to speak his or her mind    As a result the impression is sometimes given that there is a certain rebelliousness in many American Catholics    That rebelliousness is most frequently reflected in a somewhat selective response to the churchs moral teaching The majority of American Catholics for instance favor artificial birth control and permitting divorce and remarriage Only 19 percent believe abortion should not be permitted under any circumstance Most also believe that having a homosexual relationship a heterosexual relationship without marriage or an abortion does not preclude someone from being a good Catholic Furthermore most Catholics like most priests think the clergy should be allowed to marry More than half favor the ordination of women The Pope however remains a doctrinal conservative Dissent from church doctrine he told Cardinal Bernardin and the more than 300 bishops gathered in Los Angeles remains what it is dissent The Pope reiterated the churchs condemnation of artificial contraception Those couples who choose the natural [ rhythm ] methods perceive the profound difference between anthropological and moral And abortion Disregard for the sacred character of life in the womb weakens the very fabric of civilization Homosexuals John Paul continued are entitled to pastoral care but that would include an explanation of the churchs teaching  ie that homosexual acts are sinful He continues to support priestly celibacy and declared unequivocally that Women are not called to the priesthood But if the Popes dicta are predictable the fact that the issues are being raised so vigorously is proof that the fresh air Pope John XXIII hoped for is still blowing through the Roman Catholic Church That it has taken on new force here isnt surprising To Americans as Cardinal Bernardin put it the freedom to ask and criticize is seen as an integral part of the call to live their lives as responsible educated adults
THE BORK HEARINGS; Excerpts From the Bork Hearing: Pinning Down His Positions,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/us/the-bork-hearings-excerpts-from-the-bork-hearing-pinning-down-his-positions.html,On the second day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the confirmation of Judge Robert H Bork as a member of the Supreme Court the judge was questioned extensively on a variety of subjects Following are excerpts as recorded by The New York Times SENATOR ALAN K SIMPSON    I was just was thinking What if the fondest dreams of your opponents comes true and that you are not confirmed by the Senate What then can they expect Well I think obviously we will have an appointment by this President There isnt anybody thats going to question that And then we will probably have a nominee who we will probably confirm almost routinely such as a member of the Judiciary Committee My fine friend Orrin Hatch or Paul Laxalt Hell of a choice BORK They both sound good to me Q Yeah Not bad to any of us I dont think many of us on the panel would spend too great a bit of time putting them right there But if that were not the case  and that would be splendid  it might be Jerome B Sturdley A person who has quite extensive experience on the bench and on the bar One that has said very little or has written very little that it was either thoughtful challenging or provocative Or perhaps one whom the special interests would have a great deal of difficulty finding out one whit about for use in the opposition to the Presidential appointment And thats you know the reason were here Clarification About Religion SIMPSON    I thought Judge Heflins remarks about religion were superb yesterday    BORK    Is Judge Heflin Senator Heflin going to question me about that Q I dont think so    A Well let me say one thing I dont want to go into my religious beliefs but the report in a national magazine that I was an agnostic arose from the following conversation and the reporter agrees that it rose from the following conversation He said Youre not terribly religious are you And I said Not in the sense you mean Thats it He went bang Hes an agnostic And I later denied that I was an agnostic in The New York Times when I got a chance to I took him to be talking about regular you know great piety and regular church attendance and thats what I meant    But agnostic does not come out of that conversation in any way and I am not an agnostic    Q And so that word was never used A No Issue of Protection Of Privacy Under Law Q So do I gather from what you have said in answers and responses yesterday that you believe that privacy is indeed protected by the Constitution in the Fourth Amendment in the free exercise of religion clause and the like A Oh yes there are several crucial protections of privacy in the Bill of Rights The framers were very concerned about privacy because they had been subjected to a very intrusive British Government and they were very concerned that privacy be protected against the new national government    High Court Rulings About Sterilization Q And then just finally on the issue of Skinner v Oklahoma    on the sterilization of criminals the equal protection clause doesnt it protect  guarantees protection from invidious discrimination    A Senator it does But I think  I think the most that I said in criticism in this article about Skinner v Oklahoma was that the classification distinction made by the Court could not be squared with the other    classification distinctions the Court had made If I can find the article as I usually cant when its crucial But I really wouldnt buy the way the Supreme Court there went about it but I think it is clear  people who have looked at it more than I have say its clear  that that statute had racial animus in it And it struck at in effect crimes that at that time were more likely to be committed by poor blacks than by middleclass whitecollar whites And on that ground the statute would be unconstitutional Q Without question A Without quesion Q And you  A But I should say this You know the Supreme Court has never said that sterilization under some circumstances is unconstitutional Im not saying that thats a good thing theyve never said it I just want to point out that they have never said that In fact they have upheld sterilization programs Justice Holmes did in a famous opinion Q What was that opinion A That was Buck v Bell and I think it was a terrible opinion That was a case in which they  Q Who wrote the majority opinion A Holmes Q OK A Oliver Wendell Holmes They provided for sterilization of folks who were mentally retarded I think after one or two generations And Holmes dismissed the equal protection argument as the usual last resort of constitutional argument and wrote the infamous line  I like Holmes but this was not one of his better days  three generations of imbeciles are enough Q Justice Holmes said that A Justice Holmes said that Q Uhhuh Well we ought to get him back here A Yes I think considering the alternative he might be glad to come back and do this Discrimination By Gender and Race SENATOR DENNIS DECONCINI    In a recent interview you were quoted saying that the role that men and women should play in society is a highly complex business and it changes as our culture changes What Im saying 10 years ago was that it was a shift in constitutional methods of government to have judges deciding all of those enormously sensitive highly political highly cultural issues That was June 1 1966 The Judicial Notice Now what troubles me Judge is why are the questions concerning sex discrimination any more difficult or any more complex and undeserving of constitutional judicial resolution than other questions routinely subject to the Court for constitutional analysis Questions such as the discrimination on the basis of race and that weve discussed here BORK Yes See if you  Q It leaves me with a big void here and I know youve tried to explain it and I paid attention yesterday but I didnt get it A Youre  you are comparing I take it Senator DeConcini my  Q Yes thats 1986 Im sorry A  my remarks about the equal rights amendment with my views of the equal protection clause Is that what youre saying Q Yes    A    My objection to the equal rights amendment was that legislatures would have nothing to say about these complex cultural matters and had no chance to    express a judgment People would go straight  you know straight to court and challenge any distinction and the Court would have to write the complete body of whats allowable discrimination or whatever it is A reasonable basis test allows a little more play in the joints I think for the Court to listen to the legislatures and look at the society and bring evidence in and so forth If you want to say that the equal rights amendment really would enact the same thing as the reasonable basis test then my objection to the equal rights amendment drops out Q What troubles me is that  A But nobody said that Senator Q    As I understand what youre saying to me is that this reasonable test is something that the Court has made up that youre willing to use and I dont see any distinction in that amendment It seems to me far greater to say yes it applies to women just as it applies to  to the races A I said that But it cant apply just as it does to the races It is possible to say    for example that there shall be no segregated toilet facilities anywhere as to race I dont think anybody wants to say that as to gender There are just differences that have to be accommodated Thats why the difference Q Yes but well  but isnt that a bogus argument Were not talking about unisex toilets here were  were talking about fundamental rights that women for too too long have not been provided Were talking about your interpretation of whether or not on the Supreme Court youre going to look towards that equality for women whether we have the equal rights amendment or not And if you have a reasonable standard that comes into play for women because Im referring just to women or for sex but lets just say to women but you dont apply that reasonable standard to racial matters A Oh I do Senator I do Its exactly the same standard Q You do have a standard A Exactly the same standards a reasonable basis test and there is no reasonable basis to segregate the races by toilet facilities There is a reasonable basis to segregate the genders by those facilities And when I said to you that you cant treat gender exactly the same as you do race all I meant was some distinctions are reasonable as to gender such as the one we mentioned    The same one would not be reasonable as to race Q All right but isnt that carrying it to an extreme Judge Bork A No Senator All I am saying to you is that the various things we would prohibit in the law as to race  not all of those would be prohibited as to gender Now for example you could not have a national law that said only blacks or only whites will go into combat It may be and I dont want to arouse a philosophical argument here but it certainly seems likely to me that you could have a national law in fact the Supreme Court has said as much saying that only males will go into combat And that was a case about whether you could have an allmale draft And the Supreme Court said you could So thats an illustration of the fact that gender in some cases is treated differently than race Q You leave this Senator unsatisfied as to how we    can conclude that youre going to protect the citizens of this country in interpreting the Constitution on the Court as it relates to sex    Im trying to satisfy myself that you are not excluding large segments of our population as you clearly do not exclude large segments of our population on the racial issue But it seems to me that theres a question as to how you treat the sexual segregation and thats a trouble to me    A    The fact is and I was looking for the materials and I cant find them but Ill get them the fact is that as Solicitor General I argued positions for the protection of women broader than those that the Supreme Court would accept The other fact is that in the gender cases that I have decided as a Court of Appeals judge I have decided more of them in favor of the female claim than I have the other way I think substantially more There is no reason whatsoever in my record to think that I have any problem protecting women or any other group Q Well as Solicitor General of course your clients the Government A Well sometimes we filed amicus briefs in cases we didnt have to file in Q Well how many of those what percentage of that  A Well I dont know if I have the figures Q Well isnt the main purpose of Solicitor General to represent the Government Isnt that the primary purpose of that office A He represents the Government and he also represents governmental policies if he thinks they are intellectually sound and respectable Q Because I see a difference as to your position as Solicitor General enforcing some laws and what your interpretation is going to be as a judge A Well let me say this Senator    When the Government is sued and the Government is my client youre right If theres any way to defend the Government I will try to defend them But when I file an amicus brief    I have not the same obligation to find any way to do it But beyond that on my Court of Appeals record  and these are not cases whose results are compelled by a Supreme Court precedent  I have voted more often than not for the female party in the case There is no if I may say so with all respect there is no ground in my record anywhere to suspect that I would not protect women as fully as men Legislative Action And the Constitution SENATOR CHARLES E GRASSLEY    Let me ask you this Dont legislatures do dumb things sometimes that only the courts can protect society  only the courts are in a position to protect society  BORK Im bound to say Senator yes they do dumb things sometimes and often those dumb things are unconstitutional Q But its not a reason for  A Its not a reason for making up a new Constitution No there is no clause in the Constitution that says the legislature shall make no dumb law Metamorphosis Of Views About the Law SENATOR PATRICK J LEAHY Is it safe to say then that theres been this metamorphosis of your views from 71 BORK Oh yes My views my views of the law have been changed I  maybe I should  a gentleman named Scott called me this morning from a suburb of Chicago and said  and wanted to give me this And I think since Ive been trying this and I cant say it as well as this quotation Id like to read it to you Its what Benjamin Franklin said when he voted in the convention for the Constitution 200 years ago tomorrow He said Mr President I confess there are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve but I am not sure that I shall never approve them For having lived long I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects which I once thought right but found to be otherwise It is therefore that the older I grow the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect to the judgment of others Ive been trying to say that for two days now Senator but this gentleman from Chicago called me and gave me that quotation and I think that says it Obscenity and Pornography And the First Amendment SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER    In this 1984 ABA Journal article you say that you continue to think that obscenity and pornography do not fit the rationale for protection referring to the First Amendment rationale BORK Uhhuh Q Have you changed your view on that A No I have not Senator Q Well would you disagree with Justice Rehnquists opinion  he was Justice then not Chief Justice  in Jenkins v Georgia where he said the First Amendment prohibited Georgia from convicting someone for showing the movie Carnal Knowledge A Well I dont know the movie Carnal Knowledge and for all I know it may not be pornography    Unfortunately for the Court because some of them get quite upset about it when a community bans a particular item  movie book or magazine  as being obscene or pornographic the Court is almost necessarily faced with the task of examining it to see whether it falls within the allowable definition of those words And for all I know the Court examined Carnal Knowledge and decided it was not pornographic Q    All of your writings say and you affirm it here this afternoon that the First Amendment does not reach pornography or obscenity to stop majority rule in a state court determination A Uhhuh Q And Im saying to you that that pretty clearly places you at variance at least on that issue with Justice Rehnquist Or Im asking you if it does A    I think it does not at all    merely because a particular state defines something as pornographic does not mean that the Supreme Court has to accept that definition In order to protect the First Amendment the Supreme Court has to apply a definition of pornography of its own Otherwise the states could define literary works or even political speech as pornographic Q Well but youre then saying that it is appropriate for the Supreme Court to strike down a conviction on First Amendment grounds where it is pornographic A No no Senator I am not making myself clear I will try to be clear in what I say The determination of what is pornographic for First Amendment purposes has to be made by the Supreme Court or by the lower Federal courts Otherwise if you let a states definition of what is pornographic govern things that are not pornographic in a Constitution sense might be banned So the Supreme Court when it looks at Carnal Knowledge must be saying that this thing is not pornographic It does not have those characteristics that would entitle a state to ban it I havent read the case  Im almost certain what they must be doing Q    then you are saying that the majority  Madisonian majoritarianism  which you write about so extensively does not apply in that situation  that we are not allowing the legislature to make a definition  a definition which a conviction is entered on but that the Supreme Court has the authority legitimacy  your term  to come in and upset that conviction A Oh thats entirely Senator with respect thats entirely consistent with my position on what I have called the Madisonian dilemma and that is that the Supreme Court must by applying the Constitution define what things the majority may rule and what things the majority may not rule where the individual or the minority must be left freedom Now free speech is one of the most  is perhaps the most central freedom in the Constitution That means that the Supreme Court  ultimately the Supreme Court  Federal judiciary  must when it says pornography is not protected it must make sure that what the state calls pornography is pornography and thats why theyre entitled to examine a state determination that Carnal Knowledge is pornography and to reverse it BIDEN    as much time as youd like Judge BORK Senator Spector I just asked for a moment to supplement    one answer to you and that is this I want to make it clear absolutely clear if I can that my doubts about the substantive due process approach to Boling and I really think Boling said that the equal protection component exists in the  we can go back to that I dont want to  my doubts about the substantive due process component of Boling against Sharp does not mean that I would ever dream of overruling Boling against Sharp as you suggested And furthermore I should make it clear as Ive said repeatedly that segregation is not only unlawful but immoral And I dont want my doubts about a constitutional mode of reasoning to be turned into anything other than that Not by you Senator I meant just by people who are listening to us Right to Abortion And Right to Privacy SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN Can you derive a right to an abortion which is A of 2 and you got B  which is Can you derive a right to abortion from the Constitution Thats obviously  theres nothing that specifically gives sombody a right of privacy so we just dismiss  I mean that I dont think is in a language there that could be construed as say if you got a specific explicit right to an abortion in the Constitution BORK Thats right Q All right your B part of that is at least which would provide a limitation upon antiabortion statutes legitimately from the Constitution What do you at this time see as a possibility of a limitation A Well it would seem to me Senator that it would be easier to argue a right to an abortion Im not saying it would work but it would be easier to do that than it would be to define this generalized right of privacy And for example I understand groups are working  I havent seen their work product but I am told that groups are working on that For example some groups I think are trying an Equal Protection argument Only women have this specific burden and forcing a woman to carry a baby to term some of the groups are arguing I suppose is a form of gender discrimination I havent seen that argument worked out but I know its being worked on Q Well that would be basically difficult from the language of the Constitution since most parts of the Constitution is a conferring power on the Federal Government with a reservation to the states and to the people for the power that is not specifically granted to the Federal Government A I was referring more to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment as the place in which that argument would be rooted I dont suggest it would succeed I dont suggest it wouldnt Youve asked me if one could begin to talk about where one might root such an argument and I think the right to an abortion might  you might attempt to root it there successfully or not I dont pretend to guess But its easier than a general right of privacy
WASHINGTON TALK: THE PRESS; Importance and Power of the Columnists,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/us/washington-talk-the-press-importance-and-power-of-the-columnists.html,When Rowland Evans and Robert Novak suggested that Elizabeth Hanford Dole the Secretary of Transportation was being distracted from her official duties by making campaign appearances for her husband political devotees speculated that the columnists had hidden motives When George Will called Vice President Bush a lap dog and William Safire labeled Nancy Reagan the power behind the throne officials worried about the implications for the Reagan Administration and conservatism When Carl Rowan interviewed Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court the jurists comments became part of a national debate about the Court as an institution It is a phenomenon as old as the Washington press corps a writer not only breaking news but making it Since Walter Lippmann pioneered the modern American craft of column writing certain journalists have played a role in the shaping of Washington policy carrying messages and serving as gobetweens Experts differ on how important columnists are and they say it is often difficult to pinpoint cause and effect in Washingtons murky world of leaks rumors and circles of influence and intrigue Overstated but Integral Role Martin Plissner executive political director of CBS News says the importance of columns is overstated especially in the shaping of political campaigns It is the analysis or interpretation that gets into a hard news story in a major newspaper that exerts real influence Mr Plissner said But columnists are an integral part of Washington life steadily providing fuel for debates over the relationship between journalists and their sources over the conflict between a journalists desire to remain detached and the pressure to become an insider and over how much influence the press should exert on Government policy making Press people like to think of themselves as independent as above the fray said Marvin Kalb a longtime news correspondent who is now director of the Center on the Press Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University Yet if you widen your lens and examine the process with some dispassion you must almost inevitably come to the conclusion that major press figures are inextricably part of the process of politics and governance Although the distinctions are blurry columnists can be roughly divided between those like Mr Evans and Mr Novak whose work is presented as news albeit often with a twist and those like Mr Will who comment on the news from their own political perspective Some columnists appear strictly in their own newspaper or are syndicated to other publications Others have blossomed into what Mr Kalb and others call a cottage industry Many including Mr Rowan Mr Novak and Mr Will appear regularly on television amplifying their impact Mr Novak and Mr Evans also publish a newsletter and hold seminars in politics for their subscribers Mr Rowan said television exposure was one of the reasons he was able to get two recent interviews that made national news One in which Justice Marshall criticized President Reagans record on human rights and one in which Jane Roe whose case resulted in the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion said she had lied when she testified more than a decade ago that her pregnancy was caused by a rape I cant say the television exposure is indispensable said Mr Rowan a regular on Agronsky  Company a weekly program But whether theyre in the White House trying to sell something or on Capitol Hill trying to push something people see the show There are certain members of Congress who often call on Fridays because they know we tape that day and they try to get a lick in Mr Will appears on the Sunday program This Week with David Brinkley and has worked as a commentator for ABCs World News Tonight in addition to writing his syndicated column and fortnightly page in Newsweek Occasionally he has been the focus of news attention simply by taking an unexpected stand as he did in January when he wrote a column about the Vice President The unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one conservative gathering to another is a thin tinny arf  the sound of a lap dog Later Mr Will suggested that after the Tower Commissions report on the Irancontra scandal President Reagan must prove he is still interested in being President Coming from a man considered to be a voice of conservatism Mr Wills comments prompted a number of newspaper and television articles on the state of the Reagan Revolution George Will says Bush is a lap dog and then other people write that Will thinks hes a lap dog Mr Kalb said When the story appears in The New York Times and The Washington Post and the reporter for the Today show comes in to do the latest news he or she is going to pick up that item he said They may say Sources here say or The view in Washington is that Then that is viewed in the White House and on the Hill and by fundraisers around the country and suddenly its My goodness is that what theyre saying in Washington  David S Broder a political reporter and columnist for The Washington Post said journalists should not serve as policy advocates on television programs We journalists have claimed and continually battle for special privileges in this society he said We claim we have a special function but if that function loses its definition it becomes more difficult to justify our claims Mr Rowan said a columnist should be able to balance celebrity status and journalistic objectivity If youre in a more or less celebrity position youre often financially secure enough and personally secure enough that nobody can buy you Because access to news sources is critical to all reporters the difficulty is getting inside without sacrificing detachment It can be a pretty heady experience to be sought out by political figures and exert influence on events said Hugh Sidey who writes about the Presidency for Time magazine One of the great dangers is taking yourself too seriously Speculation on Motives In some cases the sources of reports in a column can be as interesting as the reports themselves Some journalists perceive Mr Evans and Mr Novak for example as sympathetic to Representative Jack F Kemp a contender for the Republican Presidential nomination Their article about Mrs Dole caused some speculation about the source of their information since the article could be seen as detrimental to Senator Bob Doles quest for the Republican nomination Perhaps contradicting that speculation were later reports of possible pressure from within the campaign for Mrs Dole to resign her Cabinet post Mr Novak said there were no political motives for the report I had wanted to write about her for some time but I didnt have the kind of column I wanted to write until we got this briefing paper last week about Mrs Doles travels he said Mr Novak declined to say where the paper came from but said it did not come from one of the rival campaigns We dont endorse anybody he said
Live! It's the Constitution!,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/opinion/live-it-s-the-constitution.html,Todays the day the culminating moment for parades pageants and solemn readings  in Philadelphia where the Constitution was signed 200 years ago and all over the country it rules Meanwhile probably the finest celebration imaginable proceeds before the Senate Judiciary Committee Theres no pomp or pageantry just the grimly serious business of deciding whether Judge Robert Bork shall be appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States In form and content its the Constitution in action The form lies in the fact of the hearings How are judges chosen By the other two branches the Constitution says Appointments are not just up to the President but need approval from the Senate The content lies in Judge Borks views of the Constitution though 200 years old it remains open constructively so to interpretation Judge Borks views impressed the Reagan Administration Over a long career as a lawyer scholar and judge he has written a mountain of speeches articles and opinions Often these caustically attack the Supreme Courts approach over 60 years to the Constitution Now he must persuade the Judiciary Committee and later the entire Senate that his views are moderate within the modern mainstream So far on several specific issues he seems to be having only mixed success Free Speech Judge Bork wrote in 1971 when he was a 43yearold law professor that the Bill of Rights protects from government action only the political speech that is at the core of the First Amendment not works of art or fiction however valuable to society He now testifies that he abandoned that notion almost immediately when fellow scholars attacked it Yet he embellished his theory in a 1979 lecture and stood by his 1971 views in recent interviews If his thinking has evolved some senators are finding the evolution hard to track Contrary to that 1971 article he says he now agrees with the current Courts doctrine which traces back to Justices Holmes and Brandeis in the 1920s that dissenting raucous speech is protected unless it threatens imminent lawless action Questioned by Senator Patrick Leahy he acknowledges that he has never said so publicly before these hearings Why not Privacy Judge Bork has condemned as unprincipled both the Courts 1973 abortion ruling and its 1965 decision striking down a Connecticut law making it a crime even for married couples to use contraceptives He has complained that the Court used an unconstitutional theory of a general right to privacy Many Americans bridle at that they think they do have broad privacy rights whatever the theory Reapportionment Judge Bork still attacks the Supreme Courts oneperson onevote decisions based on equal population principles He even cites in his defense the fact that the Senate is malapportioned No judge buys that argument Its been a highly successful Bicentennial year in which millions have been reading and thinking about their Constitution In the Bork hearings whatever their outcome Americans are living it
THE PAPAL VISIT; Pope Counsels Bishops to Hold to Christ's Teachings in the Face of Dissent,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/us/papal-visit-pope-counsels-bishops-hold-christ-s-teachings-face-dissent.html,Following are excerpts from an address by Pope John Paul II today to American Bishops The biblical or other citations were not part of the Popes prepared address but were provided in the printed text Cardinal Bernardin has stated very well that just as there is but one faith one Lord one baptism so there can be but one loyalty  to the word of God perennially proclaimed in the Church  entrusted to the Episcopal College with the Roman Pontiff as its visible head and perpetual source of unity The word of God which is the power of God leading all who believe to salvation cf Romans 116 Dei Verbum 17 is fully revealed in the Paschal Mystery of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ  It is sometimes reported that a large number of Catholics today do not adhere to the teaching of the Church on a number of questions notably sexual and conjugal morality divorce and remarriage Some are reported as not accepting the Churchs clear position on abortion It has also been noted that there is a tendency on the part of some Catholics to be selective in their adherence to the Churchs moral teachings It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the Magisterium is totally compatible with being a good Catholic and poses no obstacle to the reception of the sacraments This is a grave error that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the United States and elsewhere I wish to encourage you in the love of Christ to address this situation courageously in your pastoral ministry relying on the power of Gods truth to attract assent and on the grace of the Holy Spirit which is given both to those who proclaim the message and to those to whom it is addressed We must also constantly recall that the teaching of Christs Church  like Christ himself  is a sign of contradiction It has never been easy to accept the Gospel teaching in its entirety and it never will be The Church is committed both in faith and morals to make her teaching as clear and understandable as possible presenting it in all the attractiveness of divine truth And yet the challenge of the Gospel remains inherent in the Christian message transmitted to each generation  Within the ecclesial community theological discussion takes place within the framework of faith Dissent from Church doctrine remains what it is dissent as such it may not be proposed or received on an equal footing with the Churchs authentic teaching Moreover as bishops we must be especially responsive to our role as authentic teachers of the faith when opinions at variance with the Churchs teaching are proposed as a basis for pastoral practice I wish to support you as you continue to engage in fruitful dialogue with theologians regarding the legitimate freedom of inquiry which is their right You rightly give them sincere encouragement in their difficult task and assure them how much the Church needs and deeply appreciates their dedicated and constructive work They on their part will recognize that the title Catholic theologian expresses a vocation and a responsibility at the service of the community of faith and subject to the authority of the pastors of the Church In particular your dialogue will seek to show the inacceptability of dissent and confrontation as a policy and method in the area of Church teaching  Primarily through her laity the Church is in a position to exercise great influence upon American culture This culture is a human creation It is created through shared insight and communication It is built by an exchange among the people of a particular society And culture while having a certain dynamic endurance is always changing and developing as a way of life Thus the American culture of today stands in continuity with your culture of 50 years ago Yet it has changed it has been greatly influenced by attitudes and currents of thought Does the Gospel Influence America But how is the American culture evolving today Is this evolution being influenced by the Gospel Does it clearly reflect Christian inspiration Your music your poetry and art your drama your painting and sculpture the literature that you are producing are all those things which reflect the soul of a nation being influenced by the spirit of Christ for the perfection of humanity I realize these are difficult questions to answer given the complexity and diversity of your culture But they are relevant to any consideration of the role of the Catholic laity the largest number of educated faithful in the world And it is above all the laity once they have themselves been inspired by the Gospel who bring the Gospels uplifting and purifying influence to the world of culture to the whole realm of thought and artistic creativity to the various professions and places of work to family life and to society in general  In speaking of the laity I feel a particular desire to support you in all you are doing on behalf of family life Archbishop Weakland has mentioned the large number of divorces and the breakup of so many families as a special pastoral problem I know that all of us feel great sadness and deep pastoral concern for all those whose lives are affected in this way    I wish to encourage you to continue in your many zealous and generous efforts to provide pastoral care to families I also urge you in the face of all the trends which threaten the stability of marriage the dignity of human love and the dignity of human life as well as its transmission never to lose confidence and courage  On the occasion of the last ad Limina visits I stated Those couples who choose the natural methods perceive the profound difference both anthropological and moral  between contraception and natural family planning Yet they may experience difficulties indeed they often go through a certain conversion in becoming committed to the use of the natural methods and they stand in need of competent instruction encouragement and pastoral counselling and support We must be sensitive to their struggles and have a feeling for the needs that they experience We must encourage them to continue their efforts with generosity confidence and hope As bishops we have the charism and the pastoral responsibility to make our people aware of the unique influence that the grace of the sacrament of marriage has on every aspect of married life including sexuality cf Familiaris Consortio 33 The teaching of Christs Church is not only light and strength for Gods People but it uplifts their hearts in gladness and hope The insufficient number of seminarians and candidates for religious life is indeed a cause of pastoral concern for all of us for we know that their public witness to the Gospel and their specific roles in the Church are irreplaceable    It is especially difficult today for young people to make the generous sacrifices entailed in accepting Gods call Yet it is possible for them to do so through grace and with the support of the community  This is    the aim of all the Churchs efforts on behalf of women to promote their human dignity The Church proclaims the personal dignity of women as women  a dignity equal to that of mens dignity    Women are not called to the priesthood Although the teaching of the Church on this point is quite clear it in no way alters the fact that women are indeed an essential part of the Gospel plan to spread the Good News of the Kingdom And the church is irrevocably committed to this truth Prophets of Doom Must Be Fought Today as always there are prophets of doom We must resist them in their pessimism and continue in our efforts to promote vocations to the priesthood and the religious life Prayer for vocations remains the primary way to success since Jesus himself left us the commandment Beg the harvest master to send out laborers to gather his harvest I ask you therefore to encourage prayer for vocations among all the people     Because of its importance in the life of the Church I spoke to the priests in Miami about confession and our own need to receive the sacrament regularly I also expressed my gratitude for their generous ministry in making confession available to the faithful In this regard I would ask you as bishops to make every effort to ensure that the important norms of the universal Church with regard to the use of general absolution are understood and observed in a spirit of faith    I wish to encourage you also in the pastoral care that you give to homosexual persons This includes a clear explanation of the Churchs teaching which by its nature is unpopular Nevertheless your own pastoral experience confirms the fact that the truth howsoever difficult to accept brings grace and often leads to a deep inner conversion No matter what problem individual Christians have and no matter what degree of response to grace they make they are always worthy of the Churchs love and Christs truth All homosexual and other persons striving to fulfill the Gospel precept of chastity are worthy of special encouragement and esteem  Sex education is a basic right and duty of parents themselves They have to be helped to become increasingly more effective in fulfilling this task Other educational agencies have an important role but always in a subsidiary manner with due subordination to the rights of parents

Abortion-Counsel Rule Circumvents Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/19/opinion/l-abortion-counsel-rule-circumvents-congress-064487.html,To the Editor Norbert A Redegelds position that the Reagan Administrations proposed antiabortion regulations letter Aug 24 about abortion counseling at taxsupported facilities is not a violation of Congressional intent fails because of two erroneous assumptions The first error lies in the attempt to equate promoting abortion with the mere mentioning of abortion as a legal option While it was not the intent of Congress to use grants for family planning to fund the procedure itself Congress most certainly did not intend to preclude patients from being told where such medical services are available Secondly Mr Redegeld like all members of the antiabortion minority suffers from a delusion that he alone pays taxes Millions of proabortion citizens work and pay taxes also and they do not support the attempt of prolife activists who frustrated by their lack of legislative and popular success are seeking to circumvent a Federal laws intended purpose Finally should Mr Redegeld doubt that the overwhelming majority of the American people favor liberal abortion policies he may look to the results of the most recent referendums on the issue where majorities of 2 to 1 voted in favor of legalized abortion in states including Rhode Island Massachusetts and New Hampshire Oregon voters approved Medicaidfunded abortions and in Washington state prolife failed to get the requisite number of signatures on the petition in order to put the question on the ballot STACY R SELDIN Flushing Queens Sept 1 1987

IDEAS & TRENDS; How Some American Catholics See John Paul II's Visit,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/weekinreview/ideas-trends-how-some-american-catholics-see-john-paul-ii-s-visit.html,LAST week in Los Angeles Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago asked Pope John Paul II to understand the freedoms enjoyed by all Americans including members of the Roman Catholic Church We live in an open society where everyone prizes the freedom to speak his or her mind he said at John Pauls meeting with the nations 300 bishops They want to know the reasons why certain decisions are made and they feel free to criticize if they do not agree or are not satisfied with the explanations They see this as an integral part of the call to live their lives as responsible educated adults John Paul replied in an unusually adamant manner that it was a grave error to believe one could pick and choose among church teachings while still receiving the sacraments It has never been easy he admonished to accept the Gospel teaching in its entirety and it never will be Some Catholic liberals were heartened earlier in the week when the Pope seemed to offer encouragement to the sanctuary movement whose members have harbored illegal immigrants from Latin America But he made it clear that he remained unmoved by arguments that it is possible to dissent on divorce birth control the ordination of women as priests homosexuality and celibacy among the priesthood and still be a good Catholic Can the Popes visit make a moral difference to America Jennifer A Kingson and Sarah Lyall of The New York Times asked this and other questions of several prominent American Catholics Excerpts from their answers follow WILLIAM F BUCKLEY JR columnist novelist and editor of National Review I am obliged to think his visit can make a moral difference Otherwise we are consigned to believing that words have no power to influence benevolence none to bring emulation personal radiance without theatrical effect If all this were so it isnt only Jesus who would never have preached but also Shakespeare and Dante This doesnt say that all of a sudden the moral porosity of the American Catholic public let alone the American public is going to increase We have a high philanthropic society that has shown time after time that we are disposed to lift our moral sights What the Pope brings apart from his unimpeachable pedigree as vicar of Christ is a kind of spiritual integrity visible even in his physical features When he faces down a populist enthusiasm abortion for instance and shakes his head resolutely but with understanding we have to conclude that there are people out there who will stop for a moment to listen It is inconceivable that the popularity of the present Pope is exclusively the result of the position he occupies Thats why I think his message has a chance On some of his obiter dicta of this or that aspect of public policy one must remind oneself of the many fields in which the Holy Father is fallible To encourage the sanctuary movement without giving any thought to the consequences of doing so is to deny to Caesar that which is preeminently his namely the right to regulate immigration When the Pope speaks on questions that involve economics one understandably reaches over and switches that little button that delegates to the United Nations dispose of which permits them to turn off the earphones while affecting to listen The metaphor is appropriate because most of what the Pope says about economics is best said when the United Nations is your audience Inevitably some material simply does not reach the Popes crowded desk He cannot have been advised what would be the reaction to his consent to seeing Waldheim He cannot be aware of the research done in recent years on the causes of poverty in America Some of these causes are described in the Bible some are not ROBERT STONE novelist whose works include Children of Light and Dog Soldiers I think Catholics in America are getting tired of seeing pictures of the Pope greeting representatives of every possible racial and ethnic group  its a little like looking at Coolidge with his Indian war bonnet on Its an attitude that some theologians call triumphalist this ongoing royal pageantry It does get to be wearing While its always good for the morale of Catholics to have the Pope visit them there seems to be a lot more style than substance There was a lot of optimism when the Pope came in as the first nonItalian Pope in this century I think people looked to him to involve the church in history in a new and vital way Now I dont think theres very much serious enthusiasm for him  its rather coldly formal    People want to be addressed on the subject that troubles them most how they can translate Christianity into their daily lives Theyre trying to make some connection between the metaphysical world and their daily lives Thats the kind of leadership we want    What everybody would like a little more of is how to make sense of the Christian ethic as sexual people and as social people I think theres a lot he doesnt understand about the United States To see it from airports and stadiums is not the best way    I think he sees America as a rather bland materialistic place I think he is rather patronizing    He seems to imply that the wealth and selfsatisfaction of power and the demand for reforms are all of a piece  because we are blindly powerful and mindlessly wealthy we are calling for things like a married clergy a more flexible attitude toward sexual things What he seems to be saying here is Buck up and toe the line and dont be blinded by wealth and selfindulgence WILLIAM ALFRED Harvard humanities professor and playwright whose works include Hogans Goat Ive noticed when I see him on the news that he looks preoccupied worried I think hes as puzzled about us as some of us are about him    It isnt just this Pope Something has happened with the sense of an authoritative church since the second World War The Pope is called to really come to terms with whatever has happened with the Catholic idea the idea that we live in two worlds the secular and the religious That sense has diminished    Now a kind of liberalism pertains our pluralistic democracy has really shaken the church up If I were the Pope I would restore fixed Lent regulations I would also restore the Latin mass because the Latin mass can also be followed by a missal as it always was in the native language He ought to make it a church law that the sacrament of penance should be practiced every month Then he ought to put the private conduct of ones love  that is sexuality  on the conscience of the individual person instead of laying that down Im talking just about birth control He couldnt do that with people who dont love heterosexually MARY GORDON novelist whose works include Final Payments and Temporary Shelter I think a Pope could make a difference in the moral life of America but not this Pope    The Pope could say that anyone involved in the production of nuclear weapons is guilty of sin and liable for excommunication Anyone who is involved with abortion is liable for excommunication and he has said that with clarity He claims to be against nuclear weapons but he does not place any moral sanctions on those who produce them    I think his entire moral authority has been eroded because of his conduct with Waldheim Any moral pronunciation from anyone who calls a Nazi a man of peace is not something we can trust I think he thinks we Americans are all Protestants in disguise all fat cats and selfindulgent children and that it is his job to play the father    Hes also a very good actor he can make himself look confused when what hes really feeling probably is irritation Like Ronald Reagan he could have had a career as a B actor  he has this one look where he puts his hand on his head He looks great in vestments hes tremendously photogenic It seems to me we have the same papacy as we have a presidency Its all for the media    I think his pronouncements on the sanctuary movement are an example of his saying things that are easy and not difficult Why isnt he going down and confronting Duarte about why people from his country have to come to America I think it is difficult for Catholics who have been brought up with an authoritarian model to give up the idea of the allwise allknowing authoritarian father A great deal of them are in anguish His attitudes on sexuality are inimical to most Americans  you want to be part of the church but the church keeps telling you you cant be The rest of the world tells you it is a moral act to practice birth control responsibly It makes you feel crazy if you take it seriously BOWIE KUHN former commissioner of baseball now a lawyer in private practice In this time of divisions within the American church his visit symbolizes and reminds Americans of things which are important such as the worldwide unity of the church the determination of the church to hold fast to those fundamental teachings and precepts which it has held to over the centuries notwithstanding the ebb and flow of the vogues of popular thinking I think his visit also is important in that it reminds American Catholics  and probably others  of the importance of actively vigorously and physically helping the poor the destitute the sick whether they are AIDS victims the aged infants in the womb or fugitives    The remarks on the sanctuary movement werent exactly ones I was expecting But we started out as a land of sanctuary whether it was oppression from England or Russia or today from Haiti or other countries and I think he was reminding us of that He was looking for something to note in the American character KATHLEEN KENNEDY TOWNSEND environmental lawyer The best example of the Pope as a moral leader is what he has done in Poland where he has specifically defended those who risked imprisonment and death    In America the villains arent so obvious Theres a tendency in America to use religion to mask difficulty and pain Religion should not be used as a drug to make us feel good but should deepen the experience of human suffering Suffering can teach us the humility of St Francis and the courage of St Ignatius Loyola There is a great yearning for a sense of purpose in our lives MICHAEL NOVAK author of The Open Church and holder of the Jewett chair in Religion and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute The main theme that the Pope chose for his Pontificate is the primacy of the spirit that is the power of the human spirit in history Its something a Pole and those in Eastern Europe    know very well and something that every civilization thirsts for The world gets very little leadership of the spirit in a sophisticated and thoughtful way and thats what the Pope seems to be doing When I was at the UN after the Popes first visit the delegate from India told me how surprised and impressed his family and friends were by the outpouring of devotion and affection expressed for the Pope that they had seen on television They had thought from Western media that America was a secular place the degree of religiousness they could see with their eyes surprised them and they welcomed that    Its not just his talents Television demands a single person to focus on Its as if God created the papacy 1900 years ago in preparation for this moment SIDNEY CALLAHAN psychology professor at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry NY and president of the Association for the Rights of Catholics in the Church Pope John XXIII had a tremendous influence on the people of the world People really felt he loved God and cared about people and the world and finally he died so beautifully In his humanity and openness he has been a tremendous influence This Pope aspires to be a saint but he has a certain iron steely selfdramatizing quality that I think sometimes puts people off You have the sense that he wants to be a very holy person and transform the world for Christ but that he may be impeded by something within him I dont think he will be as influential as he would like to be I admire his will and his selfdiscipline I admire the impulse but I am not moved Many liberal Catholics myself included have put him in a rather interesting double bind We say he doesnt listen and then we criticize him for not telling us what we want to hear    Ive always felt since he grew up under the Nazis that his view of what the church should be is something of a guerrilla underground  you have to have secrecy hierarchy authority the absence of women a certain sense of the existential Thats a good way to run an underground but its no way to run a church JOSEPH A CALIFANO JR former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare now a lawyer in private practice The Pope can make a moral difference in terms of getting wealth distributed more equitably everything from resources to food  and by maintaining his insistence on the unique value of the human being and human dignity which is a critical problem in a society so big and so bureaucratic everywhere in the world    He has no troops he can deal with those underlying moral issues in a way nobody else can Hes trying to save the world not raise money or get land There are very few people in the world who only do this
THE HISTORIAN: 'A WRESTLER WITH THE ANGEL',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/books/the-historian-a-wrestler-with-the-angel.html,THE historian is both discoverer and creator To the uniqueness of his role we have a clue in the very word history which means both the course of the past and the legible account of the past The historian is always trying to reduce or remove that ambiguity If he is successful he leads his readers to take  or mistake  his account for what was really there The historian sets himself a dangerous even an impossible task In the phrase of the great Dutch historian J H Huizinga he is a wrestler with the angel It is the angel of death who makes his work necessary yet destined never to be definitive If man were not mortal we would not be deprived of the living testimony of the actors and so required to give new form to the receding infinity From my own work I will describe the historians quest And I will suggest both the universal obstacles to recovery of the past and some special resources opportunities and temptations for the historian in our own time Historians can rediscover the past only by the relics it has left for the present They try to convince us that the relics they have examined and interpreted in their narrative are a reliable sample of the experience people really had But how reliable are the remains of the past as clues to what was really there My life as a historian has brought me vivid reminders of how partial is the remaining evidence of the whole human past how casual and how accidental is the survival of its relics One of my first shocks came while exploring the American experience in colonial times in my effort to recapture the meaning of religion to the settlers of New England Their basic vehicle of religious instruction was The New England Primer This the chief text of compulsory education in early Massachusetts carried a full rhymed alphabet  from Adam In Adams Fall we sinned all to Zaccheus  along with moral aphorisms fragments of the Old Testament and the text of prayers including the familiar Now I lay me down to sleep This influential work which first appeared about 1690 became the bestselling New England schoolbook and had sold some three million copies within the next century Benjamin Franklin who knew a commercial opportunity when he saw one made a tidy profit publishing his own secularized version FOR the flavor of New England religion I went in search of original copies of the Primer but they were hard to find By contrast I found it easy to consult the heavy tomes of Puritan theology These volumes kept in the rarebook rooms of university libraries were often in mint condition sometimes even with uncut pages Modern scholars pore over such works in plush bibliophilic comfort to discover what the early Puritans were really thinking about religion This set me thinking about the limits of historical discovery I had a similar experience when I came to the early 19th century trying to learn about American heroes of the age and what people thought of them I turned at once to the popular Crockett Almanacs These were pamphlets of wide appeal published in the name of Davy Crockett 17861836 the man of little education and little respect for book learning who said the rules of spelling were contrary to nature Besides recipes and useful everyday hints for health and crops they recounted Crocketts astonishing feats wrestling men and alligators along with legends of other frontier prodigies like Mike Fink Daniel Boone and Kit Carson The earliest of these almanacs in 1835 offered an autobiography which Crockett supposedly wrote soon before his death Between 1835 and 1856 some 50 such almanacs poured out of Nashville New York Boston Philadelphia and elsewhere by the tens of thousands in the name of Davy Crockett or his heirs Embellished by crude woodcuts on cheap paper these almanacs were carried in saddlebags slipped into hip pockets handed about Western inns and bars and around campfires as Americans moved west But by the mid20th century they had become rare and costly collectors items A dramatic contrast for the historian of American hero worship was the monumental official life of George Washington authorized by his nephew Bushrod Washington and written by Chief Justice John Marshall The work came to five volumes sold by subscription at the then considerable price of 3 a volume Even the flamboyant Parson Weems who put his best efforts into it could not make it sell And when the first volume of the muchtouted project reached subscribers in 1804 it quickly established itself as the publishing catastrophe of the age John Adams charitably characterized this as not a book at all but rather a Mausoleum 100 feet square at the base and 200 feet high History justified Adamss description because the volumes survived as unread as they were unreadable Today of course it is much more convenient for the scholar to mine the elegant bound volumes of Marshall than to handle the ragged halflegible fragments of Davy Crockett These two episodes of my own research led me to a rather troubling hypothesis The Law of the Survival of the Unread  the more widely used a document the more likely it is to have disappeared or been destroyed Is the historian then the victim of a diabolical solipsism Is there an inverse relation between the probability of a documents surviving and its value as evidence of the daily life of the age from which it survives To this troublesome law of historical evidence there are countless exceptions But the exceptions themselves are also reminders of the casual and accidental causes of preservation survival and accessibility These only confirm our doubts that there is any positive correlation between survival and importance as clues to the past Survival is chancy whimsical and unpredictable Yet it is not impossible to list some of the biases of survival They apply not only to documents and printed matter but to all kinds of relics Survival of the Durable and That Which Is Not Removed or Displaced While this has the sound of tautology its consequences are not always noticed  the tendency toward emphasis on the monumental on experience recorded in writing or in books Since religions are a deliberate effort to transcend the transience of the individual human life monuments of religion are often more durable than other monuments Tombs burial objects mummies temples churches and pyramids tend to skew our view of the past They give a prominence to religion in the relics of the past that it may not actually have had in the lives people lived A contrast with monumental houses of religion are the simple dwellings of the people who did or did not worship there Chartres Cathedral survives in its solid 13thcentury glory but the mud and wattle and wood houses of the citizens of Chartres surrounding it have been many times replaced In the United States this bias obscures some of the peculiar achievements of a mobile and technologically progressive civilization One of the most characteristic architectural innovations in the United States is the balloon frame house This American invention which appeared in Chicago about 1833 was notable not for its durability but for its ease and speed of construction Houses built by nailing together light timbers instead of by the mortise and tenon of heavy beams were put up quickly by people without the carpenters skill Such houses were taken down and their frames transported by wagon or riverboat to the next stopping place in the transient booming West While the country mansions of the Dutch patroons of New York and plantation mansions of Virginia and Maryland survive where are the balloon frames This momentous American invention whose 20thcentury products surround us today has hardly entered the historical record Survival of the Collected and the Protected What Goes in Government Files We emphasize political history and government in the life of the past partly because governments keep records while families and other informal groups seldom do Yet informal groups  for example the anonymous wagon trains that crossed the continent  were among the most remarkable and most characteristic of American communities Much of the peculiarly American experience which has had this voluntary spontaneous character has eluded historians The volunteer enthusiasms of ministers and their congregations and the haphazard philanthropy of wealthy citizens leave few official records A democratic society like ours a community of voluntary mobile communities leaves a random report of its past Survival of Objects That Are Not Used or That Have a High Intrinsic Value It is not only in printed matter that rarity and scarcity induce survival European palaces churches and now their museums display the jeweled and filigreed clocks and watches of early modern times But the special timekeeping triumph of 19thcentury America was the inexpensive household clock and then the dollar watch the wonder of European visitors These dollar watches were not made for ease of repair and seemed not worth repairing They seldom find their way into museums Similarly the elegantly engraved muskets with which European princes and their hunting companions enjoyed their leisure can be admired in many European museums But the plain Kentucky rifle which was the early westwardmoving pioneers weapon of defense and staff of life was not preserved as an object of beauty Survival of the Academically Classifiable and the Dignified Teachers teach the subjects in which they have been instructed The trivium grammar logic and rhetoric and quadrivium arithmetic geometry astronomy and music which composed the seven liberal arts of the medieval universities were an exhaustive catalogue of what students were expected to learn Geography for example had no place in the medieval scheme We must piece together their notions of the earth its shapes and its dimensions from works of theology along with the ephemeral maps portolans and planispheres used by navigators traders pirates and empire builders When geographic knowledge was valuable merchandise the cartographic secrets of shorter safer passages to remote treasuretroves of pepper spice and precious gems were classified information Now they are hidden from us as well In the field of literature this academic conservatism has perpetuated the study of familiar classics but left much of what many people read stigmatized as subliterature beneath the interest of serious students Survival of Printed and Other Materials Surrounding Controversies What has passed for the study of the history of religion in America should more accurately be described as the history of religious controversies The silent or spoken prayers of the devout leave few records behind But the disputations of theologians the acrimony of the religious academies and the resolutions of church councils pour out print Then it is these disputes that command the interest and the ingenuity of historians of religion while the passions of the heart and the yearnings of the Godstruck spirit however constant and universal remain private and invisible Similarly if we go in quest of the daily eating and drinking habits of early Americans it is not easy to find records Yet the history of the temperance movement and the prohibition of alcoholic beverages has left an abundant literature to arrest the attention of historians The daily sexual habits of those who conform to the prevalent mores are seldom recorded and have rarely been chronicled The history of sexual conduct has tended to become a record of deviants of contraception and abortion of polygamy and homosexuality The history of law enforcement and obedience to law eludes us while our shelves are filled with detective stories and the chronicles of crime Survival of the SelfServing The Psychopathology of Diarists and Letter Writers Historians in professional training are urged to seek records by participants in events preferably those made at the time or soon after So there is a natural tendency to rely on diaries and letters The quirks and quiddities of the obsessive diarist Samuel Pepys 16331703 loom in the foreground of the social history of England in the 17th century In America we inevitably lean heavily on the diaries and letters of William Byrd 16741744 a witty but atypical planterpolitician and on the memoirs of the articulate plantation tutor Philip Vickers Fithian And we make much of the copious 19thcentury diary written in the barely legible minuscule hand of the observant New Yorker George Templeton Strong or the gargantuan confessions of the eccentric Arthur Inman Of course intimate feelings interest the historian But does not our hunger for the recorded word exaggerate the unusual point of view of those who happened to be diarists and letter writers Are we victims willingly or not of a Casanova syndrome that puts us at the mercy of the most articulate boasters of the past HOW will the rise of the telephone and the decline of letter writing correct or newly distort our recorded past When President Thomas Jefferson wanted to instruct his Secretary of State James Madison he would commonly write him a note which remains for us But when President Lyndon Johnson wanted to instruct Secretary of State Dean Rusk he would more often have used the telephone Consequently when historians find a memorandum from President Johnson to Secretary Rusk they will wonder whether the record was made not to guide action but to convey a desired impression to future historians President Nixons notorious effort to use the new electronic technology to provide a taped chronicle of his work in the Oval Office reveals the new biases opportunities and risks  and reminds us of how much we lack of the earlier historical record Meanwhile the flood of press releases and pseudoevents expressly created to be reported further dilutes and confuses the record Survival of the Victorious Point of View The Success Bias The history of inventions we read today seems to have become the story of successful inventors Eli Whitney Isaac Merritt Singer Henry Ford Thomas A Edison and other lucky ones leave a vivid record But the countless anonymous experimenters the frustrated tinkerers who nearly made it disappear How many of their efforts ought to be part of the story A dominant theme in the writing of American history has been the filling of the continent the consolidating of a great nation But the desire to secede to move away from the larger political community might have become the leitmotif Just as the Puritans came to America as seceders from Britain so the westward movers in the 19th century were seceders from the heavily settled increasingly urban Atlantic coastal nation If the South had won the Civil War if the Republic of Texas had remained independent the earlier American settlers too would have continued to shine not as nation builders but as courageous seceders Survival of the Epiphenomenal Often people write books and read them because they cannot personally experience what is described We often remain uncertain whether writers were recording their experience or escaping it In my own efforts to describe American manners and household customs I have been tantalized by this ambiguity Emily Posts Etiquette first published in 1922 and frequently revised thereafter was so popular that her name became a synonym for proper behavior The style of private entertaining she prescribed during the Great Depression in the lean 1930s still resembled what Scott Fitzgerald depicted in the luxuriant age of The Great Gatsby 1925 And her books remained popular Was this because people expected to follow her economically obsolete impractical advice or because they enjoyed fantasizing about how they never could or could no longer afford to entertain The answers to these inward private questions may be beyond the historians ken Knowledge Survives and Accumulates but Ignorance Disappears A medieval folk tale reports that a young alchemist was once told that if he recited a certain formula he could transform lead into silver and copper into gold The only condition was that while reciting his formula he must never be thinking of a white elephant He learned the formula and tried reciting it Unfortunately he could never make it work  for all the while he was earnestly trying not to think of a white elephant The problem of latterday historians is much like that of the young alchemist For our minds are furnished with all the accumulated knowledge and experience of the ages since the period of the past we are trying to recapture The modern globe of the earth is so firmly fixed in our vision we find it hard to imagine the threecontinent planet with a surface only oneseventh water on which Columbus thought he was sailing As we try to relive the experience of Americans hastening across the continent in the early 19th century we see them traversing the fertile Great Plains destined to be the granary of a great nation But they thought they were crossing what on their maps was the Great American Desert Some even sought camels to help their passage How can we recapture their ignorance Yet if we do not we cannot really share their fears and their courage It is the sheerest folly to believe that we can ever know the extent or the boundaries of our ignorance Or that we can conquer the biases of survival by some new technology We transfer inflammable selfdestructive nitrate motion picture films of the years before 1950 to acetate film and so avoid the immediate catastrophes of combustion But how long will the acetate film survive We have less than a century of use to guide us WE should be chastened in our hope to master the whole real past by the ironic comprehensiveness of the oldest records of civilization We know more about some aspects of daily life in the Babylon of 3000 BC than we do about daily life in parts of Europe or America 100 years ago By a happy accident ancient Babylonians wrote not on paper but on the clay they found underfoot Our grand dividend is thousands of tablets recording everything from codes of laws and religious texts to teachers copybooks the notes of schoolchildren the records of war booty recipes scientific works and receipts for the sale of slaves and cattle The messages we receive from that remote past were neither intended for us nor chosen by us but are the casual relics of climate geography and human activity They too remind us of the whimsical dimensions of our knowledge and the limits of our powers of discovery The historiancreator refuses to be defeated by the biases of survival For he chooses defines and shapes his subject to provide a reasonably truthful account from miscellaneous remains Of course he must use the social sciences but he must transcend dogmas and theories Like other literary artists and unlike the advancing social scientist he is not engaged merely in revising his predecessors He adds to our inheritance At his best he is not accumulating knowledge that becomes obsolete but creating a work with a life of its own While Adam Smith survives in the reflected light of Ricardo and Marx and Keynes Gibbon shines with a light all his own The truth the historian in any age finds in the past becomes part of our literary treasure Inevitably the historian is torn between his efforts to create anew what he sees was really there and the urgent shifting demands of the living audience His motto could be St Augustines Credo quia impossibilia  I believe because it is impossible At his best he remains a wrestler with the angel Adapted from an essay in Hidden History Exploring Our Secret Past by Daniel J Boorstin selected and edited by Daniel J Boorstin and Ruth F Boorstin a Cornelia and

A NATION IN DECLINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/magazine/a-nation-in-decline.html,DECLINE OF A NATION OR a society is a provocative historical problem In Rome it is associated with external pressure from the barbarians and the inability of the empires agricultural rim to offer firm resistance In the ancient Greek cities of Asia Minor it can be traced to the silting up of harbors closing them to access by sea In the Aztec empire of Mexico it was the invasion of ruthless Europeans In China it is a long story In the United States who knows One certainly feels a deteriorating ethic in many spheres Our Government is beset by incompetence our officials display an inability to execute policy efficiently or within the law The policymaking apparatus itself appears to have broken down with the chain of command in the Governments executive branch reduced to a meaningless flow chart Such incoherence and disarray in policy and its implementation result in turn from the publics unthinking acceptance of image over substance in its choice of Government officers Incompetence is a companion of decline because decline has no goal when people do not care and have no goal in view they do not function at their utmost They grow lax and accept defeat They will go on producing babies for an everincreasing population because that is easy but they will not control the poisoning of air and water for preservation of the national health One of the members of the Congressional panel investigating the Irancontra affair stated that the chief issue to emerge from the hearings was incompetency in government I entirely agree with him and had been thinking the same thing myself I define incompetence as sloppy and ragged performance that ends in unwanted result Competence the obverse is the ability to do work expertly neatly and correctly without foolish mistakes Incompetence can be of two kinds first poor performance the inability to accomplish a given task without making a mess of it like a person who washes the dishes and leaves them greasy and second poor thinking  also known as stupidity  when a person adheres inflexibly to preconceived notions and fails to discern a meaningful pattern in facts or circumstances that stare him in the face and hence fails to act sensibly in relation to them This was the kind of incompetence that Neville Chamberlain took along with his umbrella to face Hitler at Munich Both kinds will be present in a society in decline And massive incompetence of both kinds can be seen clearly in the case of the frigate Stark After being warned the ship could not manage for reasons still not fully explained to shoot at a hostile plane approaching it with intent to attack The captain was not even on the bridge at the time of the attack and the antimissile defense equipment was not in operation This was an example of physical incompetence on the part of the Starks commanders But it was owed to the mental incompetence of the Defense Department staff at home which dispatched to the Persian Gulf a frigate not designed for independent battle duty in waters where active selfdefense could be expected but as a component of a carrier force Consequently the Stark could not or did not defend itself In the case of the Stark no one was tried by courtmartial to establish a clear verdict of responsibility In 1756 in an analagous situation the British Navy sent an inadequate and poorly manned fleet to fight off a French attack on Minorca When the commander Adm John Byng lost the island through a halfhearted defense he was tried and condemned for not doing his utmost and then executed by firing squad I am not advocating that we imitate the procedure  the exaggerated penalty did more to harm the Royal Navy than six Byngs on the bridge Nevertheless persons in positions of command military or civil must be held to standards of competent performance if our ships are to hold the sea and our policies not be held to ridicule In the Irancontra affair the most egregious case of incompetence leaving us in shocked wonderment is the sale and delivery of arms to Iran without obtaining fulfillment of their side of the bargain  which was according to Rear Adm John M Poindexter a straight trade of arms for hostages At first only one hostage was released then two more trickled out but then three more were seized and are still being held Our arms bought us a total of one recovered hostage The mental incompetence of our selfappointed operators was clear In a situation of their own creation these agents of covert operations entered an antique land with no more serious thought than tourists off a cruise ship with no knowledge of the language or the culture of the Levant no acquaintance with the ancient skills of the bazaar unprepared to do anything but botch the job I quite understand and approve President Reagans desire to bring the hostages out for their sake and for his But why on earth did his agents knowing his urgency and informed that their intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar was a liar and unreliable not require some down payment a hostage on the table so to speak or some evidence of good faith in the bargain before delivering the arms Unaware or unconcerned President Reagan benignly kept these offthereservation adventurers in position and sanctioned their exploits With no one actively in charge the National Security Council ran wild in support of the contras in the name of patriotism They might just as well have been bombing abortion clinics and calling it patriotism because abortion was something the President was known to oppose Reagan was the security councils chief but his interest in the position was lackadaisical and he apparently was oblivious to its responsibilities That may have been due to age When a person reaches 70 or 75 consequences seem less important and someone carrying heavy responsibilities will have a tendency to let things go in the comfortable belief that they must end up in someone elses lap The report of the Tower Commission concluding that Mr Reagan is a handsoff President is widely accepted because it fits and because of the statement let slip by Secretary of State George P Shultz during the hearings that he obtained an interview with Reagan when the President happened to be in Washington This stays with me as the single most memorable remark of the hearings Reagans attitude resembles to some extent the easygoing acceptance by the Aztec emperor Montezuma of the invasion of the Spanish conquistadors in 1519 He bestowed gifts on them even received them in his court His downfall and death soon followed at their hands LAWLESSNESS OFTEN accompanies incompetence When the President authorized the arms sale to Iran without informing Congress he may have violated the Arms Export Control Act According to that law in a transaction involving the export of arms by a private manufacturer the State Department has the authority to decide whether the release is advisable and politically suitable If the arms have become part of United States stock in the possession of the Defense Department as were the TOW missiles that found their way to Iran the export requires an authorizing document signed by the Secretary of Defense or an officer of his department The act requires that Congress be notified of significant sales of arms abroad and that arms not be sold to a customer for transfer to a third party Thus in authorizing the sale in his finding of Jan 17 1986 President Reagan twice ignored that law by failing to notify Congress and by using Israel for the transfer to Iran This must have been done consciously  unless he is given to signing documents with his eyes closed Lawlessness appears again as a twin of incompetence in the Reagan Administrations mining of Nicaraguan waters in 1984 a belligerent act against a country with which we were not and are not at war ordered by our Government as a whole not by the outriders of the National Security Council What was gained A hash of our Good Neighbor policy and greater turmoil than before in Central America  hardly the record of a competent government Pundits talk about the need for legislation to tighten our rules of conduct within the Government to prevent any recurrence of an aberration like the Irancontra case But all the rules are already in place What is missing is compliance You cannot pass a law it has been said to stop people from breaking the law Next we have the extraordinary spectacle of the American Government exerting diplomatic pressure on friendly nations not to sell arms to Iran while we were simultaneously sending official American envoys  Robert C McFarlane and Oliver L North  to Teheran to negotiate just such an arms sale by ourselves for the sake of improved dialogue with Iran and for release of the hostages Is this coherent government The open expression of divided opinion among citizens is the virtue of our democracy the divided policy to which it may lead is the hazard Because of the divisions agents of Government take it upon themselves to act independently with a quite astonishing inattention to ordinary lines of command despite all their loyal readiness to do a headstand if ordered and salute smartly in response an athletic trick when both hands are braced on the floor THE SADDEST RECORDS IN THIS affair after the Presidents seem to me to be those of the Secretaries of State and Defense For Shultz and Caspar W Weinberger to say that they strongly disapproved of the arms sale to Iran and to do nothing effective to restrain it and then to claim they knew nothing about it which I cannot believe can only be labeled pathetic  for men in their position The most outspoken action the two could have taken would have been simply to refuse to give their departments license for the sale of arms and upon this refusal to resign  as former Secretary of State Cyrus R Vance did over the attempted rescue of the earlier hostages in Iran as British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden did in 1938 over Chamberlains rapprochement to Fascist Italy Ministerial resignation renouncing the important scream of a motorcycle police escort and accepting exile from the golden circle of insiders is a difficult and infrequent choice Secretary Shultz says he offered his resignation three times to the President but in terms that could not have been very firm or convincing for he is still here He based his desire to quit not on any principle of policy but because he was cut out of decisionmaking and kept uninformed was being deceived by the White House staff and came to feel a sense of estrangement from the White House and from associates at the National Security Council As the State Departments chief knowing he was being misinformed surely Shultz should have exerted a stronger hand to put an end to unauthorized initiatives Otherwise he would have been left presiding over a department of anarchy and futility The failure by Weinberger and Shultz to say anything public of their disapproval of Reagans signed finding approving the arms sale seems to me a disillusioning indication of their independent judgment as Cabinet officers They are or should be advisers to not minions of the President My country right or wrong has a certain nobility of sentiment but our President right or wrong signals the collapse of constitutional government A disquieting result of the revelation of the bizarre disorder in American Government will be the effect it will have on the relationship to us of other nations friendly and unfriendly allies and foes The former will find it difficult to know where to locate the source of American policy and how to identify the author of policy on whom they should rely Uncertain what or whom to count on allies will be less inclined to want attachment to us in a firm relationship Uneasiness has shown itself already in the initial reluctance of states benefitting from our protection of their oil tankers in the Persian Gulf to aid us in mine sweeping Foes on the other hand seeking to take advantage of our internal disorders will use them for whatever machinations and mischiefs they can employ TO MANY AMERICANS the most disturbing revelation of the Irancontra fiasco I think is the degree to which the occupants of important political office seem to be able to distract or divert policy in any direction they personally think it should go even when contrary to Congressional prohibition What assurance have we that some extremist from what is wistfully called the intelligence community will not one day veer off in a wild turn of which his superiors will blandly tell us afterward they knew nothing This brings me to Oliver North and Ollie mania North is unquestionably the most striking public personality to take over television since the wonderful Sam Ervin the Senator from North Carolina who chaired the Watergate hearings But oh the difference Senator Ervin was the perfect elder statesman inspiring confidence expressing truth and integrity in every lift of his white eyebrows and murmur of his drawl North with his good looks sharp military appearance his poise his excellent grammar and diction and his cando spirit is if perhaps a little too slick the ideal young American activist An attractive figure he could not fail to conquer the viewers But the reality underneath Norths heroic exterior is that of a meddlesome overgrown Boy Scout with streaks of megalomania whose activities rather less than heroic caused more trouble for his country than did all of Nixons CREEP The Olliemania phenomenon  which now reaches from Oliver North Tshirts to clubs promoting North for President  demonstrates a distressing popular development that I consider the main point of the Iran affair deeper than the issue of incompetence in government It is the publics acceptance of the pictured image without regard to the reality underneath The problem is serious It has caused us to put in the Presidency a person who appears likable and avuncular on the screen but is not otherwise equipped for the White House I need not say that this is the result of a visual  which is to say a nonthinking culture inculcated by the age of youknowwhat Television has been a great boon to the ill and lonely but the degree to which it has impaired the brain cells of the general population has not been measured A visual culture has important implications for government The subjects of the Bourbon monarchy were so overcome by the mystique of the court curled wigs and elegancies  that they allowed the Bourbons to reign in decadence until revolution became inevitable Today television has become our monarch It determines more and more our choice of candidates for office and the persons we now elect to exercise the government we live under As the world grows more complex and more in need of expert handling in foreign relations we must not rest content with persons who merely look good on television As we learned from the hearings they and their appointees are not the most competent caretakers of national security THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL officers admitted lying to and misleading of Congress is somehow less shocking than their incompetence because hateful though it is to say falsehood and false dealing have become so much a part of American life that we almost take them for granted I recently saw on television a survey of airline delays and cancellations Corporate officers with the same nonchalant admission of lying shown by Poindexter and North acknowledged that their companies issued false statements of flight times  showing a shorter time between given points than their competitors  so that they would appear more favorably on travel agents timetables and would thus obtain the most bookings Though not horrendous in itself the fact of its being acknowledged so frankly and openly in the same insouciant tone as the National Security Council admissions gives one the feeling that false dealing is now the prevailing element of American life and may account for the sense of decline we feel in the American condition This condition was clearly exhibited in the Irancontra hearings and in every morning newspaper which brings us along with our orange juice and coffee news of yet another municipal or Federal official indicted for or charged with wrongdoing of one kind or another from the nations highest judicial officer down to the cop on the block It does seem that the knowledge of a difference between right and wrong is absent from our society as if it had floated away on a shadowy night after the last World War So remote is the concept that even to speak of right and wrong marks one to the younger generation as oldfashioned reactionary and out of touch I choose that war as the turning point in public morality It is my belief that the Nazi years have been underrated as a milestone in history marking the onset of a continuing period of interpersonal violence in the 20th century Comparable crimes have been known in other times although not with quite the same deliberate officially pursued purpose So much evil was perpetrated by the Germans and callously accepted by our own and other nations that harm done to fellow human beings began to appear normal and there was a consequent failure to regard wrongdoing in general as out of bounds and punishable Killing and meaningless mass murder without affect as the psychologists say and brutality in unspeakable terms like the man who cut off the arms of the woman he raped and the other men who for hire slashed the face of a model have become too frequent occurrences in contemporary life Whether a national decline has ever been initiated by a habit of violence would require a lifetime of study to obtain the evidence I think a good case can be made for the Ottoman Turks after their conquest of Constantinople in 1453 Some 400 years after that victory the onceallpowerful Ottoman empire mired in an orgy of atrocities in Bulgaria had become the Sick Man of Europe and had earned Gladstones famous peroration from his 1876 pamphlet The Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East on fell satanic orgies    gross and incurable misgovernment    unbridled and bestial lust    fiendish misuse of power of    loathsome tyranny    There was not a criminal in a European gaol not a cannibal in the South Sea Islands whose indignation would not rise at a recital of Turkish crimes    Let it be over Let them clear out of Europe with    their Bimbashis and their Yuzbashis    one and all bag and baggage    for nothing less can bring relief    to the overcharged emotion of a shuddering world One cannot resist such a gorgeous example of invective by a master of the art when intoxicated as Disraeli said with the exuberance of his own verbosity Granted a specter at whom cannibals shuddered is not a fate one necessarily foresees for the United States but todays climate of bloody violence is not reassuring OUR ELECTORAL CHOICES now become crucial and one hopes they will be founded next time on a basis more mature than the televisedTelePrompTerartificial images packaged by professional fundraisers and advertising companies Maturity and education are long slow processes Although our current disarray is urgent we shall not achieve a more mature public opinion overnight especially against worshipers of the populace who insist there is no cause for worry because the voice of the people is always right That is nonsense It is no more right than would be the voice of a herd of sheep  if it had one The reelection of Ronald Reagan by popular choice in 1984 was not right but disastrous I do not understand a foreign visitor said to me at the time Everywhere I go everyone tells me how harmful and inadequate Mr Reagan is as President and yet assures me he is certain to be reelected Why is that so All I could tell him was that the American people in the era of television with the heavy hand of advertising exerted upon them from the cradle are not now very smart in their political understanding What is needed  and God knows how it may be achieved is more political sense in the American citizen One improvement would be to prohibit packaged 30second spots on television by political candidates We should permit only live spontaneous appearances of a minimum duration of two minutes to allow us more realistic ideas of the candidates This would be only a tiny beginning and much more must be done to put sense into the electorate We have to recognize that where the buck stops in this crazy Irancontra affair is here on the doorstep of the American people Somehow we must learn to do better if more and perhaps more dangerous mischief is not to revisit us A peculiar vacuum exists in American public opinion not wheres the beef but wheres the outrage Wheres the anger that ought to have met the deaths of 241 United States marines in the truckbombing in Beirut through the failure by officers of the station to block the road Wheres the anger over the 37 deaths on the Stark And now wheres the outrage over the disclosures of misconduct and incompetence in Government by public officials of the highest rank Those deaths and illegalities excited hardly a tremor but the amorous peccadilloes of Gary Hart generated as much excitement largely due to male jeolousy I suspect as if Marilyn Monroe had returned to earth and was found living in the Taj Mahal The passionate interest the Gary Hart episode aroused in the public contrasted with the flaccid reaction to lost lives and broken laws illustrates the shallowness and frivolity of popular opinion If the American people do not grow angry when their sons lives are sacrificed to official negligence or when statutes are casually violated by the caretakers of the nations security one cannot expect any change to a steadier Government that commands more respect Anger when anger is due is necessary for self respect and for the respect of our nation by others What has become of American wits What has become of the America of Washington Adams and Jefferson What has become of national self respect not to mention common decency Perhaps the last should be left out of the discussion because common decency is not considered to be a necessary component of realpolitik in foreign affairs To raise the level of public understanding from frivolity to a readiness to take serious things seriously will require a great and concerted national effort  if like the problem of controlling AIDS we can figure out how it may be done Until it is we shall not soon retrieve coherent national policy or the rule of law
THE PAPAL VISIT; Pope Condemns Abortion in U.S. As He Ends Visit,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/us/the-papal-visit-pope-condemns-abortion-in-us-as-he-ends-visit.html,Pope John Paul II ending his visit to the United States today sternly condemned the practice of abortion in America arguing that the nation must defend all human life if it wants to enjoy justice and freedom The ultimate test of Americas greatness is the way you treat every human being but especially the weakest and most defenseless ones those as yet unborn he said at a farewell ceremony with Vice President Bush at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport The Pope spent the earlier part of the day in Americas industrial midsection meeting his fellow Poles at a rally this morning in Hamtramck a heavily Polish city within the city of Detroit then delivering a speech in downtown Detroit on the challenges to social justice in the modern world [ Excerpts page 31 ] America Defend Life Having already delivered 47 addresses in nine cities John Paul saved some of his strongest words for his last moments on United States soil After extolling the dynamic nation and its warm and welcoming people John Paul turned to the issue of abortion If you want equal justice for all and true freedom and lasting peace he said then America defend life from conception until natural death The Pope has restated the position of the Roman Catholic Church on abortion several times in his 10day tour but this was the first time he made it the major theme of a speech depicting the issue as the most important test of the identity of the United States as a free nation A private meeting between John Paul and Vice President Bush was arranged before the formal departure ceremony From Detroit John Paul went to Canada where he will spend a day in the Northwest Territories before returning to Rome The Pope had also explored the United States role as a great nation earlier in the day in his speech on social justice He spoke of the nations international responsibilities and warned that it could not solve its own problems unless it helped the whole world achieve peace and prosperity America the Powerful As has happened repeatedly on the Popes trip the crowds that came out to see him today were a fraction of what had been expected The police here said that only about 30000 people went to Hamtramck to hear him laud the cultural heritage of PolishAmericans Preparations had been made for 10 times as many And despite an appearance by the singer Aretha Franklin before the Pope arrived only about 75000 people came to Hart Plaza downtown to hear the Pope speak of social justice This morning surrounded by the highrise towers of downtown Detroit John Paul laid down a forceful challenge Dear friends America is a very powerful country The amount and quality of your achievements are staggering By virtue of your unique positions as citizens of this nation you are placed before a choice and you must choose He said his audience could either close in on yourselves and enjoy the fruits of your own form of progress and try to forget about the rest of the world or you may choose to live up to your responsibilities that your own history and accomplishments place on your shoulders US Cleric Is Disappointed Since he arrived in Miami 10 days ago Pope John Paul has emphasized this countrys need to fulfill responsibilities brought on by its great wealth and power But today he posed the argument as a matter of selfinterest and over the course of his address he used the language of a diplomat a business school professor as well as that of a priest The Hart Plaza speech on social justice had been described in advance by Vatican officials as one of the most important of the whole trip But it broke no significant new ground in the welldeveloped social doctrine of the church An American clergyman expressed disappointment over the degree to which the speech repeated familiar themes A church official traveling with the Pope asking not to be identified said the speech had been one of the last to be completed and was difficult to write Much of the text was drawn from a speech the Pope had intended to deliver to the United Nations General Assembly before a stop in New York City was ruled out for logistical reasons the official said The United States Catholic Conference had publicly announced that the speech would mark a high point for American Catholics seeking to put into effect a pastoral letter on economic justice issued by United States bishops last November In his speech John Paul made no reference to the pastoral letter which was a major initiative by the American church hierarchy involving three years of work Technology and Injustice In Hart Plaza John Paul stood 35 feet above the street on a platform made of construction scaffolding Some modern technological developments are potential sources of social injustice he said Speaking in a city where the modernization of the automobile industry has eliminated thousands of jobs John Paul listed the introduction of robotics and the necessary adaptation of industrial plants as developments that can produce undue hardship for many either temporarily or more permanently The theme of his speech however was that all of the challenges faced by modern society from racism to the decay of family life must be seen in a global context Without implying in any way that domestic or national problems do not exist any more  and they most certainly do  it becomes ever more evident that such local or national problems and their solutions are fundamentally linked with realities that transcend the boundaries of countries he said Spreading pollution instant communications and the growth of world trade were among the developments he cited to justify his conclusion that any decision that is envisaged in the political economic or social sphere must be considered within the context of worldwide repercussions John Paul spoke at length about the positive role of the United Nations in promoting the kind of new worldwide solidarity that he argued was the only proper response to growing interdependence The United Nations he argued can serve as an example at a critical moment We are given the unique chance for the first time in human history to make a decisive contribution to the building up of a true world community the Pope said The awareness that we are linked in common destiny is becoming stronger
"In Un-Socratic Exchanges, Bork Delineates Several Selves",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/weekinreview/in-un-socratic-exchanges-bork-delineates-several-selves.html,TWICE last week in the process of repackaging himself as a moderate Judge Robert H Bork a hero to the right for thundering loud and long against the modern activist liberal Supreme Court parsed a distinction for the senators of the Judiciary Committee who are considering his nomination to the Supreme Court In a classroom nobody gets hurt the 60yearold former professor of law at Yale said In a courtroom someone always gets hurt Presenting himself in a grueling week of testimony as a model of apolitical judicial restraint with no ideological agenda and great respect for precedent content to leave undisturbed most of the dozens of decisions he has assailed Judge Bork and his supporters argued that many of his controversial writings were academic musings of marginal relevance to what he would do if confirmed A courtroom he said calls for a great deal more caution and circumspection Opponents pointed out that what he has been writing about is what the Supreme Court should do and that he has often and recently suggested far less respect for precedent Supporters pointed out that Louis D Brandeis generally regarded as one of the greatest Supreme Court Justices was attacked with much the same ferocity as Judge Bork With the tone of the hearings careering from dull dissection of arcane legal theories to crackling exchanges charged with politics and sometimes profundity the nominee came across to many senators as a man of character great intelligence and dignity with flashes of humor  but one whose surprising revisions of some controversial past positions now made his candor a major issue Some senators expressed dismay about views to which the nominee had adhered including his denunciation in 1973 of the Supreme Court decision that recognized a right to an abortion There was also skepticism among undecided senators about his recantations and qualifications of some controversial past positions on such key issues as sex discrimination free speech and privacy Opponents spoke of confirmation conversions allegedly motivated by concerns in the Bork camp that he would seem extreme to some senators and television viewers if he stuck to positions he has taken in past writings But supporters praised the nominees account of his long intellectual evolution and recent shifts in positions as evidence of openmindedness giving him opportunities to reiterate his point that as a Justice he would be less speculative than he had been in the classroom Reading Two Records In the main Judge Borks opponents concentrated their efforts on trying to skewer the nominee with his own offthebench words and some of his more controversial judicial decisions Their main emphasis was on his writings and speeches since the late 1960s assailing dozens of Supreme Court precedents that expanded individual rights including those recognizing constitutional rights to abortion and privacy and protecting some advocacy of revolutionary violence Judge Borks defenders stressed his stellar credentials as Solicitor General from 1973 to 1977 and as a Federal appellate judge since 1982 They noted several decisions in which he energetically enforced civil rights and First Amendment freedoms That record they argued places him well within the legal mainstream As for the man in his own words his explanations of his views and how he came by them seemed sometimes wise and witty sometimes legalistic and bloodless and sometimes in the view of critics a bit slippery Responding to a committee members suggestion that his frequent changes in political and legal philosophy going back to his socialism as a youth aroused concern about wheres the predictability in Judge Bork he began As Winston Churchill I think it was said Any man whos not a socialist before hes 40 has no heart and a man whos a socialist after hes 40 has no head  Critics termed legalistic and bloodless his approach to a 1965 Supreme Court decision that struck down a Connecticut law making it a crime even for married couples to use contraceptives More than once in discussions of Griswold v Connecticut with Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware chairman of the committee Judge Bork kept talking about inadequacies in the Courts constitutional argumentation Senator Biden invoking images of state control of the marital bedroom kept talking about inalienable rights rights that predated the Constitution And critics charged Judge Bork was being slippery when he said for the first time last week that he would reach virtually all of the same results the Court has reached in sex discrimination cases although through a different analysis With more than a week of committee testimony from supporters and opponents to go before the nomination moves to the floor prospects for confirmation remained very much up in the air ProBork lobbyists seemed a bit more confident than their adversaries who complained that their quarry had become a moving target by backing away from unpopular positions that had seemed at the core of his philosophy But senators in both camps praised him for answering questions directly thoroughly and goodnaturedly and for submitting to a far more searching and lengthy inquiry than any other nominee in history In the end a question laid out by Senator Arlen Specter remained I think the Pennsylvania Republican said that what so many of us are looking for is some assurance of where you are On Friday Judge Bork restated an answer he had given earlier in the week I have expressed my views here and those views are now widely known It really would be preposterous to say things I said to you and then get on the Court and do the opposite I would be disgraced in history
Ideology Has Everything to Do With Bork Choice,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/21/opinion/l-ideology-has-everything-to-do-with-bork-choice-292187.html,To the Editor As practicing lawyers we read with interest your OpEd articles Sept 11 on whether or not the ideology of Robert H Bork should be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee by Prof Louis Henkin pro and Prof Paul M Bator against Neither addressed the critical and we feel decisive issue which is generally ignored The Bork nomination is the culmination of the Administrations alarmingly successful sevenyear program to impress the ideology of the right wing of Reagan supporters upon the Federal judiciary The Administration does not seriously dispute that its nominees to the Federal bench must pass the tests of orthodoxy of the extreme right abortion busing affirmative action religion in the schools death sentence civil rights right to privacy and since Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has adopted it intention of the Founders There are five judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as brilliant and of an intellectual stature at least equal to their colleagues Antonin Scalia and Robert H Bork Each of the five had more judicial experience The names of none of the five were so much as mentioned for appointment to the Supreme Court solely because they did not possess the ideology demanded by the conservative orthodoxy Robert Bork was nominated for his ideology not his intellect The Senate and the people of the United States are entitled to know in detail what that ideology is before the vote on confirmation is taken We commend our professional society the Association of the Bar of the City of New York for recognizing this and for overwhelmingly opposing his confirmation after examining his judicial philosophy LEE HAZEN LEONARD M LAKE New York Sept 14 1987
How Bork Recast Ideas In His Senate Testimony,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/21/us/how-bork-recast-ideas-in-his-senate-testimony.html,One of the most remarkable aspects of Judge Robert H Borks five days of testimony last week was his recantation and qualification of some controversial views he has stated forcefully and repeatedly in the past as long ago as 1971 and as recently as this year Some of his most significant shifts were on free speech sex discrimination and more broadly the use by judges of the Constitutions vague guarantee of equal protection of the laws to strike down legislative acts He abandoned or muted his denunciations of major precedents dating to 1922 that have expanded individual rights while reaffirming his criticisms of others without using the provocative language he has used in the past He even softened somewhat his thunderous attacks on Supreme Court decisions recognizing rights to abortion and sexual privacy and other rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution But Judge Bork reaffirmed his basic positions that those precedents were wrong and gave no assurance he would not try to overrule them or others he has previously assailed The Discrimination Issue Judge Bork and his defenders indignantly denied charges of confirmation conversions The said his more recent shifts were not all that dramatic and were consistent with a long history of openmindedly changing positions as his views evolved They said his past positions had been taken out of context and distorted One striking contrast with Judge Borks previous position was his new view that the 14th Amendments guarantee of equal protection of the laws can be used to strike down laws that judges think unreasonably discriminate on basis of sex or that make unreasonable distinctions between other groups of people Over the past 16 years Judge Bork has repeatedly said as he put it in a 1971 article that the equal protection clause requires that government not discriminate along racial lines but much more than that cannot properly be read into the clause because the Court has no principled way of saying which nonracial inequalities are impermissible other than the personal beliefs of Justices He specifically criticized decisions including a 1942 precedent barring forced sterilization of certain groups of criminals and and discrimination against illegitimate children As the Court has used the clause to strike down various laws discriminating against women aliens and other groups Judge Bork has continued to assail both specific decisions and what in a 1982 speech to a conservative group he called the Courts radical expansion of the clause beyond the original intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment In an interview on June 10 he said equal protection should have been kept to things like race or ethnicity and that by striking down laws mandating different drinking ages for young men and women the Court tended to trivialize the Constitution and to spread it to areas it did not address Covering Selected Groups But in testimony Thursday Judge Bork said his primary objection had been to the Courts reasoning in using the equal protection clause to protect selected groups He said everybody is covered men women everybody by the clause Under his new approach of striking down laws that lack a reasonable basis for discrimination Judge Bork said for the first time that he would arrive at all of the same results I think  or virtually all of the same results  that a majority of the Supreme Court has arrived at At other points Judge Bork said he would strike down laws based on outmoded sexual stereotypes that society assumed to be reasonable when the equal protection clause was adopted but that no longer seem reasonable because the place of women in society has evolved Although Judge Bork denied that this position represented a major shift for him critics and undecided Seantors disagreed Some also questioned whether Judge Borks new position would provide as much protection for women and other nonracial minorities as his testimony seemed to suggest Free Speech Concerns Professor Laurence H Tribe of the Harvard Law School who has been advising Senate opponents of the nomination said in an interview The requirement of reasonableness as a solution to problems like gender discrimination and sterilization either could not serve to limit governmental power in the way hes suggesting because it has served as a virtual rubber stamp for government choices throughout the Courts history or it serves as an openended invitation to the kind of judicial imposition of the Courts own standards that Judge Bork seems to have been attacking throughout his career Judge Bork also backed away from some earlier criticisms of Supreme Court decisions broadly interpreting the First Amendments protection of free speech and embraced what he had called the Courts unjustified tenderness for subversive advocacy His general statement last week that his views have moved about to where the Supreme Court currently is on First Amendment issues contrasted with his denunciation in the 1982 speech of the Courts radical expansion of the First Amendment in the past 25 years Although Judge Bork had in 1984 publicly backed away from aspects of his argument in the 1971 article that the First Amendment protects only explicitly political speech his testimony last week contrasted sharply with positions he has publicly espoused from 1971 until quite recently Advocacy of Violence For example Judge Bork argued forcefully in the 1971 article that states should be able to prosecute and punish someone for any speech that advocates forcible overthrow of the government or the violation of any law Both in that article and in a speech in 1977 or 1978 he denounced as fundamentally wrong a major 1969 Supreme Court decision Brandenburg v Ohio that protects advocacy of civil disobedience or revolutionary violence unless it is likely to provoke imminent lawless action And in the June 10 broadcast interview Judge Bork said that the clear and present danger test from which the Brandenburg decision evolved was not an adequate test By contrast Judge Bork testified last week that he would protect some advocacy of civil disobedience and that the Supreme Court has come to the Brandenburg position which is okay it is a good position Importance of Precedent Judge Bork testified repeatedly that the speculative positions he had taken as a Yale law professor up to 1981 and in speeches both before and after he became a Federal appeals court judge in 1982 had little relevance to what he would do on the Court But in at least three taperecorded interviews in 1985 and 1986 he said that teaching is very much like being a judge and you approach the Constitution in the same way and that his views that the Supreme Court had usurped the powers of elected officials have remained about what they were as far back as 1971 A somewhat subtler change in emphasis between what Judge Bork said last week and things he has said before involved the importance of judicial precedent In his testimony Judge Bork emphasized that a judge must give great respect to precedent except in rare circumstances and should not overrule precedents that have become woven into the fabric of our system Previously he has also emphasized that certain deeply rooted precedents should not be rolled back The example he has often given has been the line of decisions upholding broad Federal Government power to regulate activities related to interstate commerce But Judge Borks past statements do not indicate nor did his testimony explicitly state that he would respect the dozens of decisions expanding individual rights that he has assailed as wrong and illegitimate In a 1985 questionandanswer session at Canisius College for example he said I dont think in the field of constitutional law precedent is all that important and added if you become convinced that a prior court has misread the Constitution I think its your duty to go back and correct it In his testimony Judge Bork said such an offthecuff response should not be taken as representative of his more considered views

Bork v. Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/opinion/bork-v-bork.html,The confirmation hearings on Robert Borks Supreme Court nomination did not end with his five arduous days of testimony last week but the focus has shifted  in part because his stated views have shifted When the hearings began the question was whether the Senate even had the right to explore his views Now it is which views  those he has expounded over many years in a long written record or his more moderate statements as a witness Has Judge Bork after a quartercentury of criticizing Supreme Court precedents now paddled into the mainstream of judicial thought The testimony of lawyers who know him and his record which began yesterday should help the Senate and the public find the answer To this point speaking for himself Judge Bork has been both prosecution and defense witness His written words attack landmark achievements of the Warren and Burger courts  and the Supreme Court under Chief Justices Taft Hughes Stone and Vinson More he has attacked the Courts entire method of fashioning and evolving constitutional doctrine These attacks support opponents who think he would roll back decades of gains for civil rights and civil liberties His spoken words under brilliant questioning by Senator Arlen Specter and others offset the written record Judge Bork now says he accepts settled First Amendment law that strong speech even speech some condemn as subversive cannot be punished unless it threatens imminent lawlessness His writings ridicule the extension of equal protection guarantees to women he now says he accepts the broader doctrines of Supreme Court moderates Judge Bork does not notably retreat from his position on abortion one the Reagan Administration admires He continues to deem the Courts 1973 ruling illegitimate And he continues to reject other courtconstrued constitutional liberties With the case of Judge Borks words v Judge Borks word now in the hands of other witnesses for and against his nomination theres special appeal to the openmindedness of uncommitted members of the Judiciary Committee like Senator Specter The stridency of Senator Edward Kennedy in opposition and the sycophancy of Senator Orrin Hatch in support thus yield to those who continue to listen to the evidence The public witnesses to be heard this week and next can help the Senate and the public weigh Judge Borks views and decide whether the spoken word redeems the written word As Burke Marshall a former Yale Law School colleague put it in opposing the nominee yesterday the question is not whether he would uphold the Constitution as he saw it but rather how he sees it
Tests of Fetuses Rise Sharply Amid Doubts,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/science/tests-of-fetuses-rise-sharply-amid-doubts.html,DOCTORS are increasingly offering pregnant women two prenatal tests that are so new that in some respects they are still experimental Uncertainties about the safety and accuracy of the tests mean that more than ever before pregnant women are being confronted with bewildering unfamiliar decisions But the tests designed to detect serious and common birth defects are providing what many women regard as welcome new opportunities to learn the condition of a fetus One procedure in which a sample of tissue is removed from the uterus can detect a variety of genetic defects including Downs syndrome as early as nine weeks into pregnancy But in some cases the test itself will result in miscarriage researchers still do not know exactly how dangerous it is compared with the longused procedure of amniocentesis which detects the same fetal problems The second procedure a blood test can indicate the possibility of nervous system defects and Downs syndrome the most common cause of mental retardation in this country In itself the test does not pose a danger to the fetus But its results are only suggestive and some critics worry that in followup tests the number of normal fetuses that are lost may be greater than the number of defective fetuses that are detected The use of both tests is growing explosively Federal experts say Theres been a real change in obstetricians attitudes in the past couple of years said Dr Joseph Schulman director of the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax Va a private fertility clinic More doctors he said see value in the new procedures As a result more women are facing increasingly difficult decisions about which prenatal tests to accept and how to act on their results Because the tests are so often a prelude to abortion they have heated an already simmering controversy But many obstetricians are offering them anyway in part because they feel the tests offer undeniable benefits and at least in the case of the blood test because they fear their legal liabilty if they do not offer the test In California physicians are required by law to offer the blood test to their patients about half the patients are agreeing The first test called chorionic villus sampling is offered at about 9 to 11 weeks of pregnancy Many experts believe it will eventually replace at least twothirds of the more familiar amniocentesis procedures which can only be done in about the fourth month of pregnancy when abortions are more difficult both physically and emotionally Amniocentesis involves cells obtained from the fluid surrounding the fetus in the amniotic sac The diluted cells must be grown in the laboratory before they can be analyzed so results are only available after about two weeks In chorionic villus sampling the cells are taken from hairlike projections or villi on the gestational sac that surrounds the fetus early in pregnancy The results are available within a few days With either test examination of the cells can disclose birth defects like Downs Syndrome TaySachs disease or others Competence of Labs Assessed The second test alphafetoprotein screening is a blood test that is mainly used to detect defects in the neural tube  which forms the spinal column and brain  the most common birth defects in this country It can also indicate when a fetus is at greater risk for Downs syndrome Dr James Haddow of the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough Me which assesses the competence of laboratories performing the test said his foundation is analyzing results from 130 labs now and that each lab does anywhere from 2000 to 60000 tests a year As for chorionic villus sampling the only data are from a registry maintained by Dr Laird Jackson of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia Dr Jacksons figures which understate the true figures are that 6544 procedures were reported in the United States last year and 11754 this year So far the test is most commonly offered to women in major urban areas The chorionic test was introduced in this country in 1983 but it was at first offered at only a handful of medical centers Initially physicians used a plastic catheter inserted through the cervix to obtain the samples The FDA regulated the catheter which it classed as a new device But today more and more obstetricians are using a needle inserted into the womans abdomen an unregulated technique Because the FDA cannot regulate procedures only drugs or devices it has been unable to limit use of the test Although more than 30 groups of medical researchers are offering the test as part of a Federal study that meets FDA guidelines many more physicians are offering it on their own Many of them believe the abdominal approach is safer than the transcervical procedure Dr Jackson suggested that the abdominal technique might offer less risk of hitting vital fetal structures causing miscarriages And Dr George Rhoads of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda Md said he believed that with the abdominal technique there was less of a chance of infection A major question has been the comparative safety for the fetus of the chorionic test and amniocentesis Amniocentesis performed at about the 16th week of pregnancy causes fetal death in about onehalf of 1 percent to 1 percent of cases according to the latest studies By contrast in more than 32000 chorionic tests over the past four years 19 percent have been followed by miscarriage Dr Jackson has found But he said this figure could not be compared with losses from amniocentesis because some of the women would have miscarried anyway Many obstetricians who offer the chorionic test simply tell their patients that the procedure has risks uncertain but not enormous We tell women that it is probably comparable in safety to amniocentesis although it is certainly not less dangerous Dr Jackson said Dr Rhoads and his colleagues are now conducting a study to determine how safe the chorionic test is About 7000 women at seven medical centers are participating  6000 have received the chorionic test and 1000 have received amniocentesis Within the next nine months the investigators hope to have enough data to determine whether the chorionic test is as safe as amniocentesis In the second test samples of the womans blood are taken to measure levels of alphafetoprotein a substance the fetus excretes into the amniotic fluid and that enters the mothers bloodstream The test was developed in England about 15 years ago but it was slow to be adopted in this country in part because a number of investigators and the FDA feared it would be offered without adequate counseling and followup services such as sonograms and amniocentesis if necessary But about two years ago the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warned physicians that they might be subject to suit if they did not offer a woman the test and she later had a child with a defect The test was developed to detect the serious birth defects that occur when the neural tube does not completely close during early development of the fetus In about half the cases the tube is open at the top and the baby is born with a rudimentary brain or no brain at all a condition called anencephaly These babies are dead at birth or die soon after In the other half of the cases the opening is along the spine and a portion of the nerve column of the spine is exposed These babies said to have spina bifida are paralyzed below the portion of open spine Some of these children also have hydrocephaly a condition in which fluid accumulates in the head and that can result in brain damage Children with spina bifida may be mentally retarded and frequently have no bowel or bladder control Neural tube defects occur in about 1 out of every 1000 babies born In nearly all cases there is nothing in a womans medical history or family background to hint that she might be carrying a baby with a neural tube defect The only way to find affected fetuses is with the protein screening When a fetus has a neural tube defect large amounts of alphafetoprotein pour out of the open spine or skull into the amniotic fluid From there they enter the mothers bloodstream where they can be detected The blood protein test is given at 16 weeks of pregnancy when there is enough of the protein around to make testing feasible Those women whose alphafetoprotein levels are abnormally high are given sonograms pictures of the fetus produced by sound waves to see if there is some other explanation for the finding If the sonogram reveals no explanation the woman is given amniocentesis The amniotic fluid is checked for alphafetoprotein and for acetylcholinesterase a nerve enzyme that is often present when the fetus has a neural tube defect In 1984 Dr Irwin R Merkatz of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx noticed that just as high levels of the fetal protein in a pregnant womans blood indicate that her fetus may have a neural tube defect so low levels may indicate that the fetus has a chromosomal defect the most common of which is Downs syndrome The finding was recently confirmed in a twoyear study Dr DiMaio and others throughout the country hail this result as an unexpected benefit of alphafetoprotein screening Until then woman were not normally offered amniocentesis unless they were at least 35 years old the age at which the risk of carrying a child with Downs syndrome  1 in 270  is about the same as the risk that the procedure will result in loss of the fetus But Dr DiMaio notes 80 percent of women who have babies with Downs syndrome are under 35 although their individual risks are low most pregnant women are younger than 35 With alphafetoprotein screening it is possible to tell younger women if the fetus they are carrying is at increased risk of having Downs syndrome and to offer them amniocentesis Not all cases of Downs syndrome will be detected by the blood protein test and most women who have amniocentesis on the basis of the test will not have fetuses with Downs syndrome but the chance that they will is seen as high enough to warrant the risk of amniocentesis Debate Over Blood Test Still the idea of offering blood protein tests to all pregnant women is far from universally accepted Dr Siegfried Pueschel of Rhode Island Hospital in Providence argues that Dr DiMaios study missed twothirds of the affected babies and that if the test were used on all women under 35 more normal babies would be killed from amniocentesis than the number of Downs syndrome babies that would be detected But Dr DiMaio and others take issue with this estimate because Dr Pueschel cites a fetal loss rate of 1 percent to 15 percent with amniocentesis whereas the usual estimate is onehalf of 1 percent Dr Pueschel replied that the loss rate depends on where the procedure is performed Dr Pueschel is also concerned that when a woman does have abnormal alphafetoprotein levels she may be sent to a genetic counselor who may suggest that the best thing to do is to have an abortion I have some problems with that Dr Pueschel said Parents should be educated and informed They should talk to the parents of a child with spina bifida or with Downs syndrome If you talk to parents you get a quite different opinion The National Down Syndrome Society takes no stand on prenatal testing The Spina Bifida Association supports responsible screening meaning they are not opposed to the test in principle according to Louise Schneiders of Walnut Creek Calif the groups secretary But Ms Schneiders said she is concerned that many women could choose to abort fetuses with neural tube defects because they have not been told the potential of a person with spina bifida The alphafetoprotein test does offer one possible benefit that could reduce the amniocentesis rate Women older than 35 with normal alphafetoprotein levels are at relatively low risk of having a fetus with Downs syndrome and so may elect not to have amniocentesis The screening test is not perfect Dr DiMaio said But it allows the detection of a birth defect that otherwise goes undetected Some critics have wanted to slow the introduction of the new tests But many doctors say there is never an ideal time to introduce new medical tests  there will always be nagging questions And for many women the benefits appear to outweigh the uncertainties these doctors say
"THE BORK HEARINGS; Packwood, Seeing Threat to Privacy, Opposes Bork",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/us/the-bork-hearings-packwood-seeing-threat-to-privacy-opposes-bork.html,Senator Bob Packwood saying he believed Judge Robert H Bork would do everything possible to overturn the Supreme Courts decisions on abortion and the right to privacy today became the first Senate Republican to oppose Judge Borks confirmation to the Supreme Court Mr Packwood a moderate from Oregon who is one of Congresss firmest supporters of abortion rights said he would take a leading role in the fight against confirmation He said he would aim his efforts at the 10 to 15 Republicans he estimated were open to persuasion Judge Borks views on abortion law and on privacy rights were a dominant theme of the questions put to the nominee by Judiciary Committee members last week and that concern was evident again today as the senators began hearing other witnesses Among them were black leaders like William T Coleman Jr the former Secretary of Transportation who said a Justice Bork would turn back the clock on civil rights Other witnesses however described the judge as a distinguished jurist who would be an ideal addition to the Court [ Article and excerpts from testimony page B6 ] Opposition Not a Surprise Because of his outspokenness on the abortion issue Senator Packwood had been counted by both sides as leaning strongly against the Bork confirmation so his announcement at a news conference today was not a surprise But his stand could have considerable influence not simply because he is opposing the nomination but because of the terms in which he framed his opposition Mr Packwood said that in two meetings with Judge Bork he had probed the nominee for assurances that the constitutional right to privacy and the Courts abortion rulings that are based on that right would not be in jeopardy if Judge Bork were confirmed The Senator a lawyer who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee said he had also scrutinized the judges testimony on these issues last week Having done that Senator Packwood said I am convinced that Judge Bork feels so strongly opposed to the right of privacy that he will do everything possible to cut and trim and eliminate if possible the liberties that the right of privacy protects No Explicit Mention In his testimony last week as in his earlier writings Judge Bork maintained his criticism of the Courts privacy decisions on the ground that the Constitution does not explicitly mention a right to privacy Pressed by several senators on whether he would go beyond academic criticism to an effort to overrule Roe v Wade the Courts leading abortion case Judge Bork did not answer directly He said he would take several factors into account including whether the lawyers seeking to uphold the decision could find a basis for abortion rights elsewhere in the Constitution Judge Borks supporters on the Judiciary Committee cited that response as evidence that the nominee would approach the question with an open mind Because he speaks with considerable authority on the privacy issues Mr Packwoods contrary conclusion makes it less likely that undecided senators can find reassurance in Judge Borks testimony Mask Is Off Testimony Senator Packwoods analysis takes the mask off Judge Borks testimony said Kate Michelman director of the National Abortion Rights Action League one of the organizations lobbying against the Bork confirmation It tells other senators dont be misled  she added We hope it will inform the other moderate Republicans and encourage them to stop and look at the record for themselves In July speaking to the abortionrights group Senator Packwood said of Judge Bork If I conclude that there is any possibility that he will overturn Roe vs Wade I will not only oppose him I will not only filibuster but I will lead a filibuster Today however while the Senator said he would participate in a filibuster he stopped short of saying he would lead a filibuster or conduct one singlehandedly if Democratic opponents decide against that strategy which could allow a minority of the Senate to prevent Judge Borks confirmation Senator Packwood said he had not yet talked to any other senators and could not predict the fate of the nomination But he said that by the time the full Senate is ready to vote there would not be more than one or two senators who are actually undecided
THE BORK HEARINGS; Poll Finds Public Opposition to Bork Is Growing,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/24/us/the-bork-hearings-poll-finds-public-opposition-to-bork-is-growing.html,A growing number of Americans are expressing an unfavorable opinion of Judge Robert H Bork after his weeklong testimony at Senate hearings on his nomination to the Supreme Court a New York TimesCBS News Poll shows The telephone survey conducted Sept 2122 indicated that Judge Bork was far better known as a result of his appearance on Capitol Hill last week but that his testimony had apparently done him some harm with the public Of the 836 adults surveyed 26 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Judge Bork 16 percent had a favorable opinion and 57 percent were undecided or had no opinion When the same question was asked Sept 910 before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began 12 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Judge Bork 11 percent had a favorable opinion and 77 percent were undecided or had no opinion Both TimesCBS News Polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points Reasons for Shift Unknown The poll did not look to determine why more people were responding unfavorably to Judge Bork But it seemed clear that it was an effect of the confirmation hearings last week in which the judge reaffirmed his opposition to Supreme Court decisions upholding abortion rights and personal privacy Democrats liberals blacks and women overwhelmingly opposed the nomination There was wide support for Judge Bork among conservatives and whites Men were about evenly split over whether he should be confirmed Opponents of Judge Bork have argued that the nomination should come under special scrutiny because he would be a swing vote on a variety of issues coming before the Supreme Court and that view seems to have taken hold among a growing number of respondents in the poll Nomination Viewed as Important Thirtytwo percent said Judge Borks nomination was more important than most other nominations to the court and 45 percent said the appointment was about as important In the poll earlier this month 22 percent said the nomination of Judge Bork was more important than most others and 51 percent said it was about as important In the new survey 27 percent of the respondents said Judge Bork should not be confirmed by the Senate 21 percent said he should be confirmed and 48 percent could not say In the earlier poll 13 percent said they opposed Judge Borks confirmation 14 percent supported it and 66 percent could not say The new poll demonstrated widespread support for the Senates handling of the confirmation hearings Fortyseven percent of the respondents said the Judiciary Committee had been fair in its treatment of Judge Bork 18 percent said it had been too hard on the nominee and nine percent said the panel had been too easy
WASHINGTON TALK: THE BORK HEARINGS; Both Sides' Witnesses: Calibrated Strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/25/us/washington-talk-the-bork-hearings-both-sides-witnesses-calibrated-strategy.html,To all but the most dedicated participants and observers the second week of hearings on Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court is passing in a bit of a blur The opening week in which Judge Bork fielded questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 30 hours over five days offered inherent drama After months of buildup senators and members of the public got their first chance to see in action the man portrayed by his supporters as an intellectual giant and by his opponents as a threat to civil liberties By contrast the second week with its parade of outside commentators alternating praise and criticism has lacked such a dramatic focus although it has offered something for everyone blacks lawenforcement officers historians former Attorneys General a famous novelist an equally famous painter historians and law professors a Democrat for Judge Bork a Republican against him In a way something for everyone is precisely the point of this second phase of the confirmation hearings which will continue Friday after a oneday break and then through next week as the end of the hearings approaches The daily witness lists are carefully calibrated mixtures designed by each side to convey particular messages to particular audiences Obvious and Not So Obvious Sometimes the strategy behind the choice of witness is obvious Warren E Burger the retired Chief Justice was invited by Judge Borks supporters essentially to be a character witness for the nominee a role also played on the opening day by former President Gerald R Ford who formally introduced Judge Bork These public figures the embodiment of the political and legal establishments were not there to discuss constitutional theory but to refute by their presence the charge that Judge Bork is so far to the right as to be outside the judicial mainstream Sometimes the strategy is not so obvious For example John P Frank a lawyer from Phoenix who testified Wednesday and offered a scathing detailed critique of Judge Borks judicial decisions is hardly a household name But he is very well known to two undecided members of the Judiciary Committee Senators Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania and Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona Mr Frank is a friend as well as constituent of Senator DeConcini and he was a teacher of Senator Specter years ago at Yale Law School Senator Specter continues to seek his advice on constitutional questions Although there was little chance that Mr Franks testimony would make headlines Judge Borks opponents regarded it as something of a coup It challenged assertions made by many Bork supporters that however unorthodox the nominees articles and speeches his work as a Federal appellate judge offers little basis for criticism Mr Frank called the nominee an activist judge who used the cases before him to advance his conservative agenda The witnesses in support of Judge Bork are selected in a collaborative process among White House and Justice Department officials and key Republican senators and their aides The opposition witnesses are chosen in consultations among Democratic senators their aides and the large coalition of organizations working against the nomination The process on both sides is cumbersome and lastminute changes in the daily witness lists have become routine Sometimes the audience in mind when a particular witness is invited to testify is an overlapping one Judge Borks opponents hoped that the testimony of William Styron the novelist and Robert Rauschenberg the painter both of whom said Judge Bork took a dangerously narrow view of the First Amendments protection of free expression would impress Senator DeConcini The Arizona Democrat is particularly interested in First Amendment issues and heads the Judiciary Committees subcommittee that deals with copyright protection But opponents also hoped that the artists comments would find a broader audience by making an abstract constitutional discussion come alive for cultural opinionmakers around the nation Still the primary targets of the witness lists remain the senators In addition to Senators Specter and DeConcini the undecided members of the committee are Senator Howell Heflin Democrat of Alabama and Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the Senate Democratic leader who rarely attends the sessions and has given few clues to his concerns Most estimates place the number of undecided or at least uncommitted members of the full Senate at 20 to 30 A key segment of the undecided group is made up of conservative Southern Democrats whose large black constituencies are strongly opposed to the nomination For that reason the opponents scheduled three black leaders as the leadoff witnesses William T Coleman a Republican lawyer who was a member of the Cabinet in the Ford Administration Barbara Jordan a former member of the House from Texas and Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta Central Themes Each side has basic themes to convey and to refute The central theme of the supporters is that Judge Bork is in the mainstream and as a corollary that the opposition is driven by special interest groups that are far out of the mainstream themselves The central theme of the opponents is that the nominees views are so extreme as to have alarmed not only the interest groups that have been conducting pubic campaigns but also a significant part of the legal establishment symbolized by 32 law school deans who signed a letter this week urging the Senate to reject the nomination Whether spokesmen for the civil rights civil liberties abortion rights and feminist organizations that have played a leading role in the antiBork effort will testify at the hearings has emerged as a delicate issue Spokesmen for these socalled special interest groups are not yet scheduled to testify and may not be depending on the outcome of a heated debate in the opposition camp that will probably not be resolved until early next week Quit While Ahead The matter is so delicate that few participants were willing to talk on the record Many opponents feel that the law professors and other outside witnesses have made their case effectively and that appearances by the organizational spokesmen would serve only to provide Republican senators with a platform for attacking the special interests But there are powerful institutional reasons for any leader of a national organization to want to make his or her case directly to a national audience Maybe we should quit while were ahead an official of one of the major organizations said But there is something very compelling about being there in the hearing record throughout history Kate Michelman director of the National Abortion Rights Action League put it this way If my points havent been made by someone else I want to testify If they have been then maybe it doesnt make sense Jerry Berman chief legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union said These are dozens of groups marching to many different drummers Its a hard issue We all have something to say
12 Priests Retain Views Despite Visit by the Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/26/us/12-priests-retain-views-despite-visit-by-the-pope.html,A week after Pope John Paul II ended his visit to the United States his pleas for a return to orthodox church teachings in many areas such as birth control and abortion appear to have had little impact at least according to interviews with a dozen Roman Catholic priests around the country On matters of personal morality liberal priests remained unconvinced conservatives remained adamant and those in between seem to have heard what they wanted to hear among the Popes four dozen homilies and addresses in his 10day tour of nine United States cities And while priests across the spectrum of thought did say they perceived a willingness in John Paul at least to listen to the debate over such issues as priestly celibacy and ordination of women others said the news medias focus on those questions had obscured the profound message in the Popes pronouncements on other subjects such as social justice But the Rev Matthew Didone of St Columba Church in Newark sees no room for confusion I firmly believe what I believed before in the positions of the Pope but with much more clarity he said The Pope has been very firm which has probably given a clear vision to many Catholics Earlier Survey of Priests The telephone interviews were conducted after the Popes departure with a dozen priests who participated in a New York TimesCBS News Poll just before the Popes arrival in the United States Sept 10 In that survey 55 percent of the 855 parish priests polled said they favored the right of priests to marry and 35 percent were opposed On ordaining women 43 percent were in favor and 43 percent were opposed The Popes visit it would appear from the interviews did not shift those positions And although their opinions varied on other issues in the interviews the priests remained united with the Pope in their opposition to abortion Discussing the impact of the Popes visit the Rev Bernard Gustas of St Josephs Church in Schenectady NY said I didnt change my mind about anything No married priests no women priests no abortion Homosexual activity  I dont go along with that All of the things he espoused I go along with On the other side the Rev James Voelker of St Josephs Church in East St Louis Ill said Celibacy  I think it should be optional Ordination of women  I would be for that With regards to birth control if people just want to have a good time I think they need to examine that But I also think that people who cant afford more children need an option other than abstinence But even on abortion where all other respondents were in firm support of the Popes position Father Voelker did not take an absolutist view Im against abortion he said However in some cases like rape incest you cant make a blanket statement In the middle the Rev Thomas Garthwaite of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Arcadia Wis agreed with most of the Popes positions But at the same time Father Garthwaite allows more room for choice I think he was just giving the traditional view Father Garthwaite said I dont think he was giving hard and fast rules about the future I would think he is open to change He has to give the teaching of the church you see But how the individual lives that is a matter of conscience The Rev Philip Conlon of St Marys Church in Marshall Wis said the church needed a program to clarify its positions With some priests going in one direction and others going in another direction he said lay people are left in a state of confusion But Father Conlon also left room for the possibility of change in church law Any church law can be changed by the stroke of the Popes pen he said Thats happened in the past Fish on Friday for example The underlying context of the papal visit according to the Rev Patrick Carroll of St Leos Church in Tacoma Wash was a struggle between hierarchy and democracy The Pope keeps saying were not a democratic church and the polls keep sounding like they want it to be Father Carroll said Not so for the Rev Vincent Sheehy of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Venice Fla This business of well take a poll to see how many people accept or reject a teaching is nonsense he said Morality is not determined by popular vote The Pope according to the Rev Norbert McCarthy of Queen of Peace Church in Millville Ohio is protecting society from itself It Bugs Me Father Carroll contended that the debate on dissent had detracted from greater issues It bugs me he said that the media seizes on the morality issues much more than they notice the things the Pope had to say on such things as social justice The Rev William Collins of Saints Peter and Paul Church in Rockford Ill concurred The Holy Father said so much about reaching out to all the cultural communities he said And it was encouraging to see that he at least listened to the concerns of the people the priests the bishops For the Rev Joseph Benintende of St Anthonys Church in Herkimer NY The Popes message was that its difficult to be a Catholic Its not a democratic church And its sometimes difficult to accept that But its the same as growing up as a child You still love your parents despite those hard moments
"LONG ISLAND OPINION; IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE, ON TRIAL FOR AIDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/nyregion/long-island-opinion-in-doctor-s-office-on-trial-for-aids.html,IT was a stateoftheart obstetricalgynecological office in an affluent North Shore community a 45minute drive from my home The medical complex sat across from the hospital where I would deliver my third child This clinic as my mother noted with pleasure while I parked my car was a far cry from the streetwise Bronx community clinic I had been compelled to use for my second pregnancy four years before At this practice all prescribed procedures from blood workups to sonograms were performed on site The flat examination table with stirrups had been rendered obsolete by a mechanical whiz chair controlled by foot pedals The waiting room was carefully colorcoordinated in soft comforting hues with parenting and baby magazines on tables It had been four years since I had last given birth and although I consider myself a reasonably intelligent woman I was under the impression that not much had changed about the birthing process I filled out the required insurance forms and had my blood pressure checked and my weight duly noted Then the nurse handed me some papers Just something wed like you to fill out she said blithely before leaving the room I quickly scanned what I first took to be a standard medical questionnaire Is there a history of mental retardation diabetes TB high blood pressure in your family I checked off No Simple enough until I read the next question which to the best of my recollection was Is your husbandmatepartner of black or Hispanic descent Have you had any spontaneous abortions or miscarriages Have you or your husbandmatepartner indulged in intravenous drug use within the past three years Subsequent questions continued this train of thought A following coda informed me that I could be voluntarily tested for AIDS at local health clinics I was also advised that women who wish to become pregnant should for their own best interest seek such testing Startled I glanced away Tacked on a cabinet door was a memorandum issued by some governmental agency It read in part that physicians are not required to personally take blood samples from suspected immunedeficiency patients I returned to the questionnaire somewhat shakily and perused the next to last statement If you have answered No to all of the above please sign here I did so The next question asked if I understood all of the above I answered Yes Are we finished the nurse asked relieving me of the barely inkdry papers She gave the papers a cursory look I was promptly ushered into the obstetricians office An hour later we were on our way home and I told my mother about the questionnaire She shrugged Its to be expected nowadays she said Yet it has haunted me like a snag in a pair of newly purchased nylons I could not quite afford and from speaking with friends acquaintances and neighbors I discover I am not the only one who is disturbed One woman brings her 6yearold daughter for a kindergarten dental checkup and she too must answer such redflag questions This mother also ascribes this as a sign of the times Others are not so sure But we all agree that that being under this medical microscope is dangerously disquieting for we are of the generation that did not abuse drink drugs or our bodies Yet we are still on trial I tell my husband of the questionnaire He is curiously unaffected he is smug in his innocence The public must be educated I am told I retort that I am so educated that if I see men or women with purple blotches on their skin I immediately ask myself Do they have it And I quicken my pace But this is different I am told Yet I am not told how Exactly what audience is being educated The one that should be Or is this someones idea of fulfilling the requirements of a publicservice announcement To be perfectly candid I could not afford to become a patient at this medical practice without the insurance my husbands employer provides In the antiseptic waiting room the other women around me were conspicuously white wellborn and well off I looked the same as they at least on the surface There were no black no Spanish no welfare mothers such as I had encountered in the Bronx clinic Were these women of lower social and economic background also being asked such questions And would they answer as truthfully as I had My internal questioning continued over several days What if I had answered Yes to any one of the questions What if I or my husband matepartner had been drug abusers What if my husband or I were black or Haitian What if in being what is currently considered a highrisk group I refused to have my blood screened for AIDS Would I still have been examined on the mechanical whiz chair Would I still have been given a supply of vitamins Would I still have been handed pamphlets on breast feeding and natural childbirth all embossed with the obstetrical groups name in gold Would I have been able to afford the 100 a visit until my insurance determines what it will pay Moreover what moral or social obligation was I under to be honest and where if such an obligation existed did it lie To the unsuspecting physician To the physicians climatecontrolled clientele Or to my child in securing for him or her the best care available to me Darker still what would occur if subsequent events proved I had lied on the questionnaire and developed AIDS Would I be held criminally liable But there is one question I ask myself one I am chagrined to discover I cannot or will not answer Would this particular obstetrician and the physicians colleagues agree to assist in the birth of my baby knowing I suffered from the deficiency disease And as a concerned patient what would my reaction be if I knew for certain that the kindly pregnant woman who sat next to me carried the AIDS virus in her body as well as her fetus It has only been four years but I suddenly feel very old
Catholic Bishops Seek To Halt Records Claim,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/us/catholic-bishops-seek-to-halt-records-claim.html,The nations Roman Catholic bishops are asking the Supreme Court to reject a private groups demand for church records in the groups legal challenge to the churchs tax exemption Catholic officials said Wednesday The New York case involves the efforts of the group Abortion Rights Mobilization to force the Government to revoke the churchs Federal tax exemption on the ground it engages in impermissible political activity  specifically in vigorously opposing abortion In its new appeal the bishops argued that Abortion Rights Mobilization was wrongly ruled to have legal standing to challenge the churchs tax exemption while the church was ruled to have no standing to challenge subpoenas for records That decision is worthy of review not only because it is wrong the appeal contended In addition it said such a decision also creates an opening for the disruption of the orderly administration of the tax laws and the harassment of religious and other exempt organizations by politically motivated opponents using the process of the Federal courts The case began more that six years ago when Abortion Rights Mobilization and others filed suit seeking to force the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the churchs tax exemption
Katharine Hepburn Takes the Movies' Measure,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/movies/katharine-hepburn-takes-the-movies-measure.html,EVER SINCE KATHARINE Hepburn won the first of her four Academy Awards for playing the role of a stagestruck tomboy in Morning Glory in 1933 she has wooed audiences with her unique blend of sass and class Unlike many other actresses who have faded from view she has taken on some of her most memorable and significant roles late in life  she won three Oscars after she turned 58 for her performances in Guess Whos Coming to Dinner The Lion in Winter and On Golden Pond Now still invincible as she approaches her 78th birthday she has just gone to Vancouver to make another film Guest Appearance a television comedy by James Prideaux about a crusty newspaperwoman who thinks she knows everything She also made her formal and longawaited debut this month as an author with the publication of The Making of The African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind Knopf a 129page memoir illustrated with 45 photographs that recreates her sojourn from the moment the producer Sam Spiegel called her and gave her the script The book stands 11th in todays Times Book Review list of nonfiction best sellers Ill never do the kind of book that people try to do on me  theyre all slightly cockeyed because they contain stories that just arent so Miss Hepburn said recently in her town house in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan where she has lived for more than 50 years But what a person has learned about life is interesting to me she said And what also interests me are films that were really disastrous or too successful or where something terribly funny happened And I decided to write about The African Queen because it was funny It was a fascinating story of how people juggle their own personalities and how they wind up she said And I thought it should be published alone because it would be such a really clever book With all the pictures of the movie its like a box of candies with all your favorites in it Over the years Miss Hepburn has attained the mystique of a culture hero because of her outspoken views on women and abortion her distaste for sham and convention and her fierce determination to be her own boss and protect the privacy of her 27year liaison with Spencer Tracy Even so she is first and foremost an actress who has made more than 40 feature films and five television movies and she has appeared in more than 30 stage productions ranging from musical comedies to Shakespearean dramas As a real veteran of the stage and screen she possesses a perspective on the industry that few performers can rival And today her views on film are informed by her characteristic feisty reverence for common sense integrity and good taste Films she laments are running amok because too many film makers confuse realism with the seamy aspects of life  they have lost sight of the heroic qualities and romantic vision that are also part and parcel of the human experience And they simply arent dramatic Its gone from storytelling to shock  or a series of shocks she said emphatically Some films are brilliant  such as Platoon  but some make no sense at all  theyre studies in pornography People have always bought papers and magazines which have been suspect But have we become so sexually desperate that we have to be beaten up It seems a kind of sadism and thrashing depravity of peoples private lives  and you just go mad she said her freckled hands poised gently in midair Because if sex reduces itself to fourletter words and visual stimulation that is sad because love and excitement are so far away from that What can life be if we see no beauty in it What magic is it that makes us like and trust and slave for someone I have found a lot more excitement and wonder and beauty in life than is now being handed to me in films Some of the things done today are funny  such as Tootsie or Annie Hall  she said but many are so vulgar What is thrilling to me is a beautiful sunset or seeing a deer run through the forest And what is thrilling to them They say look at my private parts Arent they interesting And I say no no Gee whiz are we that hard up for thrills I wont say what films I dont like but many have bored me because I dont like to see someone bleeding to death or getting kicked in the groin or the endless roll around one is forced to look at nowadays I know how people look when theyre naked or throwing up and I dont want to see it The great films of today she insists are those that explore human relationships without being vulgar or sensational I think the ability to present the simple truth is slightly absent today she said but when a picture comes along that has nothing to do with senseless violence or sexual suggestiveness such as A Room With a View it can do brilliantly because it will explore who we are and what were supposed to do and what is the most charming and acceptable longlasting relationship  On Golden Pond was successful because it was a really true story she said It was about a man who lived with his wife for many years and had a daughter who couldnt connect with him And it did business because its a topic that all of us are faced with and Ernest [ Thompson who won an Academy Award for the screenplay adapted from his Broadway play ] was able to say in a perfectly simple and honest way that this was funny  and it was funny and very endearing because we were able to laugh at ourselves and wind up in a hug  Guess Whos Coming to Dinner had the same kind of appeal because it was about something that was of enormous interest today and that is what are the blacks going to do with the whites and what are the whites going to do with the blacks What is correct It was about something that was true Confusion is boring to write about because it doesnt get on with anything  it doesnt say Here we are Lets improve But if I were a writer today I wouldnt know what to write about because no one knows anymore what is basic One reason Ive weathered the storm for as long as I have is because the topics I picked to do were interesting  and when youre older you can have a profound effect on people Even though Miss Hepburn has worked with a variety of leading directors ranging from George Cukor who directed her in many of her early comedies to Sidney Lumet John Huston Stanley Kramer and David Lean she dismisses the notion that the cinema is turning into a medium dominated by either directors or cinematographers Its the writing that counts she said Films and theater are still a writers medium  hes the one who gets the idea and does the work And if the writing is interesting and youre not an absolutely rotten actress you can make something of yourself in the film Spence had a great sense of the overall script but he wasnt interested in sitting around and discussing it I had a great interest in every detail because I always felt that the writing was of paramount importance and if the script is good its really hard to ruin it But I do think a director can help a script a lot she said  [ Gregory ] La Cava certainly twisted Stage Door around tremendously And George Cukor  who wasnt a good writer was a brilliant director because he had a wonderful way of presenting people  he gave me entrances and eccentricities and fixed it so that I looked at the camera with loving hands and he was a great deal of help  and Mark Rydell [ the director of On Golden Pond ] had the right sense of smell And theres no question in my mind that John Huston preferred shooting elephants to shooting The African Queen but he was an absolute genius  he knew exactly what to say to actors to get the right effect And I suppose a director can hurt a script a lot she said  The Madwoman of Chaillot was absolutely desperately awful because they changed the play considerably and everyone  including the director was deeply confused But a director cant destroy a good script  a director would have to be wildly inefficient to destroy Woman of the Year for example or any big hit Early in her career Miss Hepburn became known as a feminist because she wore pants when it wasnt the style she played tennis and golf she chose to have a career rather than raise a family and she spoke out for a womans right to vote and have an abortion Today she is equally outspoken about the confusion created by womens dual roles as mothers and workers which she feels is working against them in films and in life More opportunities for women in films she said aghast her voice rising in a slight crescendo My second director was a woman and I was brought up to feel as though women were just as good as men  it never occurred to me that I was an inferior sex I was a different sex But women have not benefited in stories she said because theyre writing about lunatic men or young men or sexually depraved men or gay men and women have become a kind of cheap sex object or a vulgar sex object or an impossible bossy object Theyre not writing anymore about great families when big big fascinating female stars used to dominate films Whos Garbo today she asked When I met her she was magic in your mind  a brilliant actress and fascinating and you didnt think what she was really like Whos Harlow Or Bette Davis Who are they Jane Fonda may have done very well with her overexercising but the new female stars are not as thrilling to me  theyre not romantic figures Theyre not stars anymore  in any field  and I have no idea why because people obviously long for them The actors and actresses today are still just as capable as they were years ago she says but theres too much selfabsorption Today they do a great deal of acting all in capitals she said Theres too much talk about it  and if I see the wheels going around in an actors head or if its too visibly worked upon its exhausting I dont think good directors tell you too much what to do I like acting to be a kind of a happening  Spence could just do it without a lot of talk and Larry [ Olivier ] could do the same thing she said Today the only actor of that size who has come along is Robert Lindsay He was magic [ in Me and My Girl ] absolutely magic But theyre only about four people Id put on that list  Laurette Taylor Spencer [ Tracy ] and Wilfrid Lawson a brilliant character actor in England The loss of the pioneering spirit that invested film making in its early years has also eroded its idealistic mission she declared Making films today still has the same conviviality Miss Hepburn said but there seems to be more concentration on money that were aware of Louis Mayer and Sam Goldwyn were remarkable creatures because they had a romantic appreciation of the business  they had a sense of love for movies And today its Whats the record How well did it do there  Its become a business Great big companies own companies and they put in money and they want to see results Are the times really out of joint Or is this simply a reminder that film makers need to do some reassessing about the mission and limits of their craft All good stories can be made she summed up I dont think people are limited in what they can do Film was and is still a romantic business just as life is romantic Your possibilities are romantic my possibilities are romantic  we have this enormous thing we can do with this thing called me
Assembly Panel Starts Looking At Surrogacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/nyregion/assembly-panel-starts-looking-at-surrogacy.html,LEAD CONNECTICUT would be one of the first states to regulate surrogate parents if State Representative Richard D Tulisano Democrat of Rocky Hill has his way CONNECTICUT would be one of the first states to regulate surrogate parents if State Representative Richard D Tulisano Democrat of Rocky Hill has his way Mr Tulisano cochairman of the General Assembly Judiciary Committee is heading a legislative panel that will study the issue between now the next legislative session The panel began work Monday with Mr Tulisano discussing the speakers he would like at a public hearing at the end of next month Please dont bring me people who say We want to have a baby  he told the group I dont have any children and I know how they feel What we want is people of national stature The panel its members said will need those types of witnesses if it is to help bring sense to the issue The Baby M case where a surrogate mother from Brick NJ was forced to relinquish her baby to the father is fresh in the minds of the panel members We have a real opportunity to be very deliberate and very comprehensive said Gail K Hamm of the states Permanent Commission on the Status of Women Ms Hamm will represent the agency on the panel but she said the commission had not arrived at a welldefined position on the issue The publicity surrounding the Baby M case and the very verbal support given to the mother by the National Organization for Women make it appear that women have made a decision about this issue Ms Hamm said Although womens rights groups have opposed the Baby M decision she said they are not uniformly against surrogacy Its an issue were struggling with she said A problem with banning surrogacy Ms Hamm said is that it would be intellectually inconsistent with legal arguments supporting the right of privacy If the state cannot interfere with a womans right to have an abortion Ms Hamm contended it should not be allowed to interfere with her right to give her baby away She added that state law already allowed private adoptions in Connecticut I have a hard time seeing how its different from surrogate mothers she said Mr Tulisano turned the argument around He cited adoption laws as an area where the state intervenes in a womans privacy We do say what women can do with the baby he argued Adoption is one area where the bonding between mother and child is taken into account by state regulations Mr Tulisano said and adoption laws allow mothers to change their minds once the child has been born Mr Tulisano introduced legislation at the last General Assembly session that would have strictly regulated surrogacy The bill would have prevented third parties from profiting from the arrangements and would have given custody of the children to the mother and her husband The Judiciary Committee saying the measure needed additional study did not act Ms Hamm said that even though she was not sure about her own position on the issue she wants to be sure Mr Tulisanos opposition is met with arguments from supporters of surrogacy I want to make sure that the other side is seen and the debate is kept honest she said One member of the panel has little trouble stating his position He is the executive director of the Connecticut Catholic Conference William J Wholeam Our policy is were against it totally he said Our feeling is youre kind of renting a womb Mr Wholeam said he was trying to keep an open mind on the subject He is checking with Roman Catholic organizations in other states to review the issue especially in Michigan where a bill to regulate surrogacy is before the Legislature But the Catholic Church is unlikely to shift its position What about the poor mother who carries the baby for nine months and who then has to give it up Mr Wholeam asked He also said liberalized abortion laws had reduced the number of babies available for adoption If it werent for abortion there would be more adoptions he said Even if the Catholic Churchs position is not adopted however there will still be moral issues The issue is very very complex another member of the panel State Representative Douglas C Mintz Democrat of Norwalk said It goes beyond the philosophical question of should you allow surrogate mothering What if the surrogate mother wants an abortion and who should be a surrogate mother were other questions he raised If we do allow it weve got to take the baby brokers out of it Mr Mintz said There shouldnt be a thirdparty profit motive there State Representative Edith G Prague Democrat of Columbia agreed We certainly dont want to make a business out of it she said Beyond that Mrs Prague said there should be regulations governing how surrogacy arrangements are made We do regulate artificial insemination she added We have laws regulating adoption At the very least she said the state should require prior counseling for all those involved in surrogacy Theres a lot that needs to go into surrogate parenting before parties are allowed to go ahead Mrs Prague said We dont want to just jump in and outlaw the whole thing Mr Tulisano said the panel agreed to halting payments to brokers The questions the panel will look at include the enforceability of surrogacy contracts the rights of the surrogate mother and the state regulations Beyond that he said is the question posed by advances in medicine that allow artificial insemination testtube babies and surrogate mothers Do we want the state Mr Tulisano asked to give its approval to all these strange new forms of procreation
MAKING A FEDERAL CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/books/making-a-federal-case.html,LEAD THE PROSECUTORS Inside the Offices of the Governments Most Powerful Lawyers By James B Stewart 378 pp New York Simon  Schuster 1995 THE PROSECUTORS Inside the Offices of the Governments Most Powerful Lawyers By James B Stewart 378 pp New York Simon  Schuster 1995   ALL successful criminal defense lawyers are egomaniacs prosecutors because of their power are potentially more dangerous Prosecutors decide who should be investigated granted immunity indicted brought to trial or offered a plea bargain And they usually do these things in secrecy often without supervision all within their discretion James B Stewart in his compelling new book The Prosecutors quotes Jacob Stein an experienced Washington defense lawyer as saying that prosecutors display all the affectations of temporary power    Many prosecutors are very young with narrow experience in life and the world Most have come from academic backgrounds and thats not a good qualification for a prosecutor    Most of them are inconsiderate  of other peoples schedules of the trepidation that others feel in approaching them Theyre overbearing lazy Every human defect is exaggerated by power Mr Stewart a senior writer for The Wall Street Journal and author of The Partners shows us a number of prosecutors who are better than those Jacob Stein had in mind  including Mr Stein himself after he was appointed special prosecutor to investigate allegations of impropriety against Edwin Meese Attorney General of the United States Through the recreation of seven fascinating complicated cases each with its own cast of characters Mr Stewart makes clear that the job of prosecutor can be fraught with ethical dilemmas frustration and a lot of hard work Each of the stories unfolds with the suspense of a terrific detective novel but the book is even better than that because the stories are true The cases involve charges of bribery of Pakistani officials by employees of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation industrial espionage by Hitachi Ltd employees discovered in a sting operation insider trading at Morgan Stanley  Company the murder of three CBS Inc employees tax fraud involving the Bank of Nova Scotia and the special prosecutors investigation of Mr Meese Mr Stewart excels in his ability to describe these cases with intelligence and clarity integrating complicated patterns of fact and convoluted laws making it all accessible to a general audience A lesser writer would have killed the readers interest with legalese or simplified the stories to the point of pulp Mr Stewart doesnt pretend to do an exhaustive survey of prosecutors Six of the seven cases presented involve Federal prosecutors when in fact the large majority of cases prosecuted in this country are in state courts In cases brought against large corporations  like those described in this book  the resources of the defendants can be much greater than those the Federal Government can summon But in the more typical criminal case  perhaps in more than 90 percent of all criminal cases  the prosecutor has resources vastly superior to those of defense counsel The defendant charged with the more common crimes usually is poor often represented by a harassed public defender who has never seen legal assistants paraprofessionals or a crack team of investigators and forensics experts Mr Stewart presents a few examples of the arrogance that can come with the power of the prosecutor Rudolph W Giuliani United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York is described as an ambitious publicity hound grabbing credit for what subordinates do undermining the authority of his staff firing people in gratuitously cruel ways a man engaged in a fierce competition for cases and attention with Robert Morgenthau the distinguished Manhattan District Attorney  MR STEWART ably demonstrates how prosecuting can provide a sense of power and control over events and people lacking in most jobs Although he doesnt dwell much on motives that may have brought prosecutors to their work he does say they spend their professional lives studying criminals whose exciting if reprehensible careers can sometimes exert a fatal attraction It is true that defendants and witnesses often describe their lives in lurid detail  passionate desperate lives filled with violence drugs and sex We learn that Mr Meese listened to police radio broadcasts for entertainment and even spent his honeymoon with his wife a probation officer on a tour of the California state prison system Mr Meese by focusing the energies of the Department of Justice on his personal obsessions with dirty books busing and abortion has almost paralyzed law enforcement of whitecollar crimes Mr Stewart concludes with a quote from Whitney North Seymour one of the most respected lawyers to serve as a United States Attorney Mr Seymour instructed his staff that to be a prosecutor requires commitment to absolute integrity and fair play to candor and fairness in dealing with adversaries and the courts to careful preparation not making any assumption or leaving anything to chance and to never proceeding in any case until convinced of the guilt of the accused or the correctness of ones position The Prosecutors demonstrates how tough it can be to meet these requirements in practice

Women's Fair Compensates For Loss of Vermont E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/us/women-s-fair-compensates-for-loss-of-vermont-era.html,Thousands of women and hundreds of men crammed the municipal auditorium here last weekend for workshops and exhibits crafts and music all by way of consolation for the voters defeat of a proposed state equal rights amendment It was the first Vermont Womens State Fair and the 170 exhibits were put on by such diverse groups as Vermont Right to Life ProChoice Vermont the League of Women Voters the American Civil Liberties Union the National Association of Women in Construction the Vermont Extension Homemakers Council Catholic Daughters and Jewish Women The idea for the event took root when Gov Madeleine M Kunin was thinking about the defeat last November of the state constitution amendment I felt the defeat of the ERA cast a pall over the status of women in Vermont said Governor Kunin who attended the fair with her 26yearold daughter Julia I felt we had to lift that pall and rejuvenate the spirit of Vermont women Founding Mothers Exhibit topics at the fair included discrimination sexual harassment abortion and health But there were touches of humor throughout The ACLU for example erected a lifesize drawing of a woman in colonial garb with a cutout face signing a document Tired of hearing about the Founding Fathers read a sign by the drawing For 1 fairgoers could place their face in the cutout and have their picture snapped signing the Constitution Kurt Hughes 28 of Bolton Vt stood near the photo booth where his wife worked It was such a disappointment when the ERA failed said Mr Hughes who said he would have attended the fair even if his wife had not been working there This seems like a great way to start fighting back

Politics in the Bork Battle; Opinion Polls and Campaign-Style Pressure May Change Supreme Court Confirmations,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/28/us/politics-bork-battle-opinion-polls-campaign-style-pressure-may-change-supreme.html,The battle raging over Judge Robert H Bork from the Senate caucus room to the television screens of America has thrust electoral politics and public opinion into the Supreme Court confirmation process more deeply than ever before With the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings entering their third week that process may have been permanently transformed especially if the Bork opponents who have seized the momentum in the last two weeks carry their string of tactical victories through to final triumph Were getting perilously close to electing a Supreme Court Justice Lloyd N Cutler a leading Washington lawyer who has been the most prominent Democrat so far to testify for Judge Bork said gravely in a hallway interview last week Certainly the process has many earmarks of an election campaign Millions of dollars are being spent on both sides of the battle in campaignstyle advertising and mailings charges of distortion are being traded thick and fast and television images are often overwhelming real issues Judge Bork himself has become the first nominee to testify in detail about his views on issues that come before the Court seeking to sway undecided senators with assurances about his positions assurances vaguely reminiscent of a politicians campaign promises Important Role for Voters The outcome still in the balance may hinge largely on the nominees appeal to the electorate as measured by poll results which in turn may depend more on simplistic images in advertisements and television news programs This could overshadow the sometimes profound but esoteric constitutional debates in the hearings Last week with considerable success the Democrats who control the judiciary committee carefully structured the scheduling of witnesses and gave selective emphasis to Judge Borks published views in an effort to dominate the news and appeal to undecided senators and the constituencies on which they depend Key senators have said they will be paying close attention to their constituents reactions in deciding how to vote The Committee Democrats with unexpected help from Republicans who pressed Judge Bork with repetitious questions kept antiBork witnesses with impeccable credentials in the spotlight pushing many of the best proBork witnesses into the evening hours Appearances Over Issues In such a contest public reactions to Judge Borks appearance and demeanor  his beard his naturally gruff voice his dignified but somewhat professorial display of stamina patience and intellect in the face of harangues by impassioned opponents may count for as much as his positions on such issues as when precedents should be overruled Mr Cutler and other Bork supporters suggested that this extreme politicization of the confirmation process could not only undermine the courts majesty as a bastion of principle above the political fray but set a precedent that might haunt the next Democratic President It might also they say impoverish American jurisprudence by preventing confirmation of bold probing thinkers who dare to question orthodoxy or to offend powerful interest groups There is some irony in the role Judge Borks opponents have played in fomenting the electionstyle political debate that concerns Mr Cutler It is the opponents after all who have most passionately stressed the need for the Supreme Court to be an independent bulwark of individual rights against majoritarian tyranny resisting the popular pressures to which elected officials are subject and who see the nominee as a threat to that role But Bork opponents reject suggestions that concerns about overly politicizing the confirmation process make it somehow inappropriate to oppose this nomination on ideological grounds Responsibility for the current political battle they say is widely diffused Reagan Effort to Alter Court President Reagan who has sought more systematically to alter the ideological balance of the Court than any President in 50 years chose a nominee known for his scathing denunciations of major Supreme Court decisions expanding civil rights and civil liberties as far back as 1922 Senate Democrats have reacted by waging the most openly ideological campaign in the recent history of Supreme Court nominations They say a lameduck President should not be able to use his appointment power to further a social agenda that he cannot get through Congress especially at a time when the Court is so closely balanced and many senators fear Judge Bork might move it in a dangerous direction And the Court itself has invited such political gutfighting over its role by thrusting itself for decades into the political arena with controversial decisions that rightly or wrongly struck down laws passed by elected representatives on issues like abortion and school prayer I would prefer less ideologically charged nominations and am confident that that would produce less charged confirmation hearings Paul Gewirtz a Yale law professor said Friday after testifying against Judge Bork Paralleling Popular Sentiment Without disputing Mr Cutlers point that the process of selecting Supreme Court justices should not become the functional equivalent of an election campaign Professor Gewirtz said Fundamental changes in the way the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution should not occur unless the country broadly accepts those changes as occurred in President Roosevelts time Bork opponents also stress that some of the same Republicans who now want the Senate to confirm Judge Bork led the openly ideological filibuster that blocked President Johnsons nomination of Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968 The Bork battle has taken one step farther down the political road than did the Fortas contest in that Judge Bork under pressure from undecided senators has found it necessary to expose himself in testimony to deep probing of his views Judge Bork himself also testified in response to a question that it was proper for the Senate to scrutinize his judicial philosophy The Bork supporters who had argued that ideology should play no part in the confirmation process seem to have lost that point Insofar as the Bork battle has become like an election campaign it has been marked by a series of early victories for opponents of the nomination to the point that White House officials said on Friday that Judge Borks chances were even at best Lobbying Gains and Losses Liberal groups who organized early and worked hard have produced a blizzard of memorandums and studies focusing attention on the nominees most controversial statements The counterpunches from proBork lobbyists were too little and too late to have as much effect The nature of the forum also presented Judge Bork with a problem in explaining some past positions that seemed out of tune with popular notions of justice His legal reasoning while resting on respectable grounds often lacked popular appeal It was also drained of much of its intellectual force by the time it had been compressed into news reports The strategic advantage that Democratic control of committee procedures gave to opponents was augmented by sometimes counterproductive efforts of Republican Senators to discredit witnesses who testified against him For example Orrin G Hatch of Utah Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire and others kept prominent and articulate antiBork witnesses on the stand for hours with sometimes fumbling crossexaminations ProBork witnesses some grumbling privately that the proBork senators were hurting their own cause waited deep into the twilight hours to testify The momentum could shift however when the nomination reaches the Senate floor especially if the demonstrated power of the White House to tip close confirmation battles with popular appeals and the dangling of carrots before key senators comes into play
Behind the Scenes: Democratic Strategist Who Turns a Phrase,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/28/us/behind-the-scenes-democratic-strategist-who-turns-a-phrase.html,In 1952 when Ann F Lewis was 14 years old she wore a black armband to school to mourn Adlai Stevensons defeat in the Presidential election She told me later that one of her friends said Ann youre weird  recalled Ms Lewiss brother Representative Barney Frank a Democrat from Massachussetts Thirtyfive years later Ms Lewis has become one of the Democratic Partys most prominent strategists and along the way one of the most quoted political figures in Washington She is now advising the Rev Jesse Jackson in his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination and at the same time helping coordinate the effort to block the confirmation of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court Ms Lewis is widely recognized as a skillful political tactician and her ability to turn a phrase into a newspaper quote wins praise even from her critics But some members of her party find something in common with that longago classmate when they assess her politics Fundamental Debate Some say her prominence is out of proportion to her position in the Democratic Party while others say the same kind of defiant loyalty that made her mourn Mr Stevensons defeat has put her out of step with the mainstream of the party If Ann were to run for chairman of the Democratic Party Id vote against her said Robert S Strauss a former party chairman She represents a point of view that the Democratic Party must get away from Ms Lewis disputes that image and says her philosophy is not nearly as radical as some of her adversaries believe But she does symbolize a fundamental debate between those like her who defend the partys links to special interest groups and those who believe the Democrats have been hurt by their allegiance to such organizations Ms Lewis born in 1938 the second child in a Hudson County NJ family dates her first political memory to when she was six years old It was the night of the 1944 Presidential election I wanted to listen to the radio but my parents said Its OK go to bed Roosevelt will win  she recalled in an interview in her Georgetown office Well I went to bed and Roosevelt won My picture of politics was as something terribly important but the good guys always won Then came 1952 and I found out we didnt always win Got Married and Had Children Ms Lewis studied at Radcliffe but dropped out after a year and a half to follow her husband Gerald to an Army assignment at Fort Benning Ga Im a child of the 50s she said You were supposed to get married and have children so I got married and had children She moved with her husband to Miami after he left the Army and graduated from law school And she became involved in politics there when her husband mounted a successful campaign for a seat in the state Legislature By 1968 they were separated and Ms Lewis moved with her three daughters to Boston where her brother Mr Frank was working for Mayor Kevin White Ms Lewis joined the Mayors staff and worked for him until 1975 when she began working for Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana In between she managed Barbara A Mikulskis unsuccessful campaign against Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr of Maryland in 1974 and she participated in the founding meeting of the National Womens Politial Caucus in Houston in 1971 We met there in a hotel where they refused to page women because that sort of thing was usually associated with ladies of the night said Ms Mikulski now a Senator from Maryland Broader Political Goals Ms Lewis who was an administrative aide for Ms Mikulski and for Representative Stan Lundine of upstate New York before he became the Lieutenant Governor quickly became an effective spokeswoman for the womens movement Her experiences gave her a solid grounding as an organizer for liberal causes but Ms Lewis had broader political goals I learned very quickly that you can either be part of the people who make the rules or you can sit back and live by the rules that other people make she said In 1981 she became political director of the Democratic National Committee a post she held until after the 1984 elections when she became director of the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action She left that group in July What I like to do is empower people use the dynamics of the political system to make them stronger and more effective Ms Lewis said Because I have been on the inside I can talk to issueoriented people about the best way to get their issues across Rapid Political Analysis Ms Lewis has drawn praise recently for her work for Mr Jacksons campaign Ann has played a substantial role in moving Jesse Jackson toward a nonconfrontational theme said a Democratic official who asked not to be named This time around Jesse Jacksons not beating up on the party or its rules as he did in 84 James Zogby executive director of the ArabAmerican Institute and an adviser to Mr Jackson said the addition of Ms Lewis to the campaign advisory team was part of a conscious effort to broaden the candidates appeal It is her ability with words combined with her rapid political analysis that has made Ms Lewis a favorite of political reporters and has led to her being a frequent guest on programs like the McNeilLehrer News Hour on PBS and Nightline on ABC She is quoted regularly in The New York Times The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times Typical of the wellturned phrases that have led to her being quoted more than 40 times in The New York Times in the last 18 months was her description of efforts by Presidential candidates in 1984 to court the feminist vote It was a little bit like a freshman mixer she said We were all dressed up but we were a little nervous about meeting each other While that kind of line wins praise some Democrats find Ms Lewis too strident and too far to the left A party official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the conventional wisdom was that Ms Lewis represented Democrats who would give too much influence to feminists groups that support a womans right to abortion and opponents of the Administrations policy in Central America Its quite remarkable that somebody who represents a fringe of the party is viewed as a spokesman on Democratic issues all the time said Al Fromm director of the Democratic Leadership Council a group of moderate to conservative politicians Ms Lewis sees the issues differently I do believe it is a function of the party structure to reach out to issueoriented allies she said Blaming interest groups for our failures is a little like blaming the stagehands when you dont like the play I do not mean that we ought to be spending all of our time during campaigns talking only to our friends she said Neither do I think that we should spend all of our time between campaigns beating up on our friends
"WASHINGTON TALK: CAPITOL HILL; For Proxmire, the Fleece Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/28/us/washington-talk-capitol-hill-for-proxmire-the-fleece-goes-on.html,On the opening of every Senate legislative day since 1967 Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin has risen to begin the session with a 600word address On Friday Sept 11 the ritual was no different but the message he delivered was something of a stunner Mr Proxmire the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said he was considering pushing for repeal of the GlassSteagall Act a landmark piece of New Deal legislation that through strict regulation sought to wipe out corrupt selfdealing in the financial system by separating banking from the brokerage business This Senator has not decided whether or not it is in the national interest to take this step he said in his speech but there is a strong case for its outright repeal Highly Independent Ways With those words Mr Proxmire known for his highly independent ways put his colleagues on notice that he was contemplating one last legislative coup before he leaves politics when his term expires next year For more than half a century GlassSteagall has stood as a bastion of prudent regulation inspired by the Democratic Party And now a son of that party was contemplating the laws demise an outcome greatly desired by big city bankers Last week he said he would definitely introduce a bill to repeal the law The stance might be out of character for most Democratic senators But from his earliest days in the Senate Mr Proxmire has marched to his own beat at times alienating his fellow Democrats yet earning their respect for his integrity and intellect No one knows the issues like Proxmire said Senator Christopher J Dodd Democrat from Connecticut Probably no other Senator runs his finances or his campaign like the 71yearold Democrat who announced last month that he had decided to leave politics before his health and mental powers began to deterioriate Not only does Mr Proxmire refuse to accept contributions from political action committees but since 1974 he has not taken any campaign contributions at all Instead he finances his campaigns out of his own pocket In his 1976 reelection he says he spent a total of 17775 getting my nomination papers printed buying stationery and sending back contributions And in 1982 he cut that to 14510 In his view the power of incumbency is enough for most legislators I think fully twothirds of the senators could get reelected without spending a penny he said Mr Proxmire appears to revel in not being beholden to any special interest group  the obvious result of refusing all PAC contributions Its such a terrific feeling not to have your hand out he said not to feel that youve got to give access to your office just because someone contributed 5000 bucks As a result he observes with some amusement he gets lobbied very little But if anything has characterized the Proxmire years it has been the attention to frugality In addition to keeping his own spending on a tight leash he has been a fanatical opponent of excessive Government procurement programs particularly military procurement programs He votes against most appropriations bills especially if they involve the Strategic Defense Initiative which he calls a terrible waste And he continues to announce every month his Golden Fleece award to the Government agency that best exemplifies wasteful spending But Mr Proxmire has supported a number of Reagan Administration issues He voted 45 times for example against Federal financing for abortion which he calls the destruction of human life He also says that he might support the Administrations nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court although he is concerned about some of the judges positions I think very highly of Borks personality and intellect and I have often voted for people like him in the past even though I did not agree with them Mr Proxmire said However I think Judge Bork is dead wrong on civil liberties civil rights and antitrust  some of the proudest accomplishments of the Congress And I would not want to see his vote begin to reverse this progress Not a Lame Duck Although he has announced his departure for next year Mr Proxmire does not buy the line that he will be weakened in his chances to push through an aggressive legislative agenda He wants the Senate to consider a bill that would place new restrictions on hostile corporate takeovers And he says that if not push for outright repeal of GlassSteagall at the least he will try to give the banks new securities powers by next spring Its not like a Presient ending his term and getting a lameduck status he said of his leaving If anything you have a little more credibility with your colleagues because they figure youre not just doing it to be reelected You also do not pose as much of a threat to the other party so they are more willing to treat you on a nonpartisan basis Senator Phil Gramm a Republican from Texas agreed Give me a Proxmire anytime over the goalong getalong kind of guys he said I think well want to give Proxmire one last fleece
California Enacts Law On Abortion for Minors,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/29/us/california-enacts-law-on-abortion-for-minors.html,Most minors will need permission from a parent or court to get an abortion under a new California law versions of which have already been struck down as unconstitutional in other states Gov George Deukmejian announced Sunday that he had signed the hotly debated bill The law will require an unemancipated minor typically an unmarried girl under the age of 18 years to get permission from a parent guardian or court to obtain an abortion The restrictions will not apply when there is a medical emergency Opponents however vowed to fight the bill in court and said the Legislatures defeat of a companion measure that would have appropriated 15 million to cover the cost of anticipated hearings in juvenile court helped their cause Earlier this month a similar law in Minnesota was struck down as unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court while a Federal district judge barred Georgia from enforcing its parental consent law until the Supreme Court ruled on an Illinois law possibly this fall The Supreme Court in 1981 allowed states to impose the parental notification requirement for girls under 18 who are still dependent on their parents But in 1983 the court struck down an abortion laws 24hour waiting period that applied to minors and adults alike
Judge Rejects Lawsuit Over Abortion Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/01/nyregion/judge-rejects-lawsuit-over-abortion-policy.html,A Federal judge in Manhattan dismissed a lawsuit yesterday that challenged President Reagans policy of denying aid to foreign organizations that promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries The suit which questioned the constitutionality of the policy was dismissed by Judge John M Walker Jr in Federal District Court He said the suit sought the annulment of Presidential foreign policy which is beyond the competence of the court The Planned Parenthood Federation of America and others filed the suit last January against the Agency for International Development which provides foreign aid including money for family planning
Survey of Electorate Finds Weak Political Parties and Conflicts Over Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/01/us/survey-of-electorate-finds-weak-political-parties-and-conflicts-over-change.html,The political coalition assembled by President Reagan could easily crumble at the end of his term but the Democratic coalition is at least as precarious and the party is handicapped by doubts among its own supporters about its ability to manage the Government a major new study of the electorate says The study conducted by the Gallup Organization for the Times Mirror Company also indicates that Democrats could still mobilize a large share of the electorate around the theme of social justice and in favor of specific programs But it found a deep reservoir of popular skepticism about the Federal Government which could continue to help Republican candidates hewing to an antiWashington theme More disturbing for the Democratic field of six relatively unknown Presidential candidates is the surveys finding that by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 Americans would prefer a candidate with experience in Washington to one from outside who could change the way things are now being done Gorbachev Is Popular While three of the Democratic candidates are members of Congress the two Presidential hopefuls with the greatest claim to extensive Washington experience are Republicans Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole One striking finding is the remarkable personal popularity of the Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev Although those surveyed expressed deep hostility to communism Mr Gorbachev himself was viewed favorably by 41 percent of those surveyed and unfavorably by 38 percent The researchers noted that Americans viewed Mr Gorbachev more favorably than they did Wall Street investors the CIA Richard M Nixon and the Rev Jerry Falwell The study based on long interviews with 4244 Americans from April 25 to May 10 offers a remarkably detailed portrait of the political attitudes of the American people by employing a method of categorizing the electorate more precisely than the conventional party or ideological labels allow In order to trace any change in attitudes since last spirng Gallup reinterviewed 1903 of the original respondents in late September Ambivalence on Social Change The survey for Times Mirror which owns The Los Angeles Times Newsday and other newspapers and broadcast stations is part of the news conglomerates series The People Press and Politics an intensive set of studies of public opinion The study portrays an electorate closely divided on many key issues and it suggests that Americans are deeply ambivalent and divided within themselves about many of the social changes of the last two decades For example 68 percent of those surveyed said that too many children are being raised in day care centers today But 66 percent rejected the idea that women should return to their traditional role in society Over all 87 percent of those surveyed said they had oldfashioned values about family and marriage The survey which has a margin of sampling error of two percentage points finds a similar ambivalence on racial matters Seventytwo percent rejected the statement I dont have much in common with people of other races but only 48 percent approved of interracial dating Coalitions Seen as Unstable The report builds on the earlier work of other analysts in arguing that conventional political labels like conservative and liberal even Democrat and Republican are of little use in describing the American electorate Rather than simply relying on peoples descriptions of themselves by party and ideology the survey asked 72 questions on a broad range of topics including politics religion moral attitudes foreign policy and tolerance of dissent Using the mathematical technique of factor analysis the researchers derived statistical factors from these responses that sorted Americans into 11 distinct and relatively coherent groups The researchers then analyzed these groups to find what characteristics seemed to hold them together and applied labels ranging from enterprisers and moralists to upbeats and disaffecteds Over all the survey found both the Republican and Democratic coalitions to be highly unstable amalgams that cut across age and class lines and fundamental religious and moral questions DeadEven Standoff Both parties have opportunities both parties have advantages both parties have headaches said Norman J Ornstein a consultant on the study in summarizing the findings Andrew Kohut president of the Gallup Organization said the study showed the two parties in a deadeven standoff going into the 1988 campaign The core supporters of the Republican Party  21 percent of the whole electorate  were divided almost in half between groups Gallup labeled enterprisers and moralists The enterprisers are classic Republicans welloff well educated probusiness and skeptical of government tough on foreign policy but relatively liberal on moral and religious questions The other half of the Republican coalition is hardline on foreign policy and intensely conservative on moral questions strongly opposed to abortion and in favor of school prayer This moralist group is middleaged middleincome and includes a heavy concentration of Southerners Contradictions in All Groups This group is more sympathetic to Federal help for the needy than the enterprise Republicans But in this group and others the survey found that lowerincome whites were still skeptical of government programs aimed at helping black people If these two Republican groups are in contradiction on many issues so too are two equalsized groups of political independents making up 16 percent of the electorate who Mr Reagan added to his electoral alliance One of these groups labeled upbeats in the study consists of young optimistic socially tolerant voters Mr Reagan won 86 percent of the upbeat votes but he did nearly as well within a group that is the polar opposite the disaffecteds These voters the study says are alienated pessimistic skeptical of both big government and big business The Democrats alliance is equally precarious younger welleducated liberals labeled 60s Democrats older mainly bluecollar voters labeled New Dealers and two groups of poor people one more politically active than the other Together the four groups make up 35 percent of the population and 41 percent of those likely to vote Seculars and 60s Democrats Among the independent voters Democrats have also received considerable support from a group the study labeled seculars who are similar to 60s Democrats in most respects but are characterized mainly by a lack of any professed religious belief The study discerns two other groups whose impact on electoral politics is minimal bystanders with absolutely no political interest and followers who lean toward the Democrats but have few strong political convictions and are heavily influenced by political commercials Together these groups make up 18 percent of the population but only 4 percent of the electorate The survey suggests that each party has an opportunity to draw on powerful undercurrents of opinion to move voters in their direction For the Democrats these include deeply rooted support for social equality and opposition to big business and concentrations of wealth The study suggested that an appeal on social justice issues could appeal to virually all 11 groups with the exception of the strong procapitalist enterprisers For example the survey found overwhelming support for Government intervention on behalf of the needy  71 percent said the government should take care of people who cant take care of themselves and 62 percent said that the Government should guarantee every citizen enough to eat and a place to sleep Doubts Among Democrats A powerful undercurrent against business is evidenced by the 77 percent who agreed that too much power is concentrated in the hands of big business companies and the 65 percent who agreed with the statement business corporations make too much profit While respondents are far more likely to see the Democrats as concerned about the disadvantaged they rate the parties about equal in their ability to to select good candidates and manage the Government And the survey found that certain key Democratic groups particularly the affluent and well educated have doubts about Democratic candidates and the partys managerial skill But the Gallup researchers came to a conclusion similar to those of more than three decades of survey research that the American belief in equality is also balanced by faith in individual achievement For example while 77 percent of those surveyed agreed that its really true that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer only 29 percent agreed with the statement that hard work offers little chance of success and only 38 percent agreed that success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control And if Americans are critical of business they also see it as essential to the nations prosperity Seventysix percent of those polled for example agreed with the statement The strength of this country today is mostly based on the success of American business Fifty five percent agreed that Government regulation of business does more harm than good and 63 percent agreed that when something is run by the Government it is usually inefficient and wasteful Such attitudes are likely to be helpful to Republicans and so could three overwhelming sentiments the survey unearthed the intense patriotism of the American people their deep devotion to religious faith and their visceral opposition to Communism A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE ELECTORATE A poll by the Gallup Organization for Times Mirror asked 72 questions about political personal and moral issues Using a statistical analysis of the responses researchers classified Americans into these 11 groups

Democracy Doesn't Need Bork's Protection; Not End of Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/opinion/l-democracy-doesn-t-need-bork-s-protection-not-end-of-abortions-640087.html,To the Editor Few arguments are so blatant and disturbing as those regarding the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court I would address just one the suggestion that if Robert Bork is elevated to the Court legal abortions will no longer be permitted in the United States For those who have read and digested the lengthy and tangled opinion in Roe v Wade it is little surprise that Judge Bork should object to it on theoretical grounds It is one of the most egregious examples of judicial sophistry in modern jurisprudence His view of the decision simply stated is that the alleged right to privacy a right the country survived without until it was discovered by the Court in Griswold v Connecticut in 1965 from which the right to abortion springs was created from whole cloth without constitutional foundation Such a view is not shocking to those who are candid about the letter and the spirit of the Constitution The fallacy however is that if Roe v Wade is overruled  not a foregone conclusion  there would be an abrupt end to the practice of abortion in the United States On the contrary overruling Roe v Wade would force the issue back to the states where it properly belongs For those few states that do not have state constitutional provisions for a right of privacy and thereby perhaps a right to abortion a legislative enactment could easily achieve the same result Thus even if Roe v Wade is overruled because of Judge Borks elevation it is by no means certain that the practice of abortion will cease in this country or that individual privacy will be impaired What is certain is that the issue of abortion will be the subject of open and serious legislative debate and will be resolved by people who are directly accountable for their actions MATTHEW B LEHR New York Sept 15 1987
Senate Votes to Let Insurerss in Capital Reject AIDS Clients,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/us/senate-votes-to-let-insurerss-in-capital-reject-aids-clients.html,The Senate voted Wednesday to allow insurance companies to deny insurance to people in the District of Columbia who test positive for exposure to the AIDS virus In approving the citys 3 billion budget for the fiscal year 1988 the Senate by a 55to44 vote refused to kill an amendment on the subject offered by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina The amendment says the city cannot use money in the budget after Dec 31 if the City Council does not repealed a local law prohibiting such denial of insurance The Senate then approved the amendment on voice vote The measure needs approval of the House to take effect Similar amendments attached to two different Senate bills last year at Mr Helmss request were removed by HouseSenate conferees The District law that took effect in August 1986 does not make its protection applicable to people who actually have acquired immune deficiency syndrome But it prohibits companies from denying health or life insurance to people who test positive for exposure to the deadly virus In setting rates companies also cannot use a persons marital state or sexual orientation to predict if an individual may develop AIDS in the future Mr Helms said the law discriminated against people who had to pay higher premiums because of ailments other than AIDS and had caused insurance companies to refuse to insure city residents because of high costs Congress has a right and a duty to overturn this absurd law Mr Helms said But Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut said that while the law might not be perfect it was wrong for the Senate to interfere in a local issue Senator Tom Harkin Democrat of Iowa said the amendment would set a dangerous precedent on whether the Federal Government should control local insurance In approving the budget the Senate also rejected 60 to 39 an amendment offered by Senator Don Nickles Republican of Oklahoma that would have barred the city from using tax funds to pay for abortions except if the womans life was in danger Instead the Senate used the language included each year since 1980 and voted to prohibit the city from using Federal funds to pay for abortion unless the mothers life is in danger or in case of rape or incest Differences in the House and Senate versions of the city budget will be adjusted in conference and the spending plan will again face votes in both houses In the meantime the city will continue to operate under this years spending bill The Reagan Administration has threatened to veto the citys budget if the abortion language is not toughened
A.C.L.U. TO ACCEPT P.L.O. SPEECH CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/03/us/aclu-to-accept-plo-speech-case.html,The American Civil Liberties Union anticipating intense and widespread opposition among its supporters has decided to defend the right of an agent of the Palestine Liberation Organization to run an information office here Were working on the details now Ira Glasser executive director of the ACLU said of the decision which has not been officially announced But we are going to represent him We see this as clearly a free speech issue On Sept 16 the State Department notified Hassan Abdul Rahman a United States citizen who heads the Palestine Information Office in Washington that his status had been changed from foreign agent to head of a foreign mission The State Department then sent Mr Rahman a second letter ordering the mission closed by Oct 15 That move was interpreted by many as a maneuver aimed at heading off even stronger Congressional action Bills introduced in the House by Representative Jack F Kemp Republican of upstate New York and Representative Daniel A Mica Democrat of Florida and in the Senate by Senator Charles R Grassley Republican of Iowa and Senator Frank R Lautenberg Democrat of New Jersey would shut not only the PLOfinanced information office in Washington but also the PLO mission to the United Nations in New York Spectrum of Support for Bills The bills have attracted several dozen cosponsors ranging from Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina on the right to Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts on the left Im afraid even the good guys on civil liberties are going to be against us on this one said Mr Glasser He noted that the ACLU had provoked bipartisan political outrage in the past such as when it represented American Nazis demanding the right to march in Skokie Ill in 1977 and when it has defended Ku Klux Klan members seeking to demonstrate in black neighborhoods The common denominator in all these cases Mr Glasser said is that they fall under the umbrella of the First Amendment He contended that both the State Departments action and the pending legislation violated Mr Rahmans constitutional right of free expression Rahman is legally registered as an agent of the PLO under the Foreign Agent Registration Act Mr Glasser said Hes a United States citizen who is not accused of having violated any laws Basically hes just running an information booth Precedent for Restriction Seen Mr Glasser added that the silencing of an American who spoke on behalf of the PLO would set a precedent for restricting others advocating the causes of groups accused of terrorism including rebels in Nicaragua guerrillas fighting the Russians in Afghanistan and antiabortion activists linked to individuals who have bombed abortion clinics There is an important distinction between advocacy and conduct and that distinction must be maintained Mr Glasser said Rebutting that view Mr Kemp a candidate for his partys Presidential nomination argued that neither the State Department action nor the House and Senate bills would stop anyone from saying anything As a private citizen Mr Kemp said Mr Rahman has the right to espouse any policy or ideology he chooses What the bill aims to prevent the legislator added is the embedding of a terrorist organization like the PLO in our midst as an official presence and the receiving of funds by an American from an organization engaged in terrorism He can be the PLOs advocate but not its agent Mr Kemp said Kemp Explains Position Mr Kemp said he had introduced the legislation because the PLO had specifically selected Americans as its victims and in the belief that the Government was responsible for protecting Americans from terrorism He said he welcomed the State Departments action but did not intend to withdraw his bill in response Ben Justesen a State Department spokesman said that the order to close the Palestine Information Office had been taken legally He declined to comment on the decisions constitutionality Mr Glasser said that Mr Rahman had never personally advocated the use of violence or terror but that even if he had for us that would be irrelevant adding Were defending the rights of free expression guaranteed by the First Amendment not the content of the views expressed Mr Glasser predicted that the issue will most likely end up in litigation
The Bork Battle: Visions of the Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/04/weekinreview/the-bork-battle-visions-of-the-constitution.html,ON the eve of Judge Robert H Borks confirmation hearings the question was whether the liberal opposition had a realistic chance of defeating the distinguished Supreme Court nominee Three weeks later as the Senate Judiciary Committee finished its inquiry and prepared for a vote this Tuesday the question became whether the Reagan Administration could salvage the nomination There were signs of mass defections among the conservative Southern Democrats who collectively hold the key to Judge Borks fate on the Senate floor In addition Senator Arlen Specter a Pennsylvania Republican who won high marks from both sides for his thoughtful questioning of Judge Bork announced that he was unpersuaded of the nominees commitment to fundamental principles of constitutional law and would vote no Judge Borks Senate supporters insisted that the nomination was still alive President Reagan lashed out several times last week at the nominees opponents accusing them of unfair and unfounded attacks But there were reports strongly denied by the White House that the nomination would soon be withdrawn Explanations for the turnabout ranged from the vital role of the black vote in modern Southern politics to the passionate and astute effort by the opponents coalition to the inherent weakness of the Administrations strategy in repackaging Judge Bork for years the countrys best known conservative legal theorist as a mainstream moderate All these observations were accurate But the rising political tide at weeks end threatened to obscure another factor more elusive yet central to the surprising turn of events Two visions of the Constitution had emerged in the hearings which amounted to a national lesson on the Constitution in its bicentennial year At its core the bitter confirmation battle had become a referendum on which vision was closer to those of the senators and of the American people One revealing moment came late in the second day of Judge Borks testimony when Senator Paul Simon of Illinois a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination reminded the judge of a remark he made in a speech two years ago What a court adds to one persons constitutional rights it subtracts from the rights of others Did he still believe that Mr Simon asked Well yes Senator Judge Bork replied I think its a matter of plain arithmetic This view of the Constitution as a kind of zerosum system in which one party can win only at anothers expense was sharply at variance with the vision put forward by Judge Borks opponents They spoke of the Constitution in organic rather than arithmetical terms as a system elastic enough so that adding to the rights of some did not necessarily diminish the rights of others Where Judge Bork insisted that the text of the Constitution and the intent of its Framers were the only legitimate guides for a judge the opponents portrayed the Constitution as a concept of liberty destined to continue growing well beyond the bounds of the text itself A New Light on Old Rulings This was not an exercise in platitudes Rather the hearings put a bicentennial spotlight on issues that many people regarded as long settled such as civil rights privacy and free speech but that suddenly took on a fresh urgency in the face of Judge Borks criticisms of decades of Supreme Court decisions in these areas The competing visions were crystallized by the debate over the decisions establishing a right of privacy which the nominees opponents see as an essential framework of constitutional protections for modern living While Judge Bork accepted the rulings on free speech and equal protection that he had strongly criticized over the years he continued to insist that the Courts privacy decisions were illegitimate because the right to privacy was not in the Constitution The Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives which the Court struck down on privacy grounds in 1965 was nutty Judge Bork said but the Courts remedy was worse It comes out of nowhere and doesnt have any rooting in the Constitution he said maintaining that lacking such a rooting in text or the Framers intent judges invite disastrous consequences Seeking to make the case for him as a mainstream jurist Judge Borks supporters tended to stress his credentials rather than his views Others such as Lloyd N Cutler a prominent Democratic lawyer built their testimony around lists of distinguished moderate Justices who dissented from the rulings Judge Bork was criticizing Contrariwise many opponents focused not on specific cases but on broad patterns For example Shirley M Hufstedler a former Federal judge and Carter Administration official said she found in Judge Borks record an effort to develop constitutional litmus tests to avoid his having to confront the grief and untidiness of the human condition She added The spirit and the grandeur of the Constitution lies in its magnificent abstractions and its deliberate ambiguities The hearings might well have gone another route If the opponents had permitted specific Constitutional controversies such as abortion or affirmative action to dominate the debate the result could have been a series of minireferendums that they could easily have lost But the committee chairman Joseph R Biden Jr conducting the hearings with good humor even as his Presidential bid collapsed kept the focus on the theme of fundamental rights that he had outlined in his opening statement I believe all Americans are born with certain inalienable rights whether or not the rights are spelled out in the text of the Constitution the Delaware Democrat said My rights are because I exist Judge Bork might have blunted the force of this argument by paying at least token obeisance to the idea of fundamental rights beyond the bounds of original intent But he chose not to If a judge abandons intention as his guide he said there is no law available to him and he begins to legislate a social agenda for the American people That goes well beyond his legitimate power He or she diminishes liberty instead of enhancing it
Court's Vacancy Clouds Term That Opens Today,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/05/us/court-s-vacancy-clouds-term-that-opens-today.html,The Supreme Court with one seat empty and the possibility of 4to4 deadlocks or postponed decisions in key cases opens its new term Monday facing an array of the politically charged issues that have fueled the battle over Judge Robert H Borks nomination The Court has already agreed to hear cases involving abortion religion free speech the death penalty executive power job bias and homosexual rights Most analysts believe Judge Bork could tip the ideologically polarized Court to the conservative side on most or all of these issues if confirmed While none of the cases raises the kind of question likely to produce sudden and sweeping constitutional change they are significant in their own right and could give whoever fills the vacancy an opportunity to push the Court in new directions The Rights of Juveniles The rights and legal responsibilities of juveniles and the constitutionality of laws designed to protect them from themselves and others figure in an unusually large number of cases With Judge Borks nomination to the Court in jeopardy and his supporters playing for time to reverse the momentum against him the vacancy created by the June 26 retirement of Justice Lewis F Powell Jr seems certain to remained unfilled for weeks perhaps months Among the 1000 petitions for review pending before the Court is a challenge by Michael K Deaver the former top Presidential aide whose perjury trial is set for Oct 19 to the constitutionality of law that provides for courtappointed special prosecutors Many Challenges Pending This is one of the nations most important and hotly debated legal issues and many experts consider Judge Bork a likely vote to strike down the law as an encroachment on Presidential power While some experts consider it unlikely the Court would agree to review the special prosecutor law unless and until somebody has been convicted under it there are so many challenges pending in lower courts that the Court will almost certainly resolve the issue sooner or later The unusually high likelihood of 4to4 deadlocks or efforts by the eight current Justices to avoid them by postponing resolution of key issues arises from the position Justice Powell occupied at the Courts ideological center In his last term for example Justice Powell was in the majority in 35 of the signed decisions out of a total of 145 signed decisions that were decided by 5to4 margins What Might Have Been If his seat had been vacant all of last term each of those 35 cases would apparently have ended in a 4to4 deadlock or might have been scheduled for reargument after the vacancy had been filled This is an option the Court sometimes has chosen when seats were vacant for extended periods Based on past practice Supreme Court experts consider it unlikely that Judge Bork or anyone else who fills the vacancy would vote in any case in which he was not able to participate in the oral argument The Court usually holds conferences and takes a tentative vote on cases the same week that the argument takes place As is usual on the first Monday in October the Court will hear hourlong arguments tomorrow in four cases the first of more than 150 it will have heard by April including the 90 it has already agreed to hear The three oldest members of the Court  Justices William J Brennan Jr 81 Thurgood Marshall 79 and Harry A Blackmun 78  have all been hospitalized with health problems in recent months But all plan to be on the bench Monday and to continue at least through the end of the 19871988 term next June or July Following are some of the cases the Court has already agreed to hear Rights of Juveniles The issues involving juveniles include challenges to the constitutionality of restrictions on minors access to abortion a law requiring a moment of silence for contemplation or prayer in school use of the death penalty to punish crimes by minors and censorship of a high school newspaper The abortion case to be argued Nov 3 is a state appeal of a 2to1 Federal appellate decision that struck down a 1983 Illinois law limiting the access of girls under 18 years old to abortions About 20 other states have similar laws some passed this year but at least half are not being enforced because of legal challenges The Illinois law would require girls under 18 who seek abortions either to wait 24 hours after both parents have been notified or to obtain state court approval The Supreme Court has narrowly approved somewhat similar restrictions on minors access to abortions but the appellate court found some aspects of the Illinois law unduly burdensome Four of the Courts present members have made it clear they want at least to narrow the Courts decisions protecting abortion rights and two of those have called for overruling them Earlier Remarks Recalled Judge Bork has strongly denounced as illegitimate the Courts creation in 1973 of a constitutional right to have an abortion although he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he would keep an open mind on whether that decision should be overruled Even if a majority of the Court were disposed to overrule the abortion precedents and leave state legislatures free to allow or to prohibit abortion it seems unlikely it would do so in the Illinois case That is because the state has not challenged the abortion precedents and contends that its restrictions on abortions for minors are consistent with them In addition the Court has not yet determined that it has jurisdiction to decide the states appeal in the abortion case and for complex procedural reasons may well find after hearing arguments in the case that it does not Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 The momentofsilence case to be argued Tuesday is the latest chapter in the continuing controversy over religion in public schools that erupted when the Court struck down organized school prayer and Biblereading in the early 1960s Focus on New Jersey Law The Court will consider whether Federal district and appellate courts erred in striking down as an unconstitutional establishment of religion a 1982 New Jersey law requiring that public schools permit students to observe one minute of silence daily for quiet and private contemplation and introspection Such momentofsilence laws have been adopted at one time or another in about 25 states including New York and Connecticut The Federal appeals court ruled by 2to1 that the law which did not directly encourage prayer as opposed to nonreligious contemplation or daydreaming was unconstitutional because it had the religious purpose of accomodating students who want an opportunity to pray silently But advocates of such laws argue that such accommodation is constitutional even if organized school prayer is not In 1985 the Court struck down an Alabama momentofsilence law on the narrow ground that its language and history manifested an intent actively to encourage prayer but five Justices strongly suggested that they would uphold any such laws that were neutral as to religion The Reagan Administration has argued that the New Jersey law is valid but that the Court should not rule on it because the state legislator who appealed the appellate decision and urged the Court to reinstate the law lacked legal standing Death Penalty and Juveniles The Court has also agreed to consider whether states may execute convicted murderers who were under 18 years old when they committed their crimes At least 32 of the nearly 2000 people on death row around the country were condemned for murders they committed as minors as were three of the 93 persons who have been executed in the United States since 1977 Two of those three were executed in Texas and one in South Carolina The pending case Thompson v Oklahoma No 866169 to be argued Nov 9 is an appeal by William Wayne Thompson who was the youngest of four defendants sentenced to death for a particularly brutal murder in 1983 when he was 15 In a case that could set an important precedent on constitutional rights of high school students the Court will review a Federal appellate ruling that a principals censorship of studentwritten articles about teenage sex and pregnancy in a school newspaper violated the First Amendment Arguments are set for Oct 13 Hazelwood School District v Kuhlmeier No 86836 Free Speech and Press The Court will hear several other significant cases involving freedom of speech and freedom of the press Judge Bork participated as a Federal appellate judge in two of them In Virginia v American Booksellers Association No 861034 the Court will hear a state appeal from a decision striking down a 1985 law aimed at protecting juveniles by restricting the display of certain sexually explicit books and magazines The case could affect laws in most other states that regulate the display of materials the sale of which to adults is protected by the Courts interpretation of the First Amendment but the sale of which to minors is illegal Arguments are set for Nov 4 The Court will hear arguments in December or January in Hustler Magazines appeal of 200000 award to the Rev Jerry Falwell for intentional infliction of emotional distress The magazine published a parody  found to be mean but not libelous  that depicted the television evangelist as an incestuous drunk Concern by Press Groups Many press groups have expressed concern that the lower court decision could set a dangerous precedent threatening cartoonists writers and comedians who engage in sharp criticism or mockery of public figures even when no false statements of fact are involved Hustler v Falwell No 861278 Judge Bork in a concurring opinion in a 1984 libel decision called for energetic judicial efforts to preserve press freedom in the area of defamation law including the freedom to publish wounding assessments of public figures But he has taken a narrower view of First Amendment rights in some other contexts such as his majority opinion for a Federal appellate panel in a 21 decison that the Supreme Court will review Arguments are set for Nov 9 Judge Borks opinion upheld a District of Columbia law allowing the police to bar hostile demonstrations and placards within 500 feet of a foreign embassy rejecting a suit by four conservatives who wanted to picket the Soviet and Nicaraguan embassies Governments Interest Upheld Over a sharp dissent he said the demonstrators First Amendment rights were outweighed by the Governments interest in protecting foreign diplomats from insult as well as embassy security Judge Bork would presumably not participate in reviewing his own decision even if confirmed Boos v Barry No 86803 On Monday the Court will hear a Reagan Administration appeal from a 2to1 appellate decision in which Judge Bork dissented The majority curbed somewhat the broad power claimed by the Administration to bar aliens associated with Communist organizations from visiting the United States to meet and exchange views with people here The case is a suit by several American groups and individuals including some members of Congress challenging the Administrations refusal of visas to Nicaraguas Interior Minister a former Italian general who belongs to a peace group that State Department says is controlled by the Soviet Union and two Cuban women said by the State Department to be agents of the Communist Party The appellate court majority held that a complex ambiguous 1977 act of Congress and related provisions barred the Administration from excluding such aliens solely because of affiliations with Communist organizations It ordered further proceedings to determine whether they could be excluded on other grounds Judge Bork disputed the majoritys reading of the law and called its decision a judicial intrusion into the Administrations conduct of foreign affairs Reagan v Abourezk No 86656 Civil Rights In an important job bias case the Court will hear arguments by a private employer and the Administration for making it harder than some lower courts have done for women and racial minorities to prove allegations of discrimination in subjective employment decisions The Administration and the employer have argued that in discrimination suits challenging subjective promotion procedures as opposed to cases involving objective criteria such as test scores plaintiffs should be required to prove discriminatory motivation They have argued further that evidence of adverse statistical impact on women or minorities alone is not enough to prove illegal discrimination Lower courts have been deeply split on the issue with some upholding challenges to subjective employment decisions based almost entirely on statistical evidence The Justice Department brief argues that this approach would force employers to institute preferential quotas to avoid liability The case is an appeal by a former bank teller whose claim that a Fort Worth bank discriminated against her and other blacks by promoting less senior whites to supervisory positions was rejected by Federal district and appellate courts Watson v Fort Worth Bank  Trust No 866139 A New York City Case The Court will also consider a suit by white New York City police officers seeking promotions to sergeant who said they had been discriminated against as a result of a courtapproved settlement of a job bias suit brought by black and Hispanic candidates The Court has indicated it will not decide whether the whites were illegally discriminated against but rather will determine what procedures those aggrieved by such affirmative action settlements must use to challenge them Marino v Ortiz No 861415 The homosexual rights issue is posed by a Central Intelligence Agency appeal in a suit by a former employee who was dismissed despite an excellent service record on the ground that his homosexuality posed a security risk A Federal appeals court had ordered further proceedings in the case saying that the agency might have violated the mans constitutional rights if it had dismissed him solely for his homosexual orientation as opposed to homosexual conduct The Administration argued in its appeal Webster v Doe No 861294 that the rights of homosexual government employees generally are irrelevant to the case because CIA employees can be dismissed for any or for no reason Insider Trading The Court has cast a shadow over a key legal theory used by the Government to prosecute insider trading and other forms of securities fraud by its unexpected decision to hear the appeal of R Foster Winans the former Wall Street Journal reporter who passed on and profited from his advance knowledge of asyet unpublished articles Arguments are set for Wednesday Mr Winans and two codefendants were convicted of securities fraud mail fraud and wire fraud based on a scheme in which they and another man misappropriated the newspapers proprietary information  the contents and timing of Mr Winanss Heard on the Street columns  to buy and sell stocks likely to be affected The expansive misappropriation theory that the Government used to prosecute Mr Winans could broaden the liability both of insiders who have access to secrets of publicly traded companies and of others who like Mr Winans profit in the stock market by other allegedly unethical means But the Courts June 24 ruling in another case that the mail fraud law can be used only to prosecute frauds involving property rights has cast some doubt on the reach of all the laws under which Mr Winans was convicted The Winans appeal is Carpenter v United States No 86422 Merger Talks Are Focus In another securities case the Court will consider the circumstances in which companies must disclose publicly their merger negotiations and in particular whether company officials may falsely deny rumors of negotiations until an agreement in principle has been reached Arguments are set for Nov 2 Basic Inc v Levinson No 86279 In a case that could affect the prices of cameras watches perfumes and other costly imported goods the Court will hear arguments Tuesday on a challenge under a 1930 law to Federal regulations that allow retailers to import and sell certain goods at discount prices over the objections of the trademark owners These gray market goods are typically trademarked authentic foreignmade products such as Cartier watches and Nikon cameras that independent retailers such as K Mart Corporation buy abroad at low prices without the consent of the distributors who own the United States trademarks K Mart v Cartier Nos 86495 86624 and 86625 Another case of importance to discounters is an antitrust suit that could clarify the circumstances in which manufacturers may agree with distributors of their products to terminate other distributors for pricecutting Business Electronics v Sharp Electronics No 851910
As the Bork Vote Approaches,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/05/opinion/as-the-bork-vote-approaches.html,LEAD I am an enthusiastic supporter of the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court This should not surprise anyone What should be surprising is that there is such a political hullaballoo over this nomination I am an enthusiastic supporter of the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court This should not surprise anyone What should be surprising is that there is such a political hullaballoo over this nomination If our citizens do not find this surprising then I would have to say there is an insufficient understanding out there of the role of the Federal judiciary in our constitutional democracy The most heated polemics about the Bork nomination come from people who worry about the policy outcomes they believe are apt to result from it The fact that so many voices have politicized the nomination in this way suggests that our civics teachers have failed us We no longer understand what judging is and how it differs from legislating I say we yet I believe it is not really the American people that are confused  merely the activist cadres that have mobilized on the Bork nomination who treat the process of judging as meaningless in itself important only in terms of the policy result to which it leads This way of thinking about the role of judges ignores or even denies the difference between that role and the role of legislators To the resultoriented judging is merely a continuation of legislation by other means and the Supreme Court is in effect just a third house of Congress sitting atop the other two vetoing their enactments or changing those enactments beyond recognition Such a role for the judiciary is intolerable in a Government such as ours where the people are the source of legislative legitimacy Judges in our system of governance are supposed to adjudicate disputes between and among litigants  that is to decide cases and controversies In the process of dealing with actual cases brought to them judges must construe and interpret laws including the Constitution because in the exercise of judicial review they must insure that legislative or administrative actions do not transgress constitutional limits If however judicial review goes beyond this role and judges make instead of interpret the law then the personal values of unelected judges are given the force of law This is wrong The foregoing remarks on the nature of judicial review reflect closely the views of Judge Bork His constitutional reasoning is pristine and it is appropriate to note as we celebrate the 200th birthday of our Constitution his fidelity to the Framers grand vision Yet the ruckus goes on confusing constitutional reasoning with policy preferences To take only the most talked about example look at Roe v Wade which established a right to abortion Judge Bork has been very discreet about his views if any on the merits of the abortion issue This is fine What are relevant are his views on the constitutional reasoning behind the Courts interpretation in this area That Roe is rickety in this regard has been recognized by scholars with widely differing views on abortion including Justice Sandra Day OConnor Prof John Hart Ely and Archibald Cox But that has not stopped some from simplistically labeling Judge Bork antiabortion The point is that it is possible to have an opinion on the merits of a decision separately from ones opinion on the merits of the issue Prolife groups support Judge Bork because they believe Roe cannot withstand unprejudiced scrutiny But he has made no pledges nor will he nor should he In short the nomination challenges every sector of politics that has been relying on the Court rather than the political process to achieve its agenda That challenge is this Can your goals survive being booted back into the truly democratic process  into the legislative arena Now to confirm or not to confirm that is the question That issue should be decided on Judge Borks record as a brilliant student lawyer professor Solicitor General and court of appeals judge never reversed by the Supreme Court It should be decided on a philosophy of judicial restraint honed over a lifetime I inveigh against deciding it on pure symbolism Judge Bork as the false boogeyman of the left who will singlehandedly veto all sorts of social programs and nullify individual rights or Judge Bork as the ersatz champion of the right who will singlehandedly adopt a conservative policy agenda Stuff and nonsense The American public I am convinced wants a decision on the merits
Taking a Stand on Confirmation: Senatorial Voices For and Against Bork,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/us/taking-a-stand-on-confirmation-senatorial-voices-for-and-against-bork.html,Since the end of testimony about Judge Robert H Bork before the Judiciary Committee 20 members of the Senate including some influential undecided senators have announced their positions on his nomination to the Supreme Court Following are excerpts from some of the statements of the 4 senators who favor confirmation and the 16 who oppose it FOR CONFIRMATION Phil Gramm Republican of Texas In America we hold Presidential elections to choose between candidates representing differing philosophies of government but we appoint people to the Supreme Court based on their integrity experience and ability Because Judge Borks critics cannot successfully attack his talent and character they instead attack the Presidents philosophy Broad public approval of that philosophy  strict construction of the Constitution a belief that the courts should interpret the law rather than make the law and a high concern for the rights of victims as well as criminals  manifested itself in Ronald Reagans two landslide elections Critics of Robert Bork and Ronald Reagan seek to gain a philosophical victory in the Senate that they were denied by the American people in the last two Presidential elections David L Boren Democrat of Oklahoma The question before the Senate is not whether Judge Bork is the person that each senator would have chosen to appoint to the Supreme Court but rather the question is whether or not a senator should consent to the nomination After a careful review of his record and the proceedings of the confirmation hearings I have found no sufficient basis for refusing to consent to his appointment Judge Bork is clearly qualified by intellectual ability character and experience to serve on the Court While some of his detractors have argued that he would not follow precedent in protecting the rights of all citizens a careful evaluation of his record does not support these concerns My study of the record leads me to predict that if Robert Bork becomes a member of the Supreme Court he will surprise many of his strongest critics and staunchest supporters by being more moderate than either expects John McCain Republican of Arizona One should remember that if our courts are free to go beyond the terms of our cherished Constitution to create new constitutional mandates that some might find acceptable the Supreme Court in later years could use that freeroaming power to create mandates we dont like Neither course is sound The only sound course for the courts is to apply the law as its written not create it as they might wish it to be Again the issue is not whether Bork is antiabortion or antiprivacy The question is this Is Robert Bork unfit for the Supreme Court because he believes this decision [ Roe v Wade ] is logically and constitutionally flawed I think not Of course we must protect minorities and even majorities from societal discrimination But this doesnt mean that because hes criticized the methodology the Courts used hes any less committed to full and fair enforcement of the equal protection clause All it means is that hes a smart and outspoken enough legal scholar to point out some of the very real problems with the Courts legal reasoning AGAINST CONFIRMATION Senator Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona Judge Bork is different from Justice Sandra Day OConnor Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia He has spent his career as a legal scholar criticizing in the harshest terms the Court and its decisions He has used inflammatory terms to criticize the decisions that most people in this country credit with giving some measure of equality and respect to all of us While I am no longer concerned about such things as his integrity and his role in the Saturday Night Massacre I am more concerned than ever about his lack of understanding and compassion about the role of the courts and the Constitution in our society I believe that the Constitution does protect the right to privacy I am disturbed that an individual who is as intelligent and as analytical as Judge Bork is unable to find this right and would leave American citizens privacy rights at risk of government intrusion at the will of the majority There are a great many things about Judge Bork to admire and that recommend his confirmation to the Supreme Court I sincerely regret that this issue has become so personal and so vitrolic I have been impressed with Judge Borks candor and intelligence But I do not believe the US Senate can take the risk that putting Judget Bork on the Surpeme Court entails His entire career indicated a lack of understanding of the effect of judicial decisions on real people Judge Bork views the Constitutions as a bloodless and sterile contract instead of a bond between diverse and competing people to use common sense and consideration of each other as a framework to build a nation John H Chafee Republican of Rhode Island As a Senator I have supported a host of civil rights and equal rights legislation including extension of the privacy doctrine to women and have long favored a broad interpretation of the doctrine of free speech Judge Bork has written in opposition to these positions He has since stated that his views have changed on some of these matters On some of the remaining he has indicated that while he does not agree with the constitutional basis on which the decision were reached he would not necessarily vote to overturn them All this has left me extremely uncomfortable Judge Bork would be sitting on the Supreme Court for several decades Some of the issues that appear settled will undoubtedly appear again There will be new issues that arise that I believe will require not just a review of the exact constitutional language but interpreting the overall thrust of the Constitution Perhaps Judge Bork would change his thinking process or his judgments when confronted with these challenges However the stakes are so great that I am not prepared to take that risk Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut I will vote no on the nomination of Robert Bork The basic reason relates to my unwillingness to accept several months of seemingly innocuous sophisticated banter by an eager nominee as substitute for that nominees lifetime of unrelenting criticism or disdain for landmark laws giving our constitutional ideals their highest and best meaning Certainly nominee Bork is correct when he prods a nation to legislative and executive rather than judicial resolution of its problems But as a commentator of 15 years vintage Robert Bork knew that were it not for the courts much of our dream would lay trashed by the political hesitancy of our leaders Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey The question here is not whether people can change in a generic sense but whether Judge Bork has changed since he expressed his hostile attitudes towards civil rights laws and court decisions One one hand we have the stated conversion of a man who in his lifetime has had several different viewpoints On the other side we have the lengthy list of current and past positions hostile to civil rights from the nominee of an Administration which supports subsidizing segregated schools During the confirmation hearings several members of the Judiciary Committee tried to pin Judge Bork down on how he regarded the importance of precedence Would he they asked seek to overturn decisions with which he disagreed His answer no with respect to some areas unclear as to others He chose ambiguity on the central question A law school professor dissects precedents A circuit court judge applies precedents A Supreme Court Justice sets precedents If a professor slips back temporarily into the blank spots of racial insensitivity it hurts only his immediate friends who believe him to be a different person If a Justice of the Supreme Court slips back it could hurt generations of Americans Ask yourself how you will feel 5 7 or 10 years from now if the Supreme Court with Judge Bork as the decisive vote issues a series of decisions that effectively ends 32 years of progress in civil rights Ask yourself how you will face your neighbors and supporters who believed in you Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania I am troubled by his writings that unless there is adherence to original intent there is no judicial legitimacy and without such legitimacy there can be no judicial review This approach could jeopardize the most fundamental prinicple of US constitutional law  the supremacy of judicial review  when Judge Bork concedes original intent is so hard to find and major public figures contend that the Supreme Court does not have the last word on the Constitution I am further concerned by his insistence on Madisonian majoritarianism in the absence of an explicit constitutional right to limit legislative action Conservative Justices have traditionally protected individual and minority rights without a specifically enumerated right or proof of original intent where there are fundamental values rooted in the tradition of our people Thirtythree years after the fact there is still no acceptable rationale for the desegregation of the schools in the District of Columbia according to Judge Borks doctrine of original intent It is not that the majority in a democracy can take care of itself while individuals and minorities often cannot but rather that our history has demonstrated the majority benefits when equality enables minorities to become part of the everexpanding majority For the first time at his confirmation hearings Judge Bork said he would apply equal protection broadly in accordance with the Courts settled doctrine I have substantial doubt about Judge Borks application of this fundamental legal principle where he has over the years disagreed with the scope of coverage and has a settled philosophy that constitutional rights do not exist unless specified or are within original intent
Political Memo; Bush and Dole Bring Order to G.O.P,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/us/political-memo-bush-and-dole-bring-order-to-gop.html,While the Democratic Presidential campaign has dissolved into grim uncertainty the Republican contest like the party itself is considerably more orderly The clarity of the Republican race comes in two parts First Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole have clearly emerged in the eyes of party officials and in the polls as dominant over their competitors For the moment at least they are the superpowers of Republican politics Second Pat Robertson the former television preacher who is now a fulltime politician is threatening to eliminate all the others in the race The campaigns of Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and former Gov Pete du Pont of Delaware once highly promising are in grave jeopardy as even some of their supporters concede And Alexander M Haig Jr the former Secretary of State has yet to find a message that would let him surprise his detractors in the party and the press Democrats in 1984 Supporters of Mr Kemp Mr du Pont and Mr Haig are quick to point out that the October line on Presidential nominating politics has not always been reliable In the fall of 1983 they note the conventional wisdom held that the Democratic Presidential contest was between Walter F Mondale and Senator John Glenn of Ohio But when the real voting started Mr Glenn went nowhere and former Senator Gary Hart not much noticed in the fall emerged as the challenger to Mr Mondale Those in the back of the Republican pack imagine themselves as this years Gary Hart  the 1984 version of course  and insist that either Mr Dole or Mr Bush will falter and that they will rise to challenge the survivor But for the moment their path is blocked by Mr Robertson who has turned small victories in preliminary organizing contests into large waves of publicity Last month he beat both Mr Bush and Mr Dole in a straw poll in Iowa Then a few days later in coalition with Mr Kemps backers Mr Robertson beat Mr Bush in a procedural test in the Republican state committee in Michigan The vote was important because it kept a large number of potential Bush supporters out of Michigans complicated delegate selection process The result is that Mr Bush could wind up in third place next January when Michigan delegates to the Republican National Convention are alloted Mobilizing Christian Voters Mr Robertsons contention is that he can mobilize devout previously apolitical Chritians to vote in Republican caucuses and primaries But his competitors insist that the Iowa and Michigan victories will not mean much next year Theres no question said Roger Stone a consultant to Mr Kemp that Robertson brings new people into the contest who vote for him and so in a small process he can do well But theres a limit to how much he can get when the suffrage goes up to 150000 as in the Iowa caucuses Perhaps But Mr Robertson has clearly benefitted from the national publicity that surrounded his early successes Last weekend a poll of 2292 Southern Republicans conducted for The Atlanta Journal and Constitution by the Roper Organization brought some bad news for the bottom of the Republican pack It showed Mr Bush far ahead with 46 percent followed by Mr Dole at 19 percent and Mr Robertson in third at 10 percent Trailing were Mr Kemp at 7 percent Mr Haig at 6 percent and Mr du Pont at 2 percent Mr Stone was quick to point out that Mr Robertsons lead over Mr Kemp was close to the polls margin of sampling error two percentage points But all summer long the Kemp campaign had been touting Mr Kemps solid thirdplace position in national polls as a sign that their candidate was moving into serious contention Now Mr Kemps JunetoAugust run looks to have been as fragile as summer love Gaffe in Europe For Mr Bush the last couple of months have brought both good news and bad The bad news lay in his defeats in Iowa and Michigan and in his gaffe last week in Europe in which he seemed to compare Soviet workers favorably to those in Detroit The gaffe was undoubtedly bad news But by losing in Iowa and Michigan Mr Bush seems to have changed the flow of the Republican contest in a way that might turn to his favor by having been knocked down a peg Mr Bush instead of running against himself is now in a real contest with Mr Dole The dynamic of the race before was Will George Bush collapse and Bush couldnt win that race said Eddie Mahe an independent Republican consultant If its a straight contest with Dole Bush can actually win So Bush ends up being helped by Dole gaining strength The Bush people are helping this view along touting Mr Dole as the frontrunner in Iowa and suggesting that if Mr Dole loses Iowa he is out of the contest Still Mr Bushs managers are not about to see their man lose any more public battles Lee Atwater Mr Bushs campaign manager has been sent several platoons into Florida and has spent time there himself to make sure the Vice President wins a straw poll at a party meeting in November If Mr Bush loses that vote it will be a real loss his aides will not be able to offer the nonchalance defense that they tried in Iowa  to say they were taken by surprise Conciliatory Attitude Mr Doles backers in the meantime are pleased with the way things are developing David Keene a consultant to Mr Dole said he is quite happy that Mr Doles foes have been deriding the Senate minority leaders campaign organization all year long It makes small organizational coups such as Mr Doles second place finishing ahead of Mr Bush in that Iowa straw poll look all that much more significant Mr Dole has also been quite conciliatory toward Mr Robertson watching with what must be considerable satisfaction as supporters of Mr Bush and Mr Robertson say the most awful things about each other particularly in Michigan If Mr Robertson should ever hold the balance of power in the Republican contest Mr Bush could have a very hard time coaxing Mr Robertson into the Bush cause Mr Haigs campaign aides meanwhile insist that those who ignore him will be surprised next year They note that he is running third behind Mr Bush and Mr Dole in several state polls Mr Haig argues that at a time when the nation is looking for real expertise especially in foreign policy who could be better than a former White House Chief of Staff and Supreme Allied Commander in Europe Good News for Democrats When they look over to the seemingly straightforward Republican race ailing Democrats might get even more depressed than they are already But the Republican race may yet have some good news in store for the Democrats First the secondtier Republican candidates are not about to accept elimination from the contest quietly Mr Kemps forces say they will pour money into Iowa for television commercials attacking Mr Bush on such divisive questions as social security taxes and abortion And then there is Mr Robertson himself Despite his strong showings in test votes he still has extremely high negative ratings in the polls Thus the better Mr Robertson does the more he is likely to scare voters who are moderate on social issues into the arms of the Democrats Mr Robertsons presense in the contest may yet prove providential for the Democratic Party  if the Democrats only stay out of the news enough to let the cameras focus on him
What Went Wrong; Reagan's Popularity Was Not Enough To End Fears of Shift on Social Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/us/what-went-wrong-reagan-s-popularity-was-not-enough-end-fears-shift-social-issues.html,In their speeches preceding the Senate Judiciary Committees vote today on Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court members of the committee were unified by one impulse the need to explain what had happened Surely some explanation was needed for one of the most dramatic reversals in recent political history How could a man confirmed unanimously by the Senate to a powerful judicial post barely six years ago and nominated to the Supreme Court by a President who carried 49 states in the last election see his confirmation chances dwindle to the vanishing point in barely a month The way the Democrats on the committee saw it Judge Bork defeated himself by holding to ideas about the Constitution sharply at variance with those shared by a majority of the committee of the Senate and of the people the senators represent To the five Republicans on the committee who voted for Judge Borks confirmation the nominee was a victim the target of a welloiled propaganda campaign that succeeded in turning a carefully nuanced scholar into a frightening onedimensional caricature An Agent and a Victim At least in part both sides are right Judge Bork was both the agent of his own undoing and a victim of outside forces But those forces were not the special interests the Republicans excoriated Rather Judge Bork was a victim of a particular moment in history At a time when the Reagan Presidency was nearing its end the Supreme Court stood evenly balanced or nearly so on questions of abortion religion and race By arguing that Judge Bork would tip the courts balance to the right on these issues his opponents drew on the deep amibivalence that many Americans even those who have supported Mr Reagan hold toward the Administrations domestic goals There is a certain irony to the image of Judge Bork as a victim of the Reagan revolution because insofar as he has made his views known he does not subscribe to key portions of the Administrations social agenda He is not a religious fundamentalist He has never been an active opponent of abortion Becoming a Symbol But because his constitutional theories would if carried to their logical conclusion remove many of the legal obstacles that now exist to implementing the Adminstrations most bitterly disputed domestic policies he became a symbol of that agenda Much of the population including Reagan voters has always been uneasy about Mr Reagans social goals  an end to abortion and affirmative action and dramatically lower barriers between church and state Despite two landslide elections and six years of Republican control of the Senate Mr Reagan has been unable to achieve these objectives or to persuade the nation to share them Polls show for example that a majority of Americans remain opposed to the Reagan views on abortion Large numbers of people supported Mr Reagan for the sake of their own pocketbooks or because they disliked the previous course of American foreign policy while averting their eyes from the parts of his message that they found deeply troubling Judge Bork would have been in a position to enshrine the Reagan social agenda in the Constitution itself His nomination died when Senators became convinced that this was not what the public wanted Touching a Chord The embittered Judiciary Committee Republicans were correct when they acknowledged the powerful and sophisticated nature of the public relations campaign against Judge Bork And Judge Bork himself in five days before the Judiciary Committee bolstered the opponents efforts by continuing to criticize Supreme Court rulings regarded as nearly sacred by civil rights organizations and by refusing to accept the notion that the Constitution embodies a right of privacy or other rights that the document does not spell out in so many words But the opposition efforts would have been wasted if they had not touched a powerful chord in the country Meaning of Privacy The issue that jelled for the opposition surprisingly was privacy The number of senators who gave prominence to the privacy issue in their speeches opposing Judge Bork was striking Indeed the privacy issue underwent a fascinating transformation during the course of this confirmation debate Before the confirmation hearings began the word privacy in political discourse was widely understood as a metaphor for abortion a politically dangerous topic During the hearings privacy became another metaphor entirely It came to stand for the whole theme of fundamental rights the concept of an expansive Constitution in contrast to Judge Borks view that the Constitution was limited by its precise language and the intent of its 18th century framers The abortion question itself became subsumed into the broader question of a generalized right to privacy a concept that politicians were suddenly rushing to embrace The elevation of privacy to a cherished place on the political agenda if that is what has happened is yet one more ironic twist to the Reagan Administrations effort to shape the Supreme Court
"Bush, in Iowa, Clarifies Stand on Legal Abortions",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/us/bush-in-iowa-clarifies-stand-on-legal-abortions.html,Vice President Bush said today that he favored allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest clarifying the stand he took in the 1984 campaign He said then that he supported President Reagans position that the only exception to a flat ban should be when a mothers life was threatened although he later changed this by saying he favored the other exceptions as well Today dealing with an issue of great emotional impact to the Republican right wing which carries particular weight in Iowa he clearly favored all three exceptions The issue arose when Mr Bush was asked his position on abortion in a questionandanswer session with students at Columbus High School This Is a Tough Subject I oppose abortion I oppose Federal funding for abortion he said I want to see the Roe v Wade decision changed so that it wont legalize abortion Mr Bush who spoke to several hundred teenagers went on to say You know this is a tough subject for people Its very difficult subject for a lot of people even to discuss A few years ago you couldnt even talk about it openly a million and a half abortions a year a million and a half Thats not right Err on the side of life err on the side of human life The Vice President said that he favored adoption education and family planning and teaching about what causes having babies He then added I would make the exception on the amendment of rape incest and the life of the mother But that is the position I have and I have no hesistancy in stating it Mr Bushs voice appeared to crack as he went on to described being at a christening last year for an adopted granddaughter My wife and I stood there and watched and thanked God thanked god her mother opted came down on the side of life he said Mr Bush said later that while there had been unsafe abortions before the 1973 Supreme Court decision There werent a million and half abortion a year when abortions were illegal either In the 1984 campaign Mr Bush had endorsed the Presidents view which opposes abortion except to protect the mothers life In September of that year he lectured reporters My position is like Ronald Reagans Put that down mark that down A month later in a nationally televised debate with the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine A Ferraro Mr Bush explained an evolution in his thinking brought on by the millions of abortions that had taken place since the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions You know there has been  I have to make a confession  an evolution in my position Theres been 15 million abortions since 1973 and I dont take that lightly Theres been a million and a half this year My Position Has Evolved The President and I do favor a human rights amendment I favor one that would have an exception for incest and rape and he doesnt but we both only for the life of the mother And I agree with him on that So yes my position has evolved But Id like to see the American who faced with 15 million abortions isnt rethinking his or her position and Ill just stand with the answer I support the Presidents position  and comfortably  from a moral standpoint Mr Bush has been moving away from Mr Reagan on several policy issues favoring more Federal spending for education and sharply opposing a Central American peace plan that he has said would harm the United Statessupported rebels in Nicaragua Abortion and support for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment were among the issues that Mr Reagan and Mr Bush disagreed on most sharply when they competed in the 1980 campaign

"Washington Talk: The Bork Hearings; For Biden: Epoch of Belief, Epoch of Incredulity",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/08/us/washington-talk-the-bork-hearings-for-biden-epoch-of-belief-epoch-of-incredulity.html,To borrow a phrase from Dickens it has been the best of times and the worst of times for Joe Biden In the three weeks that he spent presiding over the confirmation hearings of Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court the Senator from Delaware rode what surely was one of the most amazing roller coasters in recent political history The Judiciary Committee chairman began the hearings as a contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination  not the leader but a strong rival who was raising money and drawing crowds By the midpoint of the hearings his campaign was over ruined by disclosures that he had spoken a British politicians words without attribution and had sugarcoated his academic achievements But at the end Joseph R Biden Jr emerged as perhaps the hearings biggest winner Praise From All Sides He not only earned praise from all sides for the fairness and good humor with which he ran the proceedings He also scored high points on substance in the face of widespread skepticism about whether he had the intellectual depth or the temperament to preside over hearings that promised to turn into a profound constitutional debate The hearings lived up to expectations and Senator Biden exceeded them It was a remarkable job Kate Michelman director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said in an interview Ms Michelman was one of many leaders of antiBork organizations to confess to having harbored doubts about whether Senator Biden was the man for the job We had concerns about all the things happening in his life she explained But as his campaign was crumbling around him he was able to stay focused on the most important thing He picked up on issues he didnt go overboard and no one else was as well prepared on the privacy issue With Both Regret and Pride Reflecting on the last few weeks in an interview today Senator Biden spoke with both regret and pride as he recalled two of the most difficult moments One came on Sept 17 the third day of the hearings when he vowed at a tense news conference that he would stay in the Presidential race then went directly into the hearing room to resume his own questioning of Judge Bork The other came six days later as he announced his withdrawal from the Presidential campaign and then walked into the hearing room to question Lloyd N Cutler one of Judge Borks star witnesses opening the session with the comment Look my business is behind us Lets move on The two hardest witnesses came after the two hardest moments Senator Biden said today But in a sense I found satisfaction from that It reinforced to me that this was not an end it was a beginning I wasnt going back to Wilmington Delaware to sit in my library I was going back to engage in a debate of consequence with two of my most worthy opponents The 44yearold Senator knew exactly what some of his allies in the antiBork fight were saying about him There were three questions he said Can Biden be fair Can Biden control himself And is there any substance there any depth to Biden The expectations of me were so low that I could have done almost anything except punch Bork and people would have said Hes not as bad as I thought  But the Senator said he nonetheless entered the hearings confident and unfazed because he felt thoroughly prepared He said he had spent 6hour even 10hour sessions with constitutional scholars like Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School and Walter Dellinger of Duke in addition to days at home in Wilmington reading books they had recommended on jurisprudence and constitutional theory I Knew I Had No Choice All of this was time away from the Presidential campaign In a sense it was a great escape from the campaign Senator Biden said One of the great advantages was that I enjoyed it Besides I knew I had no choice He continued I knew enough about Bork to know that ultimately there was no way to get around having to engage him directly It had to be me not the staff And I couldnt merely be schooled in what Bork had said I had to be sure in my own mind what I thought about the Constitution That process served him well Senator Biden decided to build the hearings around the notion that the Constitution embodies a concept of liberty including a right to privacy that goes beyond the rights that are detailed in the text It was this theme on which Senator Biden opened the proceedings and on which he closed them Tuesday as the committee rejected Judge Bork by a vote of 9 to 5 that gave coherence to the entire effort Several of the Senators key advisers had argued against taking this approach calling it too elusive too hard to sell to the public But Senator Biden persisted He said he knew from his own experience in representing Delaware in the Senate since 1972 that people in even a relatively a conservative state like his are responsive to civil liberties issues Most liberals think of civil liberties as their Achilles heel he said It isnt People understand how fragile their liberties are I believe the American people have a genuine and justifiable fear of government intrusion in what they instinctively know is going to be an ever more intrusive world Judge Bork by holding to his view that the only constitutional rights are those the Constitution explicitly grants provided a perfect foil for Senator Bidens theme In fact the Senator said today he knew within the first hour of Judge Borks testimony that the fight against confirmation could be won With Judge Borks nomination virtually certain to be either defeated by the full Senate or withdrawn Senator Biden was savoring his victory today But he said the pleasure was somewhat tempered by the empathy he felt for Judge Bork whom he said he had telephoned after the vote Tuesday Its presumptuous to say you know how somebody feels the Senator said I dont know how he feels But I empathize intellectually and emotionally It once looked so certain for him He was so up I know how that feels

"THE PRO-BORK SPLIT; Within Administration, Two Factions Long at Odds Now Blame Each Other",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/09/us/pro-bork-split-within-administration-two-factions-long-odds-now-blame-each-other.html,The apparent failure of Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court has touched off a Republican hunt for scapegoats Within the Reagan Administration two factions that have struggled for power for almost seven years  conservative purists and moderate pragmatists  have been blaming each other for days The purists with whom the President has generally sided are eager to continue the proBork fight for several reasons Doing so will give them the chance they say to score political points by illuminating Democratic tactics they consider character assassination Moreover demonstrating their tenacity amounts to psychological warfare a warning that any fight over a future nominee would be as bruising as the Bork battle However one earlier reason for a showdown forcing Democrats to cast their votes and thus risk political retaliation no longer applies Most Democrats have already stated their opposition and think they are on the right side of the issue anyway The Administrations pragmatic faction worries that a drawnout fight could backfire and endanger President Reagans next nominee by delaying the Senate schedule In addition they say continuing the fight will only poison the atmosphere in the Senate and harden the lines of polarization that have been created between the proBork and antiBork forces Divergent Outlooks In general terms the purists believe that Mr Reagan was elected because of his strongly conservative views on many issues from antiabortion to anticommunism and that the country is ready to support him The pragmatists say that the country is not so conservative as the purists believe and that the Administration must make compromises in order to achieve at least part of its aims This puristpragmatist split has frequently been papered over by Mr Reagans enormous personal popularity and communication skills But as the Presidents political standing has dropped the split has become more visible The Bork fight has brought it completely into the open It was the purists who won the fight to nominate Judge Bork in the first place Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d the head of that faction encourged the President to select Judge Bork even though Howard H Baker Jr the chief of staff warned that the judge would have a tough time winning confirmation But once Judge Bork was nominated the pragmatists took control of the campaign to get him confirmed They did so by devising a mainstream strategy an attempt to portray the nominee as a jurist whose views resembled those of the man he would replace Justice Lewis F Powell Jr The Result No Sale The resulting hybrid that of a judge of welldocumented conservative views trying to portray himself as a moderate simply did not sell either to the public or to the Senate A result was a confused and somewhat slippery image that failed to excite the judges supporters while enraging his opponents The White House hoped that Judge Bork would be able to overcome these contradictions by the force of his personality But strategists known for their mastery of television failed to see that the judge would come across badly Everything from his long legal explanations to his unkempt beard worked against him These basic miscalculations were among many made by the White House To the purists the departure of Justice Powell had provided a chance  perhaps their last chance  to enact key elements of Mr Reagans agenda that had been repeatedly rejected by Congress They promoted Judge Bork as a man who would help reverse Court decisions legalizing abortion banning organized prayer in schools and upholding affirmative action programs to correct racial discrimination Blame for Baker The major mistake this faction believes was the attempt to sell the judge as a mainstream thinker not as a pure conservative and they place much of the blame on Mr Baker the chief of staff Moreover goes this argument Mr Baker and his aides did not fight vigorously enough for Judge Bork because they did not share his legal views Bakers a lovely man said one Republican strategist with close ties to the White House but hes a compromiser a conciliator He doesnt have the stomach for a fight To the pragmatists the key mistake was choosing Judge Bork in the first place In this view the purists had failed to understand the importance of the 1986 election when despite President Reagans campaigning across the country appealing for a Republican Senate the Democrats swept back into the majority As a result of that election Democrats felt they had a mandate to oppose any Reagan nominee who could be characterized as an extremist They also gained control of the Senate machinery which meant they would control the confirmation process including when the hearings were called which witnesses would be heard and what questions would be asked first The Pregame Scrimmaging In fact the campaign against Judge Bork really began before the election when Democratic senators mounted efforts against two nominees to lower Federal court seats Daniel A Manion and Jefferson Sessions At the time the Democrats described these battles as scrimmages pregame preparations for the Super Bowl of judicial nominations a Supreme Court selection who could tip the balance of the Court toward the right The question now is whether the purists or the pragmatists will prevail in naming a new Court nominee So far the President has not tipped his hand
More Names Are Quietly Studied For Nomination to Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/09/us/more-names-are-quietly-studied-for-nomination-to-supreme-court.html,There seemed to be no obvious frontrunner today as Justice Department officials outwardly vowing to fight on with Judge Robert H Borks apparently doomed nomination for the Supreme Court sifted names of other possible nominees More than a dozen who have been on Reagan Administration lists have also been mentioned on the political grapevine this week most conspicuously five Federal appeals court judges Roger J Miner of Albany J Clifford Wallace of San Diego Laurence H Silberman of Washington DC Patrick E Higginbotham of Dallas and Pasco M Bowman II of Kansas City Mo Officials refused to confirm reports by sources close to the Justice Department that they were looking beyond Judge Bork and cautioned against any assumption that a definitive short list existed While Judge Bork was the clear first choice of President Reagan and top Justice Department officials there was no clear second choice then and there does not appear to be one now Reagan Reported Still Adamant The process of selecting the next nominee is complicated both by President Reagans wrath at any suggestion that a new nominee be found and by the differing outlooks and politically wounded condition of the two men most likely to influence his choice Howard H Baker Jr his pragmatic chief of staff and Edwin Meese 3d his ardently conservative Attorney General Each is privately blamed by adherents of the other as bungling the Bork nomination battle Mr Meese battered by multiple allegations of impropriety is also under investigation by the Federal special prosecutor Officials and others said the prospects of Judge Higginbotham a respected moderately conservative Federal appellate judge from Dallas who had been on the White House list of runnersup when Judge Bork was chosen may have been hurt by his backers Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona both Democrats publicly backed the 48yearold Judge Higginbotham for the next nomination while opposing Judge Bork Administration officials are angry at them and some conservatives argue that a Higginbotham nomination now would look like capitulation RighttoLife Opposition While Administration conservatives have been pleased by some of Judge Higginbothams rulings which are in tune with their views on affirmative action and some other key issues some antiabortion groups oppose him The righttolife opposition is based largely on speculation about Judge Higginbothams position on abortion based on his 1986 opinion for a threejudge panel striking down provisions of a Louisiana law that barred experimentation with aborted fetuses and required physicians within 24 hours of performing abortions to inform the women personally of their rights to have the fetus cremated or buried Judge Miner 53 was a District Attorney and a state and Federal trial judge in upstate New York before President Reagan chose him for a Federal appeals court seat in 1985 While he is said to be a conservative and is recommended as a possible nominee by Bruce Fein a Heritage Foundation legal expert and former Administration official several legal experts said today that they knew of little to indicate what kind of Supeme Court Justice he would be Obscurity May Be Blessing Some officials are said to see that as one of Judge Miners attractions While he apparently has nothing like Judge Borks passionate support on the right he is less likely to encounter passionate opposition Judge Wallace 58 another conservative who has made a point of advocating judicial deference to elected lawmakers has been considered by Republican Presidents for Supreme Court vacancies as long ago as 1975 He was said to be a favorite of Warren E Burger the retired Chief Justice A Mormon he has attracted attention with statements such as his assertion that the Bible gives great scriptural support for the death penalty and his suggestion that church and state need not be strictly separated Administration officials and others say Judge Wallace has long given the appearance of campaigning actively for a seat on the Supreme Court to a point that some including Mr Fein consider too aggressive Ambassador and Jurist Judge Silberman 51 was Deputy Attorney General and Ambassador to Yugoslavia under Presidents Nixon and Ford He was named by President Reagan to the appeals court here in 1985 and is a man of strong opinions Judge Bowman 53 a former law school dean appointed to his appeals court seat in 1983 is little known here but has attracted favorable notice from Justice Department conservatives While as many as 30 people have been mentioned as possible nominees several who seemed to be leading candidates seem less likely now The include Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah a Republican conservative who would have confirmation problems because of a clause in the Constitution barring appointment of any member of Congress to any office the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during his term and Federal appellate judge Richard A Posner of Chicago a prolific conservative scholar
"THE NATION; Battered But Still Swinging, Reagan Enters Final Rounds",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/weekinreview/the-nation-battered-but-still-swinging-reagan-enters-final-rounds.html,This opening was particularly important because the President has tried vainly for almost seven years to persuade Congress to enact his views on such social issues as abortion and school prayer Mr Reagan saw Judge Bork as a justice who would push the Court toward positions that Congress had repeatedly rejected If as expected the full Senate votes down Judge Borks nomination it will be in part a repudiation of that social agenda As Senator George J Mitchell a Maine Democrat put it when he announced his opposition to the judge The American people agree with the Supreme Court They dont agree with Judge Bork Or he might have added with President Reagan The Inevitable Loss of Power Any President entering the final two years of his second term is at a severe disadvantage the 22d Amendment which bars him from running again guarantees a gradual loss of influence The same holds true for any President who announces his retirement After Lyndon B Johnson decided in March 1968 that he would not seek reelection that November Chief Justice Earl Warren retired Mr Johnson lacked the political power to push through his choice to replace Mr Warren Justice Abe Fortas in the face of a filibuster by conservative senators who railed against the liberal Warren Court questioned Mr Fortass integrity  and asserted that Mr Johnsons successor should be the one to fill the vacancy By STEVEN V ROBERTS WASHINGTON THE cry that President Reagan is now incontrovertibly a lameduck President grew louder last week as the odds grew longer against the Senates voting to confirm Judge Robert H Bork for the Supreme Court Mr Bork vowed Friday to force a vote on the Senate floor though he said he had no illusions about the outcome He had been assessed and treated like a political candidate he complained and would stay the course to discourage public campaigns of distortion in the future President Reagan called the judges opponents a lynch mob Conservative Republicans urged Mr Bork to go forward in the belief that the voters would eventually punish senators who went on record against him But a majority of the Senate had declared opposition to the judge and even his supporters agreed there was virtually no chance of confirmation Mr Borks experience is another measure of how far Mr Reagans political powers have slipped since the days when Congress cowered at the thought of his going on television and stirring up his supporters Unless against all expectations he wins the Bork battle emboldened lawmakers may now try to challenge Mr Reagan more directly on such issues as arms control aid to the contra rebels and trade and budget matters The White House insists that the wound inflicted by the battle will not be fatal We still have more things to do that the President feels strongly about said one senior Presidential aide Well win some and well lose some For one thing of course a Senate vote against Mr Bork does not obliterate Mr Reagans right to name a replacement for Justice Lewis F Powell the crucial swing vote on the High Court  and that choice will undoubtedly be a conservative Moreover despite a cacophony of Congressional criticism it is Mr Reagans policy that is being carried out in the Persian Gulf While the Senate Judiciary Committee was blocking Judge Bork the Congress was failing to pass legislation that would restrict Mr Reagans freedom of action in the gulf In addition a President automatically commands an extra measure of support when dealing with the Soviet Union and Washington and Moscow should soon put the final touches on an agreement banning all intermediaterange missiles That agreement likely to be signed at a summit meeting later this year could help refurbish Mr Reagans reputation as a leader But for months the White House has described the Bork nomination as Mr Reagans top domestic priority and as a pivotal test of strength In August one senior official said the selection of Judge Bork reflects more than anything else the Presidents personal priorities Another aide said This is one you dont want to lose The President has long stressed the importance of the Supreme Courts role and criticized many of its decisions as too liberal When Justice Powell decided to retire last June he handed Mr Reagan a priceless opportunity to tip the bench to the right This opening was particularly important because the President has tried vainly for almost seven years to persuade Congress to enact his views on such social issues as abortion and school prayer Mr Reagan saw Judge Bork as a justice who would push the Court toward positions that Congress had repeatedly rejected If as expected the full Senate votes down Judge Borks nomination it will be in part a repudiation of that social agenda As Senator George J Mitchell a Maine Democrat put it when he announced his opposition to the judge The American people agree with the Supreme Court They dont agree with Judge Bork Or he might have added with President Reagan Like Sand Clout Runs Away Any President entering the final two years of his second term is at a severe disadvantage the 22d Amendment which bars him from running again guarantees a gradual loss of influence The same holds true for any President who announces his retirement After Lyndon B Johnson decided in March 1968 that he would not seek reelection that November Chief Justice Earl Warren retired Mr Johnson lacked the political power to push through his choice to replace Mr Warren Justice Abe Fortas in the face of a filibuster by conservative senators who railed against the liberal Warren Court questioned Mr Fortass integrity  and asserted that Mr Johnsons successor should be the one to fill the vacancy Mr Reagans problems in this regard have been compounded by the results of the 1986 elections and the tenacityof his opponents Two years ago Senate Democrats and their liberal allies started developing a strategy to oppose any Supreme Court nomination and after trying it out on several lower court nominees the opponents were in fighting trim when Judge Bork was nominated As the 1986 elections approached both parties said that the biggest issue was how the Congress would deal with a possible Supreme Court nominee As Mr Reagan roamed the country last fall urging the retention of a Republican Senate he frequently mentioned the importance of the Court But when the Democrats won a majority they felt they had a mandate to oppose many of Mr Reagans policies and when the Administration was further crippled by the lingering effects of the Irancontra affair the Presidents rivals smelled blood Mr Reagan acted as if the elections had not happened He vetoed the Clean Water Bill and was quickly overridden Then he rejected the highway bill and was deeply embarrassed when 13 Republican senators resisted his personal appeal to uphold that veto Since then Congress has brushed aside his objections to a budget a trade bill and a variety of arms control issues But the President still has the veto and that means he cannot be ignored During the final 15 months of the Reagan Presidency Washington is likely to be ruled by what amounts to a coalition government  a Republican President and a Democratic Congress each with the power to check the other The question is whether they will be able to agree on compromise policies or whether deadlock will persist until a new President takes office
'NOBODY LEAVES THE CHURCH',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/books/nobody-leaves-the-church.html,ONCE A CATHOLIC Prominent Catholics and ExCatholics Reveal the Influence of the Church on Their Lives and Work By Peter Occhiogrosso 371 pp Boston Houghton Mifflin Company 1895 EUGENE McCARTHY perhaps the only former United States Senator to write a poem about Fawn Halls antinomian tendencies may be a clever fellow but for better or worse he comes equipped for life with the basic Catholic brain At least Wilfrid Sheed seems to think so In Once a Catholic Peter Occhiogrossos arresting collection of 25 interviews with current and former Roman Catholics Mr Sheed argues that the church somehow instills a doublebarreled message on human value Nobody is altogether worthless to us and that shows up in ones work But with it goes a sense that nobodys that great either that human greatness is probably a deception    Gene McCarthy was a practitioner of the attitude Dont take yourself too seriously jump on anyone who does and be absolutely merciless to anyones pretensions    That was the Catholic upbringing You could be very vain indeed as Senator McCarthy also demonstrated but you couldnt quite make egomaniac Once a Catholic has much to say about the Catholic mind including its penchant for substance over procedure the social over the personal Perhaps only a Catholic would criticize the last few First Ladies as Mr McCarthy does here for picking charities that deal with individual defects such as drug abuse and mental retardation rather than social problems At least Eleanor Roosevelt went into the coal fields he says The famous Catholic impatience with the language of abstract rights is also on display Daniel Callahan head of the Hastings Center on bioethics hectors his prochoice allies the right to an abortion is not the end of the matter how should women normally decide whether to abort Mr Occhiogrosso a freelance writer approached 50 or more potential interviewees for the book and found that female older and conservative Catholics were the hardest to corral The actors Jon Voight and Jack Lemmon turned him down quickly Mary Cunningham the former Bendix executive backed out when the publisher could not assure her in writing that the news media would not perceive the book as critical of the church Mr Occhiogrosso spent an hour talking to Murray Kempton before learning that the brilliant rococo journalist although undeniably a great interview is Episcopalian Perhaps predictably celebrities added for marquee value turn out to be the least interesting George Carlin has nothing much to say Bob Guccione rattles on embarrassingly about how much he respects women even nuns who he devoutly wishes would return to their natural state of being dressed as penguins Jimmy Breslin who once appeared in television commercials to plug a good drinking beer thanks the church for teaching him grammar On the other hand Mr Breslin is happy to hymn the refrain of the books title Let a guy have one chest pain one twinge in the chest and he goes flying back to the things that he was taught in third or fourth grade Nobody leaves the Catholic Church A surprising number of those interviewed wanted to talk about the loss of the Latin mass Like most pageants mounted by the bookish the new vernacular mass turned out rather badly in language tone and staging The artist Thomas LaniganSchmidt complains They wanted to make it conceptual instead of an experience Its a theory Mass now Michael Novak says Now we endure the Liturgy of Happy Talk and Forced Cheerfulness Mr Novak even finds a dollop of de facto ageism in the reform a folk mass can be moving in a small room full of college students but its very hard to live on when youre fifty All this may pass but at the moment it breeds great nostalgia for the mass that bored so many Catholics in the first place As Mary Gordon says Better to get stuck in the thirteenth century than in 1965 better to get stuck in Pange Lingua than Blowin in the Wind  But she admits to some ambivalence The trouble with the Church now is that anybody who wants to retain the old ritual also seems to want to invade El Salvador Divisions among women are familiar those on the left are feminist those on the right sound like religious Total Women Joan Chittister an imposing Benedictine nun complains that if women seem to be barred from the priesthood because everyone at the Last Supper was male then the church should logically withhold communion from all women on the same grounds The problem with the role of women she says is that a very bad biology has been theologized Marlene Elwell Midwestern coordinator for the Rev Pat Robertsons Presidential campaign is an untypical righttolifer She rails against the relativism creeping into parochial schools for instance lesbianism being taught as a lifestyle choice by her local nuns but thanks the Second Vatican Council for teaching her that God is love not the remote divine judge she had been raised to fear As a charismatic she is considered an odd duck within her own church as well as among Protestant evangelicals particularly Southerners who thought Catholics had two heads As a foe of capital punishment she lectures Mr Robertson and his followers on Jesus admonition against judging I will not take responsibility to take someones life    Id rather pay my taxes to support him in his cell hoping hell have a conversion As if to echo Mr Sheeds point about Catholics and human worth she says God loves the murderer and the rapist as much as He loves you youre no better Thats hard to accept but with our Catholic background we believe that Enrique Fernandez a CubanAmerican writer talks about the impact of the churchs teaching that sexual thoughts can be mortal sins The upshot he says is that little boys everywhere are gambling their immortal souls every time sexual awareness rises in the brain Its a very sexy game that you play all by yourself And whats at stake is eternity is everything The notsohidden message is that sex is dangerous and heaven is a sweepstakes prize all too often won by debauched folk with a great sense of timing about deathbed confessions CHRISTOPHER DURANG author of Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You insists he was not angry at the church until he felt the reaction to his play Here he offers bitter comments on Joe McCarthy dogmatism the doctrine of limbo and the belief that masturbation is a mortal sin Eichmann would go to hell and a child who masturbates would go to hell he says Maybe hells a little worse for Eichmann but even so    Christopher Buckley says he was brought back to the church by a brief and wary conversation with a distraught man in the mens room of a hotel in Canada The man was a defrocked Benedictine monk who had no idea what to do or where to go Mr Occhiogrosso wisely makes no attempt to separate practicing Catholics from exbelievers and semibelievers Some people are not quite sure whether they are in the church or out Im still practicing Catholicism Ms Gordon says but Im not sure that the Pope thinks I am More ominously for the Vatican some speak in new tones the church is the people of God and it has an institution which occasionally goes astray and must be brought back into line Robert Hoyt founding editor of the National Catholic Reporter criticizes Mr Callahan for leaving the church Yes the church engages in repression he says and it is wrong about papal infallibility and the denial of power to women but quitting is giving away the ball game
NOTES OF A NAG AND A ROISTERER,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/books/notes-of-a-nag-and-a-roisterer.html,THE MADWOMANS UNDERCLOTHES Essays and Occasional Writings By Germaine Greer 305 pp New York The Atlantic Monthly Press 1795 GERMAINE GREER has never truly been a writer Her spirit has illuminated her written word as if the very act of expressing herself were but a brief rushed gatheringup of her living She is perhaps one of the marvelous letter writers of an age that no longer trifles with them much Her essays columns and books  transcripts as they are of a heroic heart and intellect  seem to have been dashed off in the fire and dispatched to her many sisters Feminism as a literary family To come unawares upon The Madwomans Underclothes a collection of her essays from 1968 to 1985 is to intrude unexpectedly into anothers family reunion All those private jokes shared memories intimate confidences demands and contradictions a noisy emotional overbearing lusty family loving and cursing across the dinner table Incomprehensible or simply an embarrassment to those who are not of it and hungering for its warmth It is not after all the madwomans collection of hats that is at stake here but her underclothes In Australia Ms Greer has said elsewhere if you leave your room in a terrible mess your mother says Look at this room    its like a madwomans underclothes  The journey of womans life defies order and good taste  if she is lucky It is not possible in short to read these essays dispassionately to approach this as a book per se Here are our history our gladdened days our shame and disappointments Germaine Greer is nearing 50 now She lives in a farmhouse in the English countryside rain boots by the back door everything windweathered and drizzlegray Her public and youthful randiness settled into bigheartedness perhaps This collection  arbitrary quixotic untidy starts when Germaine Greer was a lecturer in English at Warwick University a dull and worthy town a good third choice for the best undergraduates She was Australian  a synonym then in middleclass primlipped parlors for being brash vulgar easy Being an outsider gave her freedom however She wrote largely unpaid for Oz as in Ozzie Aussie Australian an underground paper in England that was then being prosecuted under the obscenity laws and became a famous counterculture rallying point In 1970 came The Female Eunuch  denouncing the image of woman unable to love only to bargain worship or be worshipped an object a sexual marionette It was a clarion call and was followed by the debates in New Yorks Town Hall with Norman Mailer much of the tension of which we see now in wiser days hinged on her sexuality It mattered that she was so desirable he so used to desiring There were many such battles over the years most of which are chronicled here about abortion rape pornography seduction as a fourletter word She wrote for The Sunday Times of London at its most trendy before Rupert Murdoch There was most of the time a sexual roistering to her writing But also appropos of abortion The compelled mother loves her child as the caged bird sings The song does not justify the cage nor the love the enforcement Her strengths and weaknesses successes and failures are all here they are the human stumblings of feminism itself wanting it all while wanting none of it There was the lure of becoming a celebrity a television personality a pop expert and thereby colluding with the censors about The Acceptable The Sunday Times in the end started to spike her riskier more controversial columns She was a nag when she was meant to amuse She still is Fortunately It is hard to quote much of her early writing here her usual expletives could hardly be Acceptable It is the language not of the family breakfast table but of the womens baths In truth much of her early writing is also irritating How innocent it seems now gamboling over naked bodies and others beds How irrelevant after AIDS how childish after Chernobyl UNLIKE most collections of journalism it is the later writing that is the finer Here is what she did not grow into a whiner or wimp embittered tired smug or even very rational a point with which she might disagree She as others in the end turned to embrace the wider world Vietnam briefly but later Brazil Ethiopia drawn by disgust at the media binge on pictures of the dead and dying It will be said of course that she is politically naive The Cubans are involved after all in a much bigger adventure than sex speed and smack could possibly supply Their morale is towering But at heart she is on the side of neither regimes nor ideology but of individuals The best essay of all describes in the long introduction her time in a poor village in the south of Italy Mariuzz her 8yearold escort Rosetta the young unmarried woman waiting for marriage the Mafiosi bombing the fish Not a word of invective and each word convincing The Madwomans Underclothes like the feminist movement is nevertheless about being white middleclass and welleducated The empathy with those who are poor black brown in terror or dying is in the end that of a traveler from another bountiful land We cannot help it It is the condition of privilege At least let it be said that Ms Greer is not afraid to look to care Poverty hunger oppression despair here is Deaths dominion And to attack Germaine Greer would be to betray ones own to the enemy
"D'Amato, Uncommitted, Is Senator in the Middle",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/d-amato-uncommitted-is-senator-in-the-middle.html,Senator Alfonse M DAmato flanked by much of New Yorks black political establishment sat on the dais and listened as Don King the boxing promoter spoke It was the Bessie Smith Democratic Clubs annual awards luncheon on Saturday and Mr King the moderator for the affair had only one request for the Republican Senator vote against confirming Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court Mr DAmato is among a dwindling number of Senators who still have not taken a public stance on Judge Bork As such he is being watched keenly by an Administration that has consistently been able to count on his support and by Bork opponents like the 700 black Democrats filling the Sheraton Centre ballroom in Manhattan on Saturday Senator in the Middle The Senator a conservative Republican has made no secret of his discomfort with the prospect of voting on Judge Bork He has criticized the judges decision to remain a candidate in the face of all but certain defeat in the Senate And along with other Republican Senators whose support of a Reagan judicial nominee would ordinarily be automatic he is said to have complained to the White House that the Administration should not force him to choose between deserting the President and casting a vote that could be politically damaging at home From the perspective of a pragmatic politician which Senator DAmato certainly is a vote for Bork is a loser it would please the conservative Republicans who support Mr DAmato anyway and could alienate Democrats who dominate New York politics and whose votes helped make possible the Senators landslide reelection victory last year Silence Viewed as Victory On the podium at the Democratic luncheon Mr DAmato merely smiled and pumped hands He made no mention of Judge Bork but his silence was viewed as a victory For DAmato to be undecided at this point should worry Ronald Reagan more than it worries us said the Rev Al Sharpton a Brooklyn minister who has been been vocal on political and racial issues While Mr DAmatos public neutrality on the Bork nomination pleased some Bork opponents it angered others Were more than a little humiliated that one of our Senators is one of the last to come forward on this said Arlene Swartz executive director of the New York State chapter of the National Abortion Rights League a group that opposes the Bork nomination What Is He Worried About She said her group sought unsuccesfully for weeks to get an audience with Mr DAmato but bumped into Mr DAmato on a trip to Washington The Senator reiterated that he had not yet made up his mind about Judge Bork an answer that Ms Swartz found unsatisfactory I think he is hoping against hope that the whole Bork issue is dead and he could avoid it Ms Swartz said I think hes underestimated the number of New Yorkers that are opposed to Bork Some Administration officials have also voiced displeasure at Mr DAmatos uncommitted stance viewing it as a cynical attempt to avoid alienating his constituents Hes got five years before he stands for reelection so what is he worried about a senior official complained What Mama Used to Say But it was not until last Monday when by most accounts Judge Borks prospects for a seat on the Court were virtually nil that Mr DAmato received a personal plea from the President Groups opposed to the Bork nomination have been scrambling for weeks to swing Mr DAmato around to their view an effort that has intensified as they sensed he was amenable to persuasion Mr DAmato acknowledged that his uncommitted stance has placed him in a political quandary that leaves his motives open to question Mama used to say sometimes its better to just sit back and watch Mr DAmato said Thats what Im doing
Who Torpedoed Judge Bork?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/13/opinion/who-torpedoed-judge-bork.html,Robert Bork is an honorable man with an impressive record as a professor lawyer and judge on the United States Court of Appeals Yet a Senate majority seems lined up against his nomination to be a Supreme Court Justice Why Judge Bork angrily blames a campaign of sordid distortion of his positions He wants to strike a blow against such campaigns and thus insists on pressing his case to a final floor vote Judge Bork is surely entitled to an upordown decision There have been distortions of his positions the broad battle over his nomination has at times been reduced to slogans But even if unfair politicking contributed to his apparent inevitable defeat dwelling on that sweeps aside a more obvious and more powerful explanation the unacceptability of his constitutional views Judge Bork had a Judiciary Committee hearing of unprecedented care and thoroughness and a fair chance to answer every criticism The moderate Senators who made the difference heard 12 days of testimony A resounding 9to5 majority voted no Robert Bork wants to be a Supreme Court Justice But the record shows he has a strange idea of what justice is The narrator of the television ad is Gregory Peck He defended poll taxes and literacy tests which kept many Americans from voting He opposed the civil rights law that ended whites only signs at lunch counters He doesnt believe the Constitution protects your right to privacy And he thinks that freedom of speech does not apply to literature and art and music    Is this 60second TV spot fair debate The nominee apparently feels strongly that it is not Without identifying detractors he thinks have been unfair he angrily complains that the facts of my professional life have been misrepresented And he denounces the use of the tactics and techniques of national political campaigns in a confirmation fight The Peck TV spot to take an example is a mixture of exaggeration understatement and fair debate Judge Bork did not defend poll taxes or literacy tests as the Senate well knows Senators are disturbed however that he criticized Supreme Court decisions holding that Congress had the power to strike them down But he did oppose the law that desegregated lunch counters  calling its principle one of unsurpassed ugliness He doesnt deny that the Constitution protects some privacy values but he criticized Supreme Court decisions striking down state laws against contraception and abortion He has amended his views of freedom of speech but Senators worry about the depth of his conversion Why does a Senate majority oppose Judge Borks elevation An important reason is the 1986 election President Reagan campaigned for a Republican Senate that would confirm his judges the voters gave control to the Democrats The lobbying and advertising campaign was another reason But above all rose the merits of the Bork nomination as ventilated in fair exhaustive sometimes brilliant hearings Far from settling the doubts of moderate Senators these created new ones for one Senator after another Whether or not one is comfortable with TV spots about the Supreme Court to blame them for Judge Borks evident fate confuses supposedly low blows with demonstrably hard ones
"Pledging Tolerance, Bush Officially Joins 1988 Race",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/13/us/pledging-tolerance-bush-officially-joins-1988-race.html,Vice President Bush formally began his second quest for the Presidency today setting a tone of moderation and pledging to stand for a new harmony and a greater tolerance A President must never intrude but a President can set a tone an atmosphere a mood Mr Bush said in his announcement speech I mean to stand for a new harmony a greater tolerance and a renewed recognition that this country is and always has been a partnership We need a new harmony too among the races in our country he told a predominantly white audience of Texans The sadness of racial tensions in America should have ended completely by now We are on a journey to a new century and we must finally leave the tired old baggage of bigotry behind us Confident and Buoyant Mr Bush who was born in Connecticut made his announcement in his adopted home state as he embarked on a sevenday crosscountry swing On his way here from Washington the candidate said Ive never felt stronger but time will tell Amid a festive election night environment Mr Bush was introduced by former Senator John G Tower a Texas Republican who hailed the Vice President as a leader with background and experience who is one of us Mr Bush dressed in a dark blue pinstriped suit and surrounded by his wife Barbara and other family members seemed buoyant At a rally later where handpainted Go for It George banners were displayed he confidently proclaimed I am going to be the next President of the United States Mr Bush the leading contender for the Republican nomination has made loyalty to President Reagan the guiding principle of his sevenyear tenure as Vice President Although his speech today indicated some disagreement with Reagan policies it was more of a shift in tone than in substance Education and Environment On the issues of financing for education and protecting the environment he openly disagreed with Mr Reagan He called for the Federal Government to spend more on education without saying how much Regarding the environment he said I dont think weve done enough to protect it these past dozen years of so I dont think weve given the land its due Mr Bush also indirectly criticized current and former Reagan Administration officials who have been accused of improprieties Without naming the officials he assailed what he called influence peddling in Washington as shameful But his tone made it clear that these were small steps away from Mr Reagan And he said at the start of his speech that we dont need radical new directions  we need strong and steady leadership Still the speech underscored the perception of some conservatives that Mr Bush lacks the same commitment to their cause as Mr Reagan For example it avoided mention of some key conservative priorities of recent years including a constitutional amendment to ban abortion It also omitted any reference to the difficulties of Judge Robert H Bork whose Supreme Court nomination Mr Bush had vowed to fight for just last week George Bush as George Bush The announcement speech written by Peggy Noonan a former White House speechwriter emphasized the core of the Vice Presidents campaign strategy Although not distancing himself from the President who is still popular among Republican activists Mr Bush tried to present his own political platform You can characterize this as a subtle shift or as a dramatic shift but this is the beginning of George Bush as George Bush said Richard N Bond his political director and deputy campaign manager Endorsing many of the more confrontational policies of the President Mr Bush vowed not to raise taxes but to continue support for the Nicaraguan insurgents and for rebels in other countries he said were fighting for democracy We must be true to the knowledge that the interests of the world are best served  and the cause of peace best served  by not merely containing Communism but by spreading freedom he said But reflecting the nature of the speech he left some proposals unexplained For example he said he would not accelerate efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit but he did not indicate whether that would mean reducing military spending or some other measure Taxpayers Bill of Rights Mr Bush also said that if elected he would put the force of my Presidency behind a taxpayers bill of rights that spells out explicitly what the limits of power are for the Internal Revenue Service Mr Bush is seeking to become the first sitting Vice President since Martin Van Buren in 1836 to be elected President and his experience as No 2 is expected to be a key selling point He said today that the election would come down to who is best suited to sit at the Presidential desk one that he has observed for seven years as Vice President I am that man Mr Bush declared Mr Bushs attempt to offer a different emphasis appeared most clearly as he talked about compassion which is of special significance because minority and civil rights groups have said that Reagan Administration policies are devoid of compassion Prosperity with a purpose means in short helping your brothers and sisters whoever they are whatever their needs Mr Bush said We Are the Party of Lincoln There are those who would say its soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things But where is it written that Republicans must act as if they do not care as if they are not moved I say to my fellow Republicans We are the party of Lincoln Our whole history was protecting those who needed our protection and making this a kinder nation Mr Bush also struck less of a hardline chord as he expressed support for an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union to eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles He said the issue of peace was one that overwhelms other domestic concerns But reflecting the concern of some his opponents and party conservatives that such an agreement might be shortsighted Mr Bush said that a prudent skepticism was necessary for dealing with Moscow And what is the proper attitude toward the Soviets as we pursue progress he said Praise God and keep your guard up The announcement in Texas a state critical to the Vice Presidents election hopes was a reminder of the geographical and political confusion that has lingered around Mr Bush A Career in the Oil Fields The son of Prescott Bush a United States Senator from Connecticut the Vice President has called Texas home since moving there from Connecticut nearly 40 years ago to begin what became a career in the Texas oil fields Mr Bush was twice elected to Congress from Texass Seventh District and twice he unsuccessfully sought election to the Senate Mr Bush who has been called a resume candidate by some opponents has also held a variety of highranking appointed positions  experience that he is expected to stress in the campaign They include the post of United States ambassador to the United Nations chairman of the Republican National Committee chief of the United States liaison office in China and Director of Central Intelligence Unlike his first bid in 1980 when Mr Bush began

"High Tide for Conservatives, But Some Fear What Follows",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/13/us/high-tide-for-conservatives-but-some-fear-what-follows.html,The American conservative movement which by many measures is more powerful than it has ever been is going through a season of frustration division and discontent As many conservative ideas have come to be accepted in mainstream American thought conservatives find themselves on the political defensive on many fronts some in near despair over Judge Robert H Borks imperiled Supreme Court nomination and deeply divided over who should carry the standard of the coalition that Ronald Reagan helped build At the same time that coalition is straining under the weight of the contradictions inherent in any broadbased political alliance Many fault lines are visible the religious conservatives against freespirited libertarians supplysiders against the fiscally orthodox longtime movement loyalists against more recent converts Such differences are inherent in the diverse intellectual impulses that came together in the 1950s in the modern conservative movement fierce antiCommunism in foreign policy a reverence for tradition  often religious tradition and devotion to unfettered capitalism Predicting a Crackup The view that conservatives are in trouble comes not from hopeful liberals but from fretful conservatives At their most alarmed they fear they are witnessing what R Emmett Tyrrell Jr a conservative editor and columnist has called the coming conservative crackup Mr Tyrrell devoted part of a recent issue of his influential conservative magazine The American Spectator to just that subject Kevin Phillips the conservative analyst who predicted the rise of a Republican majority nearly two decades ago now sees a strong possibility of Republican  and conservative  decline Among the causes of the conservative unease are divisions in the movement on specific issues such as the evolving agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate medium and shorterrange missiles In criticizing the treaty and tangling with Vice President Bush over his support for the pact many veterans of the conservative cause  including Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Jack Kemp  find themselves in the odd position of opposing President Reagan on what he hopes will be one of the most important achievements of his Presidency Disputes on the Basics Some libertarians who prize individual liberty above all else and often disagree with the religious right opposed Judge Borks nomination  though they were in a minority in the movement Often however the disputes are at a more fundamental level over the movements longterm goals as when conservatives differed among themselves on whether the Reagan Administration was right in its early years to emphasize its taxcutting agenda over such social issues as prayer in schools and limitations on abortion For more optimistic conservatives the ferment within the movement is a sign of how broad and healthy the movement has become George Nash the author of The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945 a book many conservatives regard as the definitive intellectual history of their cause notes that never before have there been so many conservative think tanks and foundations so many conservative political operatives and respected intellectuals Telling History to Stop Mr Nash said that in the 1950s conservatives saw themselves as a minority standing athwart history and yelling Stop  The phrase from the first issue of The National Review the movements major journal captured the view of the movements intellectual founders  people like William F Buckley Jr and one of Mr Buckleys ideological mentors Frank Meyer that American conservatives were a beleaguered remnant battling at the margins against a well entrenched Liberal Establishment Now such thoughts seem out of place Largely because Mr Reagans political victories have conferred legitimacy on the movement conservatives are very much in the American mainstream He has made the conservative end of the sprectrum part of the public policy debate Mr Nash said of Mr Reagan Its not now thought of as bizarre and beyond the realm of legitimate discourse Differences on Legacy Conservatisms victories on the intellectual front are substantial and include a wider acceptance of the benefit of unfettered market forces and a greater skepticism about sexual and educational experimentation There is disagreement however over which parts of the Reagan legacy are enduring Within such disagreements Mr Nash fears lies a danger of deep sectarian division among proponents of the modern conservative movements basic impulses For conservatives of a libertarian bent it is the free market aspect of Reaganism that will last This argument was presented forcefully by Paul H Weaver a journalist and intellectual at a recent conference sponsored by the CATO Institute a libertarian research organization After seven years of Reagan Mr Weaver said public mistrust of big government remains intense deregulation continues tax cutting and loophole closing retain their public appeal privatization is still the wave of the future and the strength and influence of markets continues to grow Some Signs May Mislead On the other hand Mr Weaver argued cultural conservatism is in disarray Despite Pat Robertsons showings in the polls he said the morass into which the Bork nomination has run shows that traditional morality and the neotheocratic element of Reaganism have little staying power on the national stage But others dispute that view citing a wider acceptance of traditional values Such conservatives see an important shift in their direction in the new awareness even among liberals and feminists of the need to promote stable family lives and of the popularity of the backtobasics movement in education Both of these movements they argue represent a backlash against the experimentation of the 1960s There are other divisions among conservatives On economics for example Senator Bob Dole of Kansas speaks for the fiscally orthodox when he warns about the dangers of the budget deficit supplysiders like Mr Kemp play down the deficits importance as compared with the need to avoid any tax increases Old Clashes With New And last year there was a vigorous polemic between oldtime conservatives led by such figures as Prof Melvin Bradford of the University of Dallas and neoconservatives like Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz Professor Bradford and his allies argued that the neoconservatives who are mainly former Democrats were importing liberal ideas into the conservative movement and seeking to transform conservatism into something quite different a kind of 1940s antiCommunist liberalism more suitable to Harry S Truman than to Robert Taft or Barry Goldwater What alarms conservatives is that the division among its intellectuals may reflect cracks in their electoral coalition They saw warning signs in the 1986 elections when the Democrats retook control of the Senate and won back votes from crucial swing groups that had helped build the Reagan majority Workingclass whites in the North and poorer whites in the South who had been attracted to Mr Reagans traditionalist social agenda returned to the Democrats in substantial numbers No More Flags on Jeans Mr Phillips the voting analyst said that as many Democratic candidates cut away from the countercultural themes of the 1960s  Democrats stopped wearing blue jeans with American flags sewn on their seats he said  the party made it easier for traditional Democrats to vote their economic interests But the Democrats also picked up votes in 1986 from socially liberal and betteroff groups who had been attracted by Mr Reagans economic conservatism but turned off by his social agenda Such voters were especially worried about the conservative movements opposition to abortion rights and what they saw as the alarming influence of the religious right in the Republican Party The conservatives main worry is that their causes fractious intellectual wings and its unstable electoral alliance may not hold together in the absence of Ronald Reagans personal appeal Without a single unifying leader said John Buckley press secretary to Mr Kemp the movement is not only Balkanized but ends up imploding because of the various inconsistencies within it Aging Coalition Is Perceived Mr Phillips sees the decline of conservatism in historical terms He argues that the Reagan Presidency marked not the beginning but the end of a period of conservative ascendancy The coalition assembled behind Mr Reagan Mr Phillips says was created not in 1980 by Mr Reagan but in the 1960s by Barry Goldwater and Richard M Nixon The Reagan alliance of the 1980s is really an aging coalition of traditional Republicans and those Democrats who were sympathetic to former Gov George C Wallace of Alabama in the 1960s Mr Phillips believes that the free market impulse will give way to demands for more government action in the 1990s as the United States confronts increasingly fierce economic competition around the world Despite their fears for their movement both Mr Nash and Mr Tyrrell argue that such obituaries for conservatism are premature Mr Tyrrell says that conservatism has faced similar intellectual splits since the 1950s without much apparent harm to the cause And he says that divisions in the enemy liberal camp could yet save the movement from its current malaise But for the moment said Mr Nash there is no doubt that recent political developments including Judge Borks troubles have sent a chill through the conservative ranks
Catholic Bishops Take Stand on '88 Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/15/us/catholic-bishops-take-stand-on-88-issues.html,The nations Roman Catholic bishops declared today that they will stake out strong positions in the 1988 election campaign endorsing no candidates but stating clearly where they stand on issues The bishops some of whom were criticized for objecting to specific candidates positions on abortion in 1984 said church efforts in public affairs unfortunately are sometimes misunderstood We bishops specifically do not seek the formation of a religious voting bloc nor do we wish to instruct persons on how they should vote by endorsing or opposiing candidates the Catholic leaders said We do however have a right and a responsibility as teachers to analyze the moral dimensions of the major issues of our day We urge citizens to avoid choosing candidates simply on the basis of narrow selfinterest The 23page statement approved last month by the United States Catholic Conferences administrative board made up of nearly 50 bishops mentioned no political party by name But many of the positions including those on economic rights and Central America are closer to the Democratic Partys general views while the traditional church position on abortion is closer to the general stance taken by many Republicans Among other things it calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortions says the Government should support realistic peace plans in regiional conflicts such as Nicaragua calls for negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty opposes the death penalty and seeks a higher minimum wage and special jobcreation programs The Roman Catholic Church is the nations largest religious denomination with 529 million members

Books of the Times; Reflections on Science,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/17/books/books-of-the-times-reflections-on-science.html,AN URCHIN IN THE STORM Essays about Books and Ideas By Stephen Jay Gould 255 pages WW Norton and Company 1895 In this climate beleaguered rationalism needs its skilled debaters writers who can combine wit penetrating analysis sharp prose and sweet reason into an expansive view that expunges nonsense without stifling innovation and that presents the excitement and humanity of science in a positive way Those words from Stephen Jay Goulds latest collection of pieces occur in an essay about the writer Martin Gardner but they perfectly describe Mr Goulds own incisive work Mr Gould teaches biology geology and the history of science at Harvard and on the evidence of his columns for Natural History magazine collected in three absorbing volumes Ever Since Darwin The Pandas Thumb and Hens Teeth and Horses Toes and this new volume of essays he must be a wonderful teacher  not merely an eloquent scientist but also a philosopher and polymath whos as likely in his lectures to draw upon the works of Voltaire Alexander Pope Frank Capra and Groucho Marx as on the theories of Darwin and Freud His writing is informed of course by the scholars grasp of detail and a professionals appreciation of field work but at the same time it is thoroughly accessible to the layman Such complicated concepts as plate tectonics and biological determinism are patiently explained  often with considerable brio and wit  and pivotal theories are carefully situated within a cultural and social context thereby giving us an understanding of their relationship to the days major currents of thought how for instance Darwin translated Adam Smiths economics into nature as the principle of natural selection and their lasting consequences within the scientific community and beyond Though the pieces in An Urchin in the Storm are technically book reviews Mr Gould tends to use the subject at hand as a jumpingoff point for more general discussions and as he notes in his introduction the essays consequently share a particular view of nature and human life the perspective of an evolutionist committed to understanding the curious pathways of history as irreducible but rationally accessible More general readers may well know Mr Gould as an outspoken proponent of Darwinism and the final essay in Urchin does in fact contain a spirited warning about creationism its exploiters and fundraisers are rightwing evangelicals who advance the literalism of Genesis as just one item in a comprehensive political program that would also ban abortion and return oldfashioned patriarchy under the guise of saving American families Within the scientific community however Mr Gould is perhaps better known for his opposition to the tenets of orthodox Darwinism His theory of punctuated equilibrium stands in opposition to Darwins belief that evolution proceeded slowly and regularly not by fits and starts And he takes issue as well with strict adaptationism a brand of NeoDarwinism that would locate all evolutionary mechanics in the struggle among organisms for reproductive success As Mr Gould sees it such views which would explain every creatures traits strictly in terms of survival or reproduction neglect the important role of contingency in evolution and also diminish the wonderful diversity of the natural world Evolution he writes is the quintessential science of history and the hold of history lies exposed in myriad imperfections and compromises pandas thumbs featured by all organisms as legacies of their different pasts  while Panglossian adaptationism makes history irrelevant For him history is neither a chaos of random happenings nor a pretty ladder neatly culminating in human wisdom Rather it dependson odd particulars quite unpredictable and unrepeatable themselves that divert futures into new channels shallow and adjacent to old pathways at first but deepening and diverging with the passage of time These beliefs in one form or another underlie many of the essays in this volume from a review of a book about pandas in which Mr Gould discusses how they subsist nearly entirely upon bamboo to a series of pieces about biological determinism in which he takes on the theories of Arthur Jensen who argued that the 15 point average difference in IQ scores between blacks and whites must be largely innate in origin and carefully lays bare what he sees as the flawed underpinnings of sociobiology In addition this volume includes a lovely meditation on the nature of geological time and change a compelling account of the 19thcentury Devonian controversy which involved the identification of a major period in earth history and portraits of four eminent biologists Barbara McClintock whose discovery of transposable elements in maize helped revolutionize modern molecular genetics E E Just a black scholar who struggled against the paternalistic racism of the scientific establishment G E Hutchinson whom Mr Gould heralds as the worlds greatest living ecologist and the wellknown writer Lewis Thomas A few of the pieces in Urchin feature passages that seem overly technical  most notably a lengthy discussion of psychometrics and factor analysis as they relate to IQ tests and as a result risk losing the lay readers attention Such lapses however are rare Like the finest of teachers Mr Gould succeeds in these pages in forcing us to reexamine our preconceptions and to marvel again at the manifold complexities of our strange and difficult world
"Joseph Cardinal Hoffner, 80; Led German Catholic Church",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/obituaries/joseph-cardinal-hoffner-80-led-german-catholic-church.html,Joseph Cardinal Hoffner the former head of the Roman Catholic Church in West Germany and a strong supporter of Pope John Paul II died in a Cologne hospital on Friday He was 80 years old A church spokesman said Cardinal Hoffner Archbishop of Cologne died after a long illness caused by a brain tumor The Cardinal asked the Pope in August to relieve him of his post after doctors said his condition was inoperable His successor as head of the West German Catholic Church is Bishop Karl Lehmann of Mainz A conservative Cardinal Hoffner was a strong defender of traditional Catholic moral doctrine He rejected the idea of allowing married men to become priests and opposed permitting divorced and remarried Catholics to take communion He campaigned for a ban on abortion and condemned calls by the antiwar movement for civil disobedience Born in December 1906 to a farming family in the staunchly Catholic Rhineland he studied in Freiburg and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome Ordained a priest in 1932 he taught theology at Trier and Munster Universities before becoming Bishop of Munster in 1962 Pope Paul VI named him Bishop of Cologne in February 1969 and two months later he became a Cardinal He was elected head of the West German Catholic Church in 1976
"TV VIEW; INTIMATIONS OF DISASTER, AND 30-SECOND SOUND BITES",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/arts/tv-view-intimations-of-disaster-and-30-second-sound-bites.html,THERE IS A SENSE THAT SOMEthing is out of hand Is the system working or not Presidential candidates seem to drop like flies while a nomination to the Supreme Court is debated in 30second sound bites We watch we wait Television keeps giving us intimations of disaster That could hurt if not destroy his campaign Ted Koppel said after revelations about Pat Roberston Mike Wallace interviewing Bob Woodward on 60 Minutes began by declaring that William J Casey had died conveniently even some say mysteriously Mr Wallace never alluded again to what seemed to be a suggestion that the former Director of Central Intelligence had been murdered but it hung there like a cloud of swamp gas Perhaps this didnt matter After all whats television all about Increasingly it seems to be a place to confirm our dark forebodings even when it invites us to giggle while we brood Thus we knew it was all over for Gary Hart the night CBS presented a brief film clip that showed Mr Hart on the yacht Monkey Business Only weeks later we saw Senator Joseph R Biden Jr sink on a Thursday night A charge of plagiarism was one thing but watching Senator Biden and Neil Kinnock the leader of the British Labor Party say the same words on the networks and MacNeil Lehrer was something else We were appalled of course yet whos to deny that we werent also amused There is entertainment value on television when a politician falls on his face The problem I think is that we have come to expect this politics on television may not be much fun unless someone does fall on his face A correspondent can help the process along Last Sunday on 60 Minutes Mr Wallace interviewed the Rev Jesse Jackson members of his family and some of his childhood friends The segment for the most part was remarkably favorable to Mr Jackson For one thing his children were enormously attractive Everyone should be so lucky to have a family like that Mr Jacksons media consultants if he has any could not have produced anything that would have made their candidate seem so appealing Toward the end of the segment however while Mr Wallace and Mr Jackson were one on one Mr Wallace mentioned sex money and drugs How would Mr Jackson handle accusations or rumors about them Mr Jackson more or less ignored the question which is what any sensible candidate should do on television We had the feeling though that Mr Wallace was trying to tell us something he seemed to be raising charges without having to take responsibility for raising them On the other hand it may have been only that all happy families resemble one another and that on television a whiff of scandal or a hint of something salacious is just thought to play better Whatever it was an insinuation hung there like more swamp gas The TV argument over the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork has had a swampgas element too On the Friday that Judge Bork announced he would still seek confirmation despite the Senate Judiciary Commitees rejection Nightline conducted a discussion among ABC correspondents Jeff Greenfield said that some of Judge Borks opponents felt uncomfortable and that the argument over confirmation had left a bad taste in peoples mouths Brit Hume declared that some opponents had used distortions Moreover he said the distortions were very effective Coincidentally ABCs World News Tonight that night chose Ralph Neas who had coordinated the antiBork lobby as its Person of the Week In fact much of the lobbying had been conducted on television beginning with a commercial narrated by Gregory Peck Political campaigning and the judges function are incompatible Judge Bork said solemnly when he announced that he would fight for confirmation but that was only for the record The truth was that he was up to his neck in a political campaign and that television which also gave us the Senate hearings live was its principal venue The antiBork people may have had Mr Peck and the TV producer Norman Lear last week Jack Kemp began showing commercials too Mr Kemp who is running for President tied his candidacy to the fate of Judge Bork It is clear that something new is happening in the way we choose Supreme Court Justices This is not healthy Media consultants liberal and conservative work with smart polltakers who have become increasingly sophisticated about measuring our hopes fears and what we worry about at 3 oclock in the morning The game has to do with connecting our feelings with political issues It isnt particularly hard to do this the trick is to keep things simple The most complicated question about constitutional interpretation say can be reduced to a few words and an image Would a Supreme Court nominee really drive women into back alleys for abortions Do his opponents really want to set murderers and rapists free A television commercial can come down on either side and so can political partisans In Judge Borks case we heard some of them in the 30second sound bites But debates conducted this way are cheapened they are carried on not with real coin but with the manipulation of feeling This can be entertaining passion of course can be fun It is pleasing to feel righteous about one cause or another As a way to pick a Supreme Court Justice however the new procedure is deplorable no matter how loudly partisans applaud Will confirmation debates continue this way even into future Administrations The possibility is now open for both Democrats and Republicans to act badly We will all lose if their media consultants win
THE NATION; REAGAN'S HEART WINNING THE BATTLE FOR HIS MIND,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/weekinreview/the-nation-reagan-s-heart-winning-the-battle-for-his-mind.html,LET Reagan Be Reagan has long been the cry of the Presidents conservative supporters But last week in New Jersey there seemed to be two Ronald Reagans addressing the question of the Supreme Court and his apparently doomed nomination of Judge Robert H Bork They took dramatically different tacks Yet both could claim to be the real thing One Reagan delivered a speech to the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce in Somerset that was notable for its moderate tone  and for its difference from an advance text distributed that very morning The earlier version contained the charge that Judge Bork has been the victim of a sophisticated campaign of smears and lies Alarmed that such harsh language could hinder confirmation of the next nominee White House aides rewrote the talk at the last minute As Fred I Greenstein professor of politics at Princeton University noted Hes such a trooper that in one sense the true Ronald Reagan is the one who sticks to the script But later in the day as he finished addressing a Republican fundraiser in Whippany the President let his feelings spill out Urged on by a cheering crowd Mr Reagan adlibbed an ending taunting the Democrats and promising that if he has to name a different Supreme Court Justice Ill try to find one that theyll object to just as much as they did to this one This is the other true Reagan the ideologue said Professor Greenstein a scholar of the Presidency He was flushed out The New Jersey trip was one of several recent occasions when the Presidents comments illuminated an underlying conflict between the counsel of his advisers and his natural instincts Another example involves the Irancontra scandals For months Mr Reagan has been counseled to express regret and to accept the Tower Commissions conclusion that the affair amounted to an armsforhostages trade that never should have happened In a nationally televised address in March Mr Reagan said my heart and my best intentions tell me that the initiative was not a trade for hostages But the facts and the evidence he continued say that it was Nevertheless in an interview with Fred Barnes in The New Republic of Oct 26 Mr Reagan demonstrated that he still trusts his heart The deal he said was not trading arms for hostages and was worth pursuing Its aim the President continued was for the United States to be in a position to influence what kind of a government there would be after the Khomeini That explanation has been abandoned as unconvincing by those who contrived the scheme And then there is the matter of the Federal deficit Late last month Mr Reagan bowed to the urging of his advisers particularly Howard H Baker Jr his chief of staff and agreed to sign a new version of the budgetbalancing law known as GrammRudmanHollings The President despised the bill mainly because it would force him to choose between raising taxes or cutting military spending The measure requires automatic spending cuts half from the Pentagon if Congress and the White House do not agree on how to reduce the deficit to specified levels Indeed the Congressional Budget Office last week issued its estimate of the first round of cuts which will become law next month if the deficit is not otherwise reduced Military spending would come down over 10 percent this year The cut would be diminished by a Democratic plan voted by the House Ways and Means Committee last week for a 123 billion deficitreduction tax increase At the billsigning for the budgetbalancing measure earlier this month Mr Reagan reminded the assembled audience that most Rose Garden ceremonies are happy occasions Then with many lawmakers who crafted the legislation squirming uncomfortably the President added This one is not This is a bill that Ill sign with great reluctance Such incidents indicate that the struggle for the Presidents mind between two camps pragmatists and purists has intensified In the past Mr Reagans superb political skills have often been sufficient to paper over the fissure On controversial social issues such as abortion he has generally heeded the warning of pragamists led in his first term by Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d then White House chief of staff that spending much political capital on them could alienate mainstream voters Meanwhile he has mollified purists led by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d with his determined rhetoric But as the Presidents power dwindles in the last 15 months of his Administration the cracks are showing Howard Baker came into the White House with a reputation as a master compromiser Mr Bakers first months disappointed those in Washington who had hoped for a more conciliatory tone from the Oval Office Now he is pushing harder trying to convince Mr Reagan that in a changing political climate he must be more accommodating That effort was directly reflected in the rewriting of the Tuesday speech The chief of staff did not want irritations in Congress generated by the Bork fight further inflamed The adlib a few hours later showed that deep down the President has not yet accepted the Baker approach
Business and the Law; Speech Rights Of Companies,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/19/business/business-and-the-law-speech-rights-of-companies.html,VIEW the world of corporate law from the perspective of the First Amendment and it could look dramatically different a former senior lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union told an audience of Federal judges and lawyers here last Friday At the annual conference of the Second Judicial Circuit Burt Neuborne who until last year had been the national legal director of the ACLU said that many laws regulating the marketplace probably could be successfully challenged on the ground that they violated the First Amendment In the securities area for instance its about time that the system is regulated in an economically efficient way said Mr Neuborne and the First Amendment would be a good prism through which to look at these issues Mr Neuborne a professor at the New York University School of Law explained that there was no compelling reason for example why statutes had certain specifications for the tombstone advertisements that are placed in newspapers to announce the sale of stocks and bonds Such requirements are almost certainly unconstitutional he said adding that the time has come to challenge the constitutionality of aspects of decades worth of other corporate regulations He also said that unlike political speech the First Amendment did not and should not protect false or misleading statements by businesses One Federal judge in New York who not too long ago ruled in a landmark case involving the constitutionality of a Federal securities law took Mr Neubornes position a step further I dont see any reason why a corporate issuer of securities has to be silent during the period between a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the time in which the sale is approved said the judge in an interview speaking on condition that he not be identified Federal securities laws limit what an issuer of a stock or bond may say between the date the offering is filed with the SEC and the date it becomes effective I think that amounts to an improper prior restraint the judge said Thats not to say that officers shouldnt be punished for committing fraud or being deceptive or something like that But there is a strong tradition in the law that it be used to punish someone after theyve acted wrongly not to chill them beforehand But Kenneth J Bialkin a corporate lawyer at Willkie Farr  Gallagher disagreed He said the limitations before a stock offering were not really restrictions on speech but an effort to prevent the sale of a security before a registration statement with the SEC becomes effective In a direct response to Mr Neuborne Prof Frederick Schauer of the University of Michigan School of Law said that those who advocated the use of the First Amendment in order to deregulate the marketplace might be seriously undermining free expression in other areas Burt wants less paternalism said Mr Schauer and the economic analysts want more of a free market Those views ought to be argued about in the political arena and perhaps under other constitutional provisions I do not see the First Amendment as the appropriate lever for general views about Government regulation If we do use it as that lever we may discover that it snaps The Supreme Court only began shaping the constitutional guidelines on the speech rights of companies about a decade ago during the Burger Court The area has become known as commercial speech and a majority of the cases have concerned the manner in which businesses can advertise The Court has struck down laws restricting advertisements for drugstores lawyers and abortion clinics It has also upheld restrictions on advertisements by casinos in Puerto Rico and a law that required The Pittsburgh Press to print certain classified advertisements Congress is considering measures that would restrict the speech of some companies House and Senate committees have held hearings on proposals to either ban or tax cigarette advertisements At the judicial conference which ended yesterday morning Floyd Abrams the noted First Amendment lawyer at Cahill Gordon  Reindel said that it was only a matter of time before free speech arguments would be used by top corporate officials involved in takeover battles Elections of company leaders like political elections involve some of the most important choices that are made in society said Mr Abrams I think its not too far off to foresee a case in which there is a corporate takeover and one side will claim that the other is providing less than full information and the other side will step up to the plate and say that the SEC has no authority to demand all this information
IN THE NATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/19/opinion/in-the-nation.html,Richard Nixon learned it the hard way in 1960 Hubert Humphrey couldnt avoid it in 1968 Now George Bush is getting a taste of the unpleasant truth its not easy for a sitting vice president to be elected to the White House Not since 1836 in a far different political era has a No 2 man been able to do it Martin Van Buren of whom John Randolph of Roanoke remarked that he rowed to his object with muffled oars Even Walter Mondale who lay low for four years after his Vice Presidency couldnt escape the taint when he became a Presidential nominee in 1984 Voters remembered his role in President Carters unpopular Administration and Mr Mondale paid the price That problem affects any vice president who seeks to move up to the Presidency He cant honorably repudiate the Administration of which he was an official part but he cant make much of a case that in that Administration he was anything but what Nelson Rockefeller once scorned as standby equipment though Mr Rockefeller later accepted the job Thus a vice president campaigning for the Presidency can take little credit for the achievements of the Administration he served but may be held to account by the voters for the failures and follies of that Administration Many of the issues an outgoing President dealt with  or didnt still confront the candidates seeking to succeed him If the President has taken a politically unrewarding position on such an issue or ducked it its hard for his vice president to take a different stance Either he swallows and stands up for a disadvantageous position or he suffers accusations of disloyalty and desertion Finally theres still a President to reckon with a lame duck no doubt but a live person wielding the powers of the office and perhaps still popular His vice president even though campaigning to replace him can offend such a President only at dire political peril Thus in 1960 when Mr Nixon attempted in his Pact of Fifth Avenue with Mr Rockefeller to call for more defense spending than President Eisenhower thought necessary the President forced his Vice President to back down Earlier Mr Eisenhower damaged Mr Nixons claim to vast experience by telling reporters that if you give me a week he might be able to think of an important idea the Vice President had contributed to the Eisenhower Administration Throughout the campaign in which he ultimately lost to John F Kennedy Mr Nixon had little choice but to defend the Administrations apparent unconcern about Fidel Castro  while Mr Kennedy appealed for strong action against Mr Castro In 1968 Hubert Humphrey finally differed with President Johnsons unpopular position on Vietnamese peace negotiations  but not until the Vice Presidents Presidential campaign had been all but mortally wounded by the peace movements shouts of Dump the Hump When Mr Humphrey pleaded with the President to increase farm support prices that fall Mr Johnson refused which Mr Humphrey thought cost him the election That refusal may have resulted from Presidential pique on the Vietnam question Now Mr Bush at last an official Presidential candidate is trying to edge away from the liabilities of the Reagan Administration without treading dangerously on Mr Reagans toes The Vice President said in his formal announcement that he would do more for education and environmental protection spoke approvingly of compassion and inveighed against influence peddling  apparently a euphemism for the high sleaze quotient among Reagan Administration officials Mr Bush also risked his hardwon foothold on the far right by withholding mention of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion But the next day as if to make it clear that he was still on the team Mr Bush defended the proposed arms control treaty and proclaimed himself proudly a part of the Reagan Administration The day after that he borrowed a page from Mr Reagans campaign book with a proposal to cut capital gains taxes Shades of voodoo economics All this fast footwork shows that the Vice President recognizes his problem as a Presidential candidate to prove himself neither a Reagan clone nor a backsliding opportunist But history suggests it will be harder than he may think to do either without doing the other
New York Revamps Social Studies,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/20/nyregion/new-york-revamps-social-studies.html,New York State has begun phasing in a revamped social studies program that stresses 20thcentury American history at the high school level and abandons the topical methods of the 1970s in favor of a more chronological approach The new plan which calls for a global perspective involving more attention to Latin America and other nonEuropean areas also increases the number of social studies courses required for a diploma and for the first time requires students to pass tests in the subject in order to graduate The curriculum is being hailed by many educators who view the deemphasis of European history as fitting for an increasingly diverse student population The emphasis on 20thcentury history they add addresses the perennial complaint of teachers that the school year ends while they are leading students through World War I Students Shortchanged This is no minor issue said Elliot Salow director of social studies for the New York City Board of Education The Vietnamese War to our kids is as remote as the American Revolution Critics however assert that the new course plan shortchanges students on the countrys European heritage and on key events before 1877 The syllabus makes room for the new emphasis on recent history by calculating that if students have studied the Revolution Civil War and other key events in the eighth grade they do not need to cover the same ground in high school We have lots of kids who werent even in the country in the seventh and eighth grades said Alan Weiner assistant principal for social studies at Hillcrest High School in Jamaica Queens Theyll never get indepth treatment of the Revolution westward expansion or the Civil War New York is one of two educationally influential states  the other is California  to release new curriculum guidelines this year Both were written in response to criticism that students today are not studying enough history and geography and that what they do get lacks a chronological coherence The two new curriculums also demonstrate the extent to which political and social trends affect school curriculums and the tradeoffs that are inevitable in a field such as social studies which tends to be a lightning rod for social controversy Political Document First Curriculums are political documents first education documents second said Donald H Bragaw chief of social studies for the New York State Education Department which wrote the new syllabus Mr Bragaw said that for the first time 7th and 11th grade American history guidelines include a discussion of a controversial theory that the Iroquois Confederacy a coalition of tribes had considerable influence on the framers of the United States Constitution Native American scholars have recently been lobbying to have this view introduced into the curriculum Another politically charged issue is the role of religion in shaping American history Over the last year several national groups  both liberal and conservative  have issued reports contending that American history textbooks do not pay sufficient attention to religion Society has sent a message that its OK to deal with religion again said Frances Haley executive director of the National Council of Social Studies The new California guidelines which begin immediately and will take two years to put into effect require teachers to emphasize the influence of religion in dealing with topics such as the Declaration of Independence abolition and the civil rights movement Major Changes In the Curriculum By contrast New Yorks new syllabus takes a more anthropological approach to religion focusing on it primarily in relation to the preColonial period Once you finish Puritanism it certainly is not emphasized Mr Salow said The new syllabus in New York State replaces one that was published in 1979 It is being used this year in grades 7 to 11 and next year in grade 12 The changes take on increased significance because of the Regents Action Plan a threeyearold comprehensive school improvement package in which the Board of Regents increased the number of years students must take social studies to four from three In grades 7 and 8 for example the oneyear courses on the cultural heritage of New York State and American history have been consolidated into a single twoyear sequence running from preColumbian times to the present emphasizing history geography and government The content is essentially the same but the framework is more chronological At the same time ninth graders used to study the cultures of Africa and Asia while 10th graders took a course in European Culture from the ancient world to the present emphasizing themes like nationalism and democracy Both courses will be replaced by a twoyear global studies program covering seven areas of the world starting with Africa and continuing with South Asia East Asia Latin America the Middle East Western Europe and Eastern Europe including the Soviet Union In grade 11 the existing American Studies course a largely nonchronological examination of themes such as economics foreign policy and the nature of the American population will be replaced by a United States history course that opens with a unit on the Constitution and then focuses on the period from the end of Reconstruction to the present By skipping to the present educators expect the students to be able to study previously neglected topics such as the Great Depression the Vietnam War and Watergate among other things And 12th graders will be required to take one semester of economics  already a longstanding policy in New York City  and another on participation in government Currently there are no such statewide requirements The government participation program which is still being developed is intended to promote civic values and get students involved in activities such as visiting a local political club or debating public policy issues such as abortion The state syllabus sets out basic topics that teachers are supposed to build into their own curriculums In the past teachers have had wide latitude in in this task but under the new plan the states curriculum ideas will be enforced by tests New Standardized Tests For Regents Diploma Tests designed to evaluate programs rather than individual students will be added at the sixth and eighth grades In addition a new Regents world history examination will be administered in June 1989 for 10th graders The 11th grade Regents Social Studies Examination which currently covers three years of study will be rewritten to emphasize United States history Students not seeking a Regents diploma will be required to pass a less demanding test in those two areas as a condition for graduation Some educators vigorously oppose the new tests This is the first time in New York State history that content has been mandated at the state level and taken out of the hands of local teachers said Stephen E Phillips acting director of high schools in New York City Everyone is talking about increasing teacher professionalism Then they come up with something like this that is diametrically opposed Anne Allen a teacher in Rochester likes the academic seriousness of the junior high school sequence Too much time was spent before in doing such things as making candles to illustrate Colonial days she said Others praised the shift from teaching themes or concepts to a more traditional chronological approach at least in grades 7 8 and 11 The conceptual approach was good for the brightest students said Ernest Southworth chairman of social studies at Tully High School south of Syracuse But average students couldnt grasp the relationship between say an economic trend in the 1700s and an immigration trend from the same era The chronological approach is easy for kids to understand Mr Bragaw the state social studies chief said that the new approach assumes that students will remember much of the preCivil War history that they learned in junior high school  an assumption also made by the California planners Under the new California syllabus fifth graders will concentrate on the preColonial period up through the Westward expansion and eighth graders will concentrate on the founding of the country through 1914 The 11th grade course will then review the Revolution Constitution and Civil War and jump to the 20th century Different Levels Of Understanding Another tradeoff faced by curriculum planners is whether to cover a number of topics or only a few in depth Both New York and California have tried to solve that by concentrating on particular eras in specific grades But this poses its own problems Does it mean that students will end up with a 5th grade understanding of the founding of the country an 8th grade understanding of the Civil War and an 11th grade understanding of the present asked Roger R Rogalin senior vice president of DC Heath and Company a major textbook publisher Mr Weiner of Hillcrest High School illustrated the problem with regard to the Emancipation Proclamation We now teach eighth graders that Lincoln freed the slaves he said But in reality the Emancipation Proclamation didnt free anybody It was a political document that only freed the slaves in the states that rebelled which didnt obey it It did unify the North and it kept England out of the war by giving them a moral problem But you cant teach that to a 13year old You have to wait until high school Another controversial aspect of the new New York State curriculum has been the increased emphasis on Latin America and other areas especially in the 9th and 10th grades Critics assert that such a change would result in the loss of an indepth treatment of Western Civilization A number of our assistant principals think that Europe should not be treated as just another area of the world said Mr Salow of the Board of Education They think that Western Europe is our culture and we have to know more about it Mr Salow called for more emphasis on multiethnic education within the American history framework There is a fair amount of Afrohistory he said but some of the other groups especially Latinos and Asians dont have as much as we would like Most teachers and curriculum specialists applaud the 12th grade emphasis on economics and participation in government but many say they are concerned that requiring those two courses will restrict the freedom of students to pursue elective or advanced placement courses Most of the high schools in Westchester communities have well established senior electives and for us to implement the Regents Action Plan weakens the program we already have said Sandra Kolk curriculum coordinator for social studies in Ardsley Union Free School District No senior graduates without an understanding of economics although the program is not a formal one Others however argue that the government course in particular is much needed Since the right to vote was given to 18yearolds weve seen the worst voter apathy in that group said John Osborn social studies coordinator in the North Salem school district We must turn that around
Teen-Age Pregnancy and Birth Rates Drop,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/20/us/teen-age-pregnancy-and-birth-rates-drop.html,Pregnancy and birth rates among teenagers in the United States have declined after increases in the 1970s but they are still much higher than in other industrialized countries researchers report We seem to have a more difficult time accepting the fact that some teens are sexually active said Barbara J Maciak a researcher with the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta In some of the other developed countries they are more open about it and teens are more comfortable seeking contraceptive services she said in an interview Thursday Eightyseven of every 1000 American teenage women 15 through 19 years old became pregnant in 1983 a decline of 16 percent from the 1980 rate Ms Maciak and colleagues at the centers reported in the new study That decline contrasts with an 82 percent rise over the previous six years which was attributed primarily to the increase in the proportion of teens who became sexually experienced according to the the report in the current issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association Birth Rate Dropped The birth rate for that age group also dropped in 1983 Slightly fewer than 52 of every 1000 teenage women gave birth down 23 percent from the 1980 rate the researchers said Teenage births dropped 92 percent from 1974 to 1980 they said with abortions accounting for a substantial part of the decline There were 58 live births for 1000 teenage women 15 to 19 years old in 1974 and 53 in 1980 But a reduced pregnancy rate accounted for the drop in the birth rate from 1980 to 1983 they said noting the abortion rate was stable in that period The researchers said Continued efforts aimed both at delaying early sexual experience among teens and encouraging the use of contraception among sexually active teens are necessary to further reduce teenage pregnancy and birth rates in this country Lag in the United States Other developed nations are doing much better than the United States in controlling both pregnancy and birth rates among teenagers the researchers said citing a survey by the Alan Guttmacher Institute a family planning organization in New York City The Guttmacher report calculated the number of pregnancies and births for each 1000 teenage women 15 to 19 years old in major developed countries in 1981 this way United States 96 pregnancies 54 births England and Wales 45 pregnancies 31 births Canada 44 pregnancies 28 births France 43 pregnancies 25 births Sweden 35 pregnancies 16 births The Netherlands 14 pregnancies nine births The institutes figures for the United States differ from those in the report of the Centers for Disease Control because of a slightly different reporting system said Susan Tew a spokeswoman for the institute We found they were much more tolerant of teenage sexual activity in most European countries than in most of the United States Ms Tew said She said the institute report TeenAge Pregnancy in Industrialized Countries concluded that the increasing availability of contraception and sex education helped reduce teenage pregnancy rates

Ads Against Bork Still Hotly Disputed,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/21/us/ads-against-bork-still-hotly-disputed.html,Supporters of Judge Robert H Bork who accuse his opponents of distorting his views have aimed special criticism at television and newspaper advertisements by liberal groups opposing his nomination Much of the criticism has been aimed at a 60second television spot paid for by People for the American Way in which the actor Gregory Peck said of Judge Bork among other things He defended poll taxes and literacy tests which kept many Americans from voting He opposed the civil rights law that ended whites only signs at lunch counters He doesnt believe the Constitution protects your right to privacy Whether this was a serious distortion as White House officials and others have charged is hotly disputed In fact Judge Bork had never said he personally favored poll taxes and literacy tests for voting and he said in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that he did not like poll taxes himself Criticism of Virginia Case But Judge Bork had harshly criticized as without constitutional foundation one Supreme Court ruling striking down Virginias poll tax calling it a very small tax that was not discriminatory He had also said a Supreme Court decision upholding an act of Congress that had banned states from using literacy tests was pernicious constitutional law because the statute had overridden an earlier decision upholding use of such tests Judge Borks reasoning on these cases was complex and legally respectable But defenders of the Peck ad say the bottom line was that ifhis view had prevailed the Supreme Court would have upheld the Virginia poll tax and struck down Congresss ban on literacy tests The Peck ad was accurate in stating that Judge Bork had opposed the law that desegregated lunch counters the public accommodations provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 But it neglected to mention that he had changed his mind later Principle of Ugliness In a 1963 article Mr Bork then a law professor had argued forcefully that while he personally disapproved of racism efforts to force white businessmen to serve black customers rested on a principle of unsurpassed ugliness the principle that moral disapproval could justify legal coercion Ten years later in Senate testimony on his nomination to be Solicitor General he said he had been mistaken and had come to support the public accommodations law As for the right to privacy Judge Bork had in fact long assailed the Supreme Courts creation of a generalized right of marital and sexual privacy which the Court has found to encompass contraception and abortion among other things But the nominee had also said that individual provisions of the Bill of Rights protect some aspects of privacy such as the Fourth Amendment right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures Ads Distorted Kropp Says Arthur J Kropp executive director of People for the American Way said its advertisements were fair advocacy in a healthy national debate on the role of courts in our society He said supporters of Judge Bork had distorted the advertisements in an effort to turn this into a dirty little exercise People for the American Way is a 250000member nonprofit organization founded in 1980 by a group of religious and civic leaders that concentrates on constitutional liberties issues and seeks to counteract the successful use of television by the religious right in support of conservative political causes Its founder was Norman Lear a television and film producer long active in liberal causes who is still one of its 48 directors Among the directors are former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas who testified against Judge Bork at the Judiciary Committee hearings Martin Sheen the actor and Andrew Heiskell former chairman of Time Inc
Of Bork and Tactics,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/21/us/of-bork-and-tactics.html,President Reagan and other supporters of Judge Robert H Borks Supreme Court nomination have shifted the focus from the nominee to the tactics used by his critics in a strikingly vitriolic offensive Given the recent heated acrimony over a Senate aides effort to keep a proBork witness from testifying and given a proBork advertising campaign that is now in full counterattack against the judges opponents the bitterness that has aleady made this battle the most contentious in the modern history of Supreme Court nominations may well reach a peak when the debate gets to the Senate floor perhaps as early as Wednesday Almost nobody thinks Judge Bork will win confirmation But the battle over what Bork supporters say was the lynching of the nominee has focused attention on some questions of lasting importance Has the confirmation process been fair to Judge Bork Has public opinion been poisoned against him by distortions of his views Has the process been too politicized and if so which side is to blame Distortions on Both Sides Some of the answers are clear There have been distortions of Judge Borks complex views and his record by some on both sides of the battle Partisans on both sides have resorted to emotionally charged simplistic political appeals to rally support and raise money It is also clear that the confirmation process has been steeped in the tactics of modern political campaigns to an extent perhaps unmatched in history Paid advertisements grassroots organizing and public opinion polls have played a highly visible role Following very successful advertising campaigns by antiBork groups proBork advertisements and fundraising appeals in the last few days have assailed the integrity of those opposing the nomination And Judge Bork himself found it necessary to give the first detailed nationally televised testimony ever by a Supreme Court nominee about his positions on controversial issues It is more difficult to gauge the effect on public opinion of the distortions which were mixed together with much fair advocacy by both sides But the evidence that antiBork distortions have dominated the process is weak Judge Bork was given ample opportunity in his 32 hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee to make his points and rebut criticisms as most of his supporters on the committee have publicly acknowledged While one proBork witness was dissuaded from testifying by an antiBork staff aides warning that the crossexamination would be rough 62 other witnesses testified for the nominee compared with 48 who testified against him Politicization of the Process The 54 senators who have announced against Judge Bork including all four Judiciary Committee members who were undecided when the hearings started have cited close study of his own writings speeches and testimony as the reasons for their decisions They have angrily rejected suggestions by Bork supporters who say they were too cowardly to resist a stampede of misinformed public opinion Distortions aside the politicization of the confirmation process by Bork opponents was spurred by the highly political nature of the nomination itself It culminated the most systematic effort in 50 years to reverse the direction and reduce the power of the Federal judiciary by a President who as a candidate in 1980 called one Supreme Court abortion ruling an abuse of power as bad as Watergate The nomination came at a time when the Courts ideological balance was at a tipping point and the Senate was controlled by Democrats who do not want dramatic change Many were elected last year despite vehement campaign appeals by President Reagan urging election of a Republican Senate to help him replace liberal judges with tough lawandorder conservatives While the nominee himself had a distinguished record as Solicitor General and judge he owed his national reputation chiefly to his long and distinctive history of eloquently attacking the legitimacy of dozens of the most important Supreme Court decisions expanding individual rights dating from 1922 This history provided the point of departure for opponents The more partisan of them caricatured Judge Borks views as more radical than they were At the same time many Bork supporters implausibly depicted him as a moderate who as White House lobbyists put it in briefing papers would not change the Courts balance in any way The Ad Campaigns Whatever the effect of the competing distortions on the outcome even some opponents of the nominee privately concede that Judge Bork and his family have reason to feel aggrieved by aspects of the advertising campaign some liberal groups mounted against him The nominees intellectual potency freedom from bigotry personal decency and integrity were attested to by friends of all political persuasions But some of the advertisements and other statements by critics painted a frightening portrait based upon exaggerations of and highly creative extrapolations from his past statements A newspaper advertisement by People for the American Way headlined Robert Bork vs the People suggested that he stood for sterilizing workers no privacy and a possible agenda to turn back the clock on civil rights An advertisement by the National Abortion Rights Action League began with the warning that he might seek to wipe out every advance women have made in the 20th century The finer print in these advertisements anchored these generalizations to simplified arguably slanted descriptions of statements Judge Bork had actually made These statements might have been alarming to the constituencies at which the ads were aimed even if Judge Borks own language had been quoted more fully and fairly as it was in detailed papers circulated by the same groups that placed the advertisements But as phrased the advertisements turned complex issues into slogans and seemed at least as likely to provoke simplistic fears as to spread real understanding Effect of Ads Limited On the other hand for all the indignation and attention focused by Bork supporters on these advertisements there is little evidence that they have had a major effect on the outcome any more than did the simplistic and emotional advertisements placed by proBork groups Results of public opinion polls indicate that the sharpest swing against the judge resulted from his five days of televised testimony The bearded professorial nominee his narrow appraoch to constitutional and his nuanced views did not win the hearts of the public The thought that his lack of a telegenic presence may have hurt Judge Bork is disquieting to those concerned about subjecting the judiciary to the blowdried imagemaking of the modern electoral process But whether or not they liked his beard those who watched the Judiciary Committee hearings saw perhaps the deepest exploration of fundamental constitutional issues ever to capture the public limelight Most of those who testified against Judge Bork like many of those who lobbied against him based their positions on careful analysis of his statements on key issues and avoided the kind of inflammatory rhetoric into which the more partisan senators on each side of the battle sometimes slipped Contrasts From Nominee In fact some of the prominent lawyers and scholars who testified against Judge Bork described his more controversial writings at least as accurately as Judge Bork did in his own testimony While explicitly backing away from some important aspects of his previous positions the nominee also characterized some of the statements he had made in the past in ways that contrasted with the original versions For example he testified repeatedly last month that while he had long denounced the Supreme Courts 1965 decision striking down a Connecticut law that made it a crime even for married couples to use contraception he had not meant that the law should necessarily have been upheld Rather he testified his criticisms had been aimed only at the Courts rationale  the way in which this right of privacy was created Before his nomination however Judge Bork had asserted repeatedly consistently and unequivocally that the result in that case Griswold v Connecticut could not have been reached by proper interpretation of the Constitution as he put it in a 1982 speech He had noted that he considered the Connecticut law silly as a matter of policy but had asserted quite emphatically that the Court had no constitutional mandate to strike it down
Candidates for Nassau Executive Clash in Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/21/nyregion/candidates-for-nassau-executive-clash-in-debate.html,The two major candidates for Nassau County Executive agreed yesterday on the problems that threaten the quality of life in the county but clashed over how to resolve them In a spirited hourlong debate at The New York Times County Executive Thomas S Gulotta the Republican and his Democratic opponent Raymond B Grunewald offered dramatically different solutions to garbage disposal congested roadways polluted drinking water and a shrinking pool of affordable housing in Nassau one of the nations wealthiest and most populous counties Mr Gulotta who was appointed County Executive 10 months ago when Francis Purcell resigned to take a job as a television commentator is heavily favored to win the race for the remaining twoyear term Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 3to2 ratio and a Democrat has not been County Executive in almost 20 years Planning Is Criticized In the debate Mr Grunewald a 59yearold lawyer and former Federal prosecuter launched a series of stinging attacks on Mr Gulotta criticizing him and his Republican predecessors for a lack of vision and longrange planning in addressing the countys most pressing transit housing and environmental problems Mr Gulotta 43 who was presiding supervisor of the Town of Hempstead before his appointment avoided personal rebukes and defended his administrations accomplishments However he repeatedly challenged Mr Grunewalds proposals to create countywide agencies on water environmental and solid waste disposal as costly and unnecessary bureaucracies Two other candidates participated in the debate Jack Olchin a deputy Nassau County attorney who is the Liberal candidate sided with Mr Gulotta on many issues while also calling for the creation of a county legislature similar to Suffolk Countys Dr Raymond J Vuolo the RighttoLife candidate said his priority would be to end Medicaidfinanced abortions at the Nassau County Medical Center New Agencies Proposed The debate was dominated however by the sparring between Mr Gulotta and Mr Grunewald The Republican machine has failed to address the environmental and ecological problems as they exist said Mr Grunewald He said he would create a Department of Environmental Conservation and a county Water Authority to oversee water quality and conservation programs Mr Gulotta defended the countys environmental record pointing to a comprehensive water management and conservation plan that took effect Aug 1 He also cited the countys aggressive purchase of open space In addition Mr Gulotta lambasted Mr Grunewalds proposed agencies The creation of an authority would only be another layer of government more costly and nonresponsive to the taxpayers Mr Gulotta said We shouldnt avoid our responsibility as elected officials to deal with these crucial issues At Odds Over Garbage The candidates also clashed over how to dispose of solid waste Mr Gulotta said Nassau provides 32 million a year to the countys three towns and two cities to assist their solidwaste disposal programs He rejected the idea of a countywide authority citing binding waste disposal contracts the municipalities already have Mr Grunewald however called for a new countywide Solid Waste Authority to coordinate waste disposal In the process he jabbed at previous Republican administrations Its the countys responsibility said Mr Grunewald We wouldnt have the garbage mountains if we had had a viable garbagedisposal program even as late as five years ago Both candidates said they opposed using landfills but while Mr Gulotta favored building cleanburning incinerators Mr Grunewald said recycling 100 percent of all refuse should be the countys ultimate goal Voting With Their Feet Mr Gulotta said the county recently announced that a site at Mitchel Field would be used as a countywide recycling center Mr Grunewald criticized the countys recycling efforts saying that as much as 65 to 70 percent of the countys garbage should be recyclable now With the pool of affordable housing shrinking in Nassau Mr Grunewald said that young couples and the elderly were voting with their feet and leaving the county Your administration and your predecessor administrations have consistently failed do anything with housing for senior citizens and young people Mr Grunewald told Mr Gulotta Counties by state law do not have the power to construct housing Mr Gulotta said his administration had taken a survey of available county land and was working to donate land to towns cities and villages which are empowered to build to ease the housing crisis New Rail Lines Favored The candidates also offered different solutions to the countys traffic problems Mr Gulotta said he has proposed a 28 million bond issue to improve the countys most hazardous intersections renovate bridges and repair and synchronize traffic lights to speed the flow of traffic He also said Nassau and Suffolk Counties have obtained 150 million in state funds to repair state roads To encourage the use of mass transit Mr Gulotta said the county has obtained 15 million to add 716 parking spaces at three Long Island Rail Road stations Mr Grunewald called the projects bandaid solutions that would fail to wean people away from their cars Instead he advocated creating a lightrail system that would link heavily congested areas particularly along the countys northsouth routes
SPORTS OF THE TIMES; 'Replacement' Cardinals Won't Quit,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/22/sports/sports-of-the-times-replacement-cardinals-won-t-quit.html,This was before Tom Lawless ticked off the Minnesota Twins with his homerun trot last night On Tuesday Tommy Herr had sounded almost disappointed as he described what a nice quiet bunch of professionals the Minnesota Twins seem to be This team has done nothing to inflame us the way the Giants did Herr said referring to Jeffrey Leonards flapsdown hand gestures during his four homerun trots in the league championships The Cardinals found themselves without a convenient target on the field but they believed they could come back from anything  injuries enemies slights momentum you name it There was one bit of incentive in yesterdays USA Today from Reggie Jackson working for ABC in this Series Reggie had told Rudy Martzke There are no marquee players in this World Series You could say these are replacement players When I make out my lineup card I have to put first names down to remember who these guys are Im still trying to find out who Tom Lawless is Lawless had not seen the quote when he came to the park but he was reminded of it several hours later after he had clubbed his second majorleague homer a threerun blast to help the Cardinals beat the Twins 72 and tie up the World Series Reggie was absolutely right in his assessment of the Cardinals Lawless is another of those replacements the Cardinals are using because of injuries to Jack Clark and Terry Pendleton Last week the Cardinals won the pennant on the third majorleague home run by Jose Oquendo another replacement and last night Lawless gave the Cardinals a huge boost with his home run in the everdangerous fourth inning He was not aware of the replacement remark as he stood at home plate and watched the ball soar to left field He did not plan his nonchalant stance at home plate or the happy little flip he gave to the bat when the ball bounced off homerun territory Ive hit the ball pretty well here Lawless said But this is a big stadium for a little guy like myself He said he stood near home plate because there were runners on first and third bases and I knew I couldnt pass Jose at first base HIS start was even slower than Jeffrey Leonards slowmotion trots that had been intended to antagonize the Cardinals Lawless pace was not meant to upset anybody but he did give his manager Whitey Herzog a few anxious moments When he hit it and stood there I figured it was in the upper deck Herzog said He said he hit it as good as anybody and I said Youd better run  Did Lawless stance remind Herzog of any other great majorleague slugger Without a trace of irony the manager replied Id put it right up there with Reggie Actually Lawless nonchalant flip and slow trot did not remind the Twins Don Baylor of any great hitter he has ever seen I never saw Reggie Jackson do anything like that or Hank Aaron or Frank Robinson or Harmon Killebrew Tom Lawless Youve got to be kidding me Baylor said But maybe that was just the sound of the Twins realizing they had just lost two games and their advantage and they were slapping their faces with any brand of aftershaver lotion they could find and saying to themselves Thanks I needed that It was hardly Herzogs intention to try to win a World Series with Oquendo playing every day and Lawless starting against lefthanders Herzog is happiest when he doesnt even use his final replacement Tom Lawless He could play the infield the outfield and he learned to catch Herzog said Hes so versatile that with the 24man roster I just couldnt use him Lawless became standby equipment as Nelson Rockefeller once said of the vice presidency but last night the standby equipment was needed not to cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate but to break a tie in a World Series game The shots by Oquendo and Lawless may have stunned the Giants and the Twins but the resiliency of the Cardinals will be no surprise in a certain East Coast city THE Cardinals made believers of every New Yorker in midSeptember when they crawled back from a 41 deficit to catch the Mets on that fateful Friday night in Shea Stadium when Terry Pendletons swat over the centerfield fence was like a baseball bat in the solar plexus to the entire New York region We still have to get something we want said Herr one of those quiet men of the Cardinal clubhouse who never raises his voice but who displays his heart as openly as the Abortion  American Terrorism sticker on his wall right below six photographs of his two sons He can remember the joy of the 1982 championship the bitterness of blowing a threegamestoone lead to Kansas City the resentment of the Mets exuberance in recent years and Leonard and the Giants proclaiming their superiority two weeks ago The Giants really added fuel to the fire Herr said Tuesday night after John Tudors 31 victory Had they approached things a little differently they might have won They just had to show a little respect let sleeping dogs lie so to speak but it seemed they tried to antagonize us They might have won especially with the wounded lineup we had but we used that to our advantage Now the Twins may be thinking of using Lawless fond stare to their advantage But in the meantime the Cardinals have tied the Series with their ultimate replacement And as Lawless said after Reggies honest remark finally caught up with him Now everybody knows who he is
"Borks Nomination Is Rejected, 58-42; Reagan Saddened",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/politics/borks-nomination-is-rejected-5842-reagan-saddened.html,WASHINGTON Oct 23  One of the fiercest battles ever waged over a Supreme Court nominee ended today as the Senate decisively rejected the nomination of Judge Robert H Bork The vote was 58 against confirmation and 42 in favor the biggest margin by which the Senate has ever rejected a Supreme Court nomination [ Roll call page 10 ] Judge Borks was the 27th Supreme Court nomination to fail in the countrys history the sixth in this century and the first since 1970 when the Senate rejected President Nixons nomination of G Harrold Carswell by a vote of 51 to 45 There have been 104 Supreme Court justices in the nations history Bork Glad Debate Took Place The vote came two weeks after Judge Bork in the face of expected defeat said he would not withdraw his name and wanted the full Senate to vote on his nomination In a statement issued from his chambers at the Federal courthouse here where he still serves on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge Bork said he was glad the debate took place There is now a full and permanent record by which the future may judge not only me but the proper nature of a confirmation proceeding the 60yearold judge said President Reagan in a statement released by the White House said I am saddened and disappointed that the Senate has bowed today to a campaign of political pressure The Next Nominee In the final hours of the threeday debate on the Senate floor senators turned their attention to the next nominee for the vacancy on the court The White House is not expected to name a new candidate before the middle of next week The President has publicly vowed to find a nominee who will upset Judge Borks opponents just as much as Judge Bork himself Mr Reagan said today My next nominee for the Court will share Judge Borks belief in judicial restraint  that a judge is bound by the Constitution to interpret laws not make them Meanwhile senators on both sides of the debate urged the President to adopt a less confrontational tone I would recommend they not send someone as controversial Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee said at a news conference after the vote In his closing remarks on the Senate floor Senator Thurmond called Judge Bork a great judge who would have adorned the Supreme Court with honor At his news conference Senator Thurmond added that as a matter of fairness the next nominee should be from the South Justice Lewis F Powell Jr whose retirement last June created the vacancy is from Virginia and there is now no Southerner on the Court Democrats were more pointed in their warnings to the White House If we receive a nominee who thinks like Judge Bork who acts like Judge Bork who opposes civil rights and civil liberties like Judge Bork he will be rejected like Judge Bork just like that Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts said on the Senate floor A Dozen Names Mentioned Reagan Administration officials have been closedmouthed about who the next nominee might be More than a dozen names have been mentioned by officials and others as possibilities perhaps most prominently six conservative Federal appellate judges They are Laurence H Silberman 52 of Washington a former Deputy Attorney General and Ambassador to Yugoslavia Anthony M Kennedy 51 of Sacramento a favorite of some Justice Department officials J Clifford Wallace 58 of San Diego who is said to be close to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d but who has already attracted some opposition from liberals who say he opposes strict separation of church and state Pasco M Bowman 2d 53 of Kansas City Mo a former law school dean Ralph K Winter Jr 52 of New Haven a friend and former Yale Law School colleague of Judge Bork and Patrick E Higginbotham 48 of Dallas who is highly regarded by some officials but has been criticized both by opponents and by supporters of abortion rights for his complex ruling in one case The Senate Democratic leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia urged the Administration to consult with the Senate before submitting a new name Democratic leaders had warned the White House in June that Judge Borks nomination would engender deep opposition A Hint of Consultations Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said after the vote that Howard H Baker Jr the White House chief of staff had told him today that no choice had yet been made but that Administration officials would discuss the matter with Democratic leaders next week But Senator Biden said he was not certain that the White House was committed to advance consultations It may very well be that he will just come up here with a name Senator Biden said of Mr Baker Six Republicans joined 52 Democrats in voting against Judge Bork while 2 Democrats David L Boren of Oklahoma and Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina joined the 40 Republicans who voted in his favor By the time the Senate convened this morning only three senators had not announced their positions John W Warner a Virginia Republican and two Democrats William Proxmire of Wisconsin and John C Stennis of Mississippi All three voted against Judge Bork The Agony of a Loyalist The biggest surprise was Senator Warner who had been openly agonizing for weeks over the decision The ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee Senator Warner is almost unfailingly loyal to the Administration But in a brief speech on the Senate floor he said that Mr Reagans recent statement that the opposition to Judge Bork was a lynch mob was unbecoming the office of the Presidency Senator Warner who once served as a law clerk for a former chief judge on the court where Mr Bork now sits said that he wanted to support the nominee However he said I searched the record I looked at this distinguished jurist and I cannot find in him the record of compassion of sensitivity and understanding of the pleas of the people to enable him to sit on the highest Court of the land Although the outcome of the vote today was decided more than two weeks ago when the number of senators on record as opposing confirmation reached a majority a sense of drama nonetheless arose in the Senate chamber when the moment came shortly after 2 PM The galleries were filled both with members of the general public and with leaders of organizations that had played leading roles in lobbying for and against confirmation In an ordinary rollcall vote senators wander through the chamber chatting with colleagues and voting by a casual hand signal But for this vote Senator Byrd asked senators to remain at their seats and vote As the clerk called each name senators stood up intoning aye or no in solemn voices Family in the Visitors Gallery But earlier in the day the scene was less dramatic than poignant Then the chamber was nearly deserted save for a few senators making their final speeches and Judge Borks wife Mary Ellen and two sons who sat expressionless in the visitors gallery They left before the vote began Mrs Bork and the judges children Charles Ellen and Robert Jr had sat with him in his five days of testimony last month before the Judiciary Committee In his statement today Judge Bork said that his familys love and counsel sustained me throughout the extended process we have been through together Senator John C Danforth a Missouri Republican who was a student of Judge Borks at Yale Law School gave a long speech on his behalf this morning contending that opponents had distorted the nominees record and defeated him by making the public afraid of him The normally softspoken Senator continued his voice rising What has happened to Robert Bork is wrong The mans been trashed in our house Some of us helped generate the trashing others yielded to it but all of us are accomplices Senator Biden replied that Senator Danforth was making one heck of an indictment of your colleagues by suggesting that senators had not reached independent decisions on Judge Bork but had succumbed to raw pressure Senator Biden continued I have a higher opinion of the ability of my colleagues to do whats right A Great Debate Later in closing the debate the Judiciary Committee chairman said This has been a great debate a debate about fundamental principle about how one interprets the Constitution Senator Biden repeated the statement with which he opened Judge Borks confirmation hearings last month and which he has made a theme for the entire proceeding I believe I have rights because I exist in spite of my government not because of my government he said Judge Bork believes that rights flow from the majority through the Constitution to individuals a notion I reject After the vote Senator Biden said that although I enjoy winning this particular victory was less enjoyable than others because we are talking about a man who had to sit home and listen to this a fine man who just had a view of the Constitution that is out of touch with the 1980s and 1990s The debate thus ended with Judge Borks supporters and opponents holding fundamentally irreconcilable views of what had gone wrong for the nominee His supporters insisted that he had been misunderstood and mischaracterized while his opponents maintained that he lost precisely because the senators and their constituents did understand his views and rejected them

Administration officials would discuss the matter with Democratic leaders next week But Senator Biden said he was not certain that the White House was committed to advance consultations It may very well be that he will just come up here with a name Senator Biden said of Mr Baker Six Republicans joined 52 Democrats in voting against Judge Bork while 2 Democrats David L Boren of Oklahoma and Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina joined the 40 Republicans who voted in his favor By the time the Senate convened this morning only three senators had not announced their positions John W Warner a Virginia Republican and two Democrats William Proxmire of Wisconsin and John C Stennis of Mississippi All three voted against Judge Bork The Agony of a Loyalist The biggest surprise was Senator Warner who had been openly agonizing for weeks over the decision The ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee Senator Warner is almost unfailingly loyal to the Administration But in a brief speech on the Senate floor he said that Mr Reagans recent statement that the opposition to Judge Bork was a lynch mob was unbecoming the office of the Presidency Senator Warner who once served as a law clerk for a former chief judge on the court where Mr Bork now sits said that he wanted to support the nominee However he said I searched the record I looked at this distinguished jurist and I cannot find in him the record of compassion of sensitivity and understanding of the pleas of the people to enable him to sit on the highest Court of the land Although the outcome of the vote today was decided more than two weeks ago when the number of senators on record as opposing confirmation reached a majority a sense of drama nonetheless arose in the Senate chamber when the moment came shortly after 2 PM The galleries were filled both with members of the general public and with leaders of organizations that had played leading roles in lobbying for and against confirmation In an ordinary rollcall vote senators wander through the chamber chatting with colleagues and voting by a casual hand signal But for this vote Senator Byrd asked senators to remain at their seats and vote As the clerk called each name senators stood up intoning aye or no in solemn voices Family in the Visitors Gallery But earlier in the day the scene was less dramatic than poignant Then the chamber was nearly deserted save for a few senators making their final speeches and Judge Borks wife Mary Ellen and two sons who sat expressionless in the visitors gallery They left before the vote began Mrs Bork and the judges children Charles Ellen and Robert Jr had sat with him in his five days of testimony last month before the Judiciary Committee In his statement today Judge Bork said that his familys love and counsel sustained me throughout the extended process we have been through together Senator John C Danforth a Missouri Republican who was a student of Judge Borks at Yale Law School gave a long speech on his behalf this morning contending that opponents had distorted the nominees record and defeated him by making the public afraid of him The normally softspoken Senator continued his voice rising What has happened to Robert Bork is wrong The mans been trashed in our house Some of us helped generate the trashing others yielded to it but all of us are accomplices Senator Biden replied that Senator Danforth was making one heck of an indictment of your colleagues by suggesting that senators had not reached independent decisions on Judge Bork but had succumbed to raw pressure Senator Biden continued I have a higher opinion of the ability of my colleagues to do whats right A Great Debate Later in closing the debate the Judiciary Committee chairman said This has been a great debate a debate about fundamental principle about how one interprets the Constitution Senator Biden repeated the statement with which he opened Judge Borks confirmation hearings last month and which he has made a theme for the entire proceeding I believe I have rights because I exist in spite of my government not because of my government he said Judge Bork believes that rights flow from the majority through the Constitution to individuals a notion I reject After the vote Senator Biden said that although I enjoy winning this particular victory was less enjoyable than others because we are talking about a man who had to sit home and listen to this a fine man who just had a view of the Constitution that is out of touch with the 1980s and 1990s The debate thus ended with Judge Borks supporters and opponents holding fundamentally irreconcilable views of what had gone wrong for the nominee His supporters insisted that he had been misunderstood and mischaracterized while his opponents maintained that he lost precisely because the senators and their constituents did understand his views and rejected them THE SUPREME COURT OTHER NOMINATIONS THAT FAILED IN THE 20TH CENTURY John J Parker The campaign to reject Mr Parker a Federal judge from North Carolina nominated in 1930 by President Hoover stemmed in part from objections to the highly conservative antilabor majority on the Supreme Court The Senate vote was 41 to 39 Abe Fortas In June 1968 President Johnson nominated Mr Fortas an Associate Justice to replace Earl Warren on his retirement as Chief Justice After more than three months of often acrimonious Senate debate Mr Fortas withdraw his name In May 1969 Mr Fortas resigned after a disclosure by Life magazine that after becoming a Justice he accepted 20000 from a foundation connected to the family of an indicted stock manipulator Homer Thornberry At the same time that President Johnson nominated Mr Fortas as Chief Justice he named Homer Thornberry to fill Mr Fortass seat on the Court When Mr Fortass name was withdrawn the Thornberry nomination died a quiet death Clement F Haynsworth Jr In August 1969 President Nixon nominated Judge Haynsworth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to fill the vacancy created by Mr Fortass resignation During the confirmation hearings however he was labeled antilabor and was accused of ethical insensitivity for ruling in some cases in which he had a small financial stake He was defeated in the Senate 55 to 45 G Harrold Carswell After his nomination of Mr Haynsworth was rejected President Nixon nominated Judge Carswell to the seat Mr Carswell who had six months experience on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was defeated 51 to 45
Robertson Urges New Policy To Increase U.S. Birth Rate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/robertson-urges-new-policy-to-increase-us-birth-rate.html,Pat Robertson the Republican Presidential hopeful said today that Government policy should encourage the birth of more American children to pay future bills and to stave off the decline of our culture and our values Without a higher birth rate he said in an interview with a television reporter Western nations would be extremely vulnerable to threats from other ideologies Mr Robertson first raised the idea Thursday night in a speech to an antiabortion group that assists women with unwanted pregnancies He continued on the same theme in todays interview with Linda Douglas of KNBCTV in Los Angeles Thursday night he said Americans were having too few babies while 15 million were aborted every year At current birth rates of 18 live births per thousand population he said by the year 2020 we are not going to have enough money to take care of all the retirees there wont be enough money for Goverment there wont be enough people to expand the markets And our share of the world populaton Im talking about the total West  will have come in 100 years from 33 percent of all the people in the world to 7 12 percent Challenge to Culture Seen That not only means he continued that we will no longer have any dominance in the world but our culture and our values will at that point be squeezed out by many other conflicting ideologies by other national interests This means what well be as a nation extremely vulnerable as well as our allies in Europe This is a very very serious matter long range for our children grandchildren everything else Speaking to the antiabortion group Crisis Pregnancy at White River Junction Vt Thursday night Mr Robertson departed from what was to be a nonpolitical speech to pledge that if elected President he would veto any amendment to any budget bill providing even one penny to the national Planned Parenthood organization even if the veto meant bringing the entire Government to a halt The pledge brought a sustained ovation from the crowd of about 300 in a motel banquet room Crisis Pregnancy provides counseling clothing and other necessities to women with unwanted pregnancies Mr Robertson told the group that in addition to moral arguments for rejecting abortion there were the practical considerations attendent to a low birth rate among them a low population base of workingage people to support the necessities of Social Security and health care for the growing number of retired The problems of Social Security remained on Mr Robertsons mind later in Concord when he addressed the New Hampshire Health Care Coalition which has medical care for the elderly as one of its primary concerns There he again brought up the low birth rate and said that by 2020 43 percent of the adult work force would be pensioners Expanded Emphasis on Family How will a shrinking work force take care of an everexpanding elderly population he said We must have more children to expand the work force Todays comments were new elements in Mr Robertsons stump effort to emphasize problems of the American family in his campaign On Wednesday in an address to Republican Party regulars at a precinct meeting in Newport News in his home state of Virginia Mr Robertson said The greatest social problem in America is the breakup of the American family He went on to say that 30 percent of all divorces are caused by welfare laws which he said encouraged fathers to leave home to allow mothers to collect child welfare payments The time has come he continued when instead of giving money to people who might not necessarily be the productive sector isnt it time we begin to reward families husbands and wives who bring up their children to be lawful Godfearing citizens of America Wouldnt it be appropriate to realize that we are short on the tax deduction for dependents It hasnt kept up with inflation Could we give them a 3000 to 4000 tax deduction every year for each child He said that he supported equal pay for equal work for women in the workplace but added If we can afford to give tax deductions to working women for childcare support we can also afford to give tax deductions to women who want to stay home and look after their children Mr Robertson also emphasized the need for a return to basic education in the schools and called for voluntary prayer in the schools Couldnt we go back to a curriculum that stresses moral values and could we put God back in the schools he asked The audience of about 75 people in the precinct meeting said by party officials to be about evenly split between party regulars and new Robertson recruits applauded warmly They also applauded when he said One of the most important things we can do is get control back in the hands of the parents and teachers in the school and take it out of the national headquarters of a powerful lobby and teachers union with strong leftist tendencies
WHAT PRICE ADVOCACY?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/25/books/what-price-advocacy.html,THE TENTH JUSTICE The Solicitor General and the Rule of Law By Lincoln Caplan 352 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1995 WE are in a time  rare in American history  when the struggle to control the judiciary is a central element of our politics The extended debate over the Presidents nomination of Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court is the most evident example of the intensity of concern But it is not the only battleground in the extraordinary effort by the Reagan Administration to alter substantially the way in which the Constitution is interpreted and its impact on our daily lives In this rather chilling account Lincoln Caplan a staff writer for The New Yorker where portions of the book recently appeared ties this struggle over constitutional vision to the history of the littleknown office of the Solicitor General a part of the Justice Department that is responsible for arguing most of the Governments cases in the Supreme Court In The Tenth Justice he seeks to demonstrate that the Reagan Administration has stripped the office of its traditional autonomy debased its credibility and turned it into an ideological mouthpiece for views at odds with the mainstream of constitutional law Mr Caplan shows how the Solicitor General is a hinge between the Executive Branch and the Court In its finest moments the office of the Solicitor General has been the Tenth Justice of Mr Caplans title highly trusted by the nine Justices often as in the days of Archibald Cox almost like a professor instructing the Court on the direction the law ought to take Among the distinguished Solicitors General have been not only Mr Bork and Mr Cox but Thurgood Marshall Erwin Griswold and Wade McCree The office has influenced the Courts decisions in some of the most sensitive areas including school desegregation reapportionment affirmative action and issues involving church and state The Solicitor General has had the delicate task of reflecting and channeling the momentum of the Court while at the same time speaking for a Government that was not always ready to accept the direction the law was taking It is a tradition of limited autonomy born out of respect for the Solicitors special role that makes bearable the tension between his role as Government lawyer and 10th Justice It is Mr Caplans view that the current Administration has failed to follow the tradition thereby harming the contribution the office makes to constitutional development Mr Caplan makes this a dramatic story almost a soap opera in which constitutional battles are also about personal strengths and weaknesses  the noble efforts of Rex Lee the Reagan Administrations first Solicitor General to maintain some degree of independence harmonizing the Administrations intensely felt views with the contradictory precedents of the Court the seeming lack of candor and strongarmed evangelism of William Bradford Reynolds the assistant Attorney General whom Mr Caplan characterizes contemptuously as the Shadow Solicitor and the current Solicitor Generals tooeasy readiness to please his client  the Administration But the meat of Mr Caplans account is not about personal arrogance or struggles for turf or the sanctity of traditions It is really about the Administrations view that the nation requires a constitutional philosophy sharply different from the dominant philosophy of the last three decades Mr Caplan realizes that the Reagan Administration means business when it talks about the need for change but he is not willing to recognize its right to press the Solicitor General into the service of its views He cites speech after speech in which the Attorney General and his deputies have announced their goal of altering the judicial role as it has developed over the recent past Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d wishes to accomplish specific results Not for him are the kind of general instructions to the Solicitor General that provide comfortable independence Like the large corporation that wishes its lawyers to make particular results come about this Administration has made very clear what it wants In this climate a Solicitor General is just another lawyer trying to maintain the myth of professional detachment Indeed no one including the author should be surprised that the Administration uses every possible tool to achieve its objectives Why should it not seek a Supreme Court that will fulfill its dreams making appointments more shrewdly than most where the nature of the candidates judicial philosophy is specifically ascertained Why should anyone be surprised if an office like the Solicitor Generals is enlisted in the campaign Among those with so righteous a cause dissent and moderation are not to be tolerated Though The Tenth Justice is largely a polemic against the Reagan Administration Mr Caplan successfully places much of the constitutional debate in the context of current philosophical movements in jurisprudence He seeks to show how ever stronger movements of the left as well as the right have undermined support for the legitimacy of the legacy of the Warren Court But in the last analysis he is examining events from his perspective which is the mainstream view of the last quartercentury FOR Mr Caplan the diminution of the traditions of independence in the Solicitor Generals office is one of the great misdeeds of the Reagan Administration and indicates its attitude toward the rule of law But as Mr Caplan also recognizes whether this indictment is true depends in large part on a reading of constitutional history For example if one thinks that fundamental errors have been imposed in constitutional analysis over the last 50 years if one condemns the application of the Bill of Rights to states laws if one is utterly dismayed by the Courts views on affirmative action or reapportionment or prayer in the schools then the rule of law looks corroded and in need of repair For Mr Caplan  because the decisions of this period advancing civil rights recognizing the right to abortion correcting deepseated deficiencies in the structure of state legislatures and confirming a wall of separation between church and state all arrived at through active constitutional decision making are the right ones  the rule of law persists and the actions of the Reagan Administration are hostile to it The Tenth Justice is important because what is at stake is something far more than the fate and tradition of the Solicitor Generals office That can be resuscitated easily and its reputation revived in a day What is at issue is the nations political agenda and the role the courts and other institutions play in shaping it AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP The relationship between the Supreme Court and the SGs office has long been more intimate than anyone at either place likes to acknowledge From the nineteentwenties and possibly before through the early seventies once a Solicitor General was confirmed by the Senate he began his tenure by paying his respects to the Court and formally calling on each of the Justices As an old SG hand put it They impressed on the Solicitor General their reliance on the accuracy and trustworthiness of the governments briefs and their expectation of high quality They put the fear of the Lord in a new SG and he would come back to the office determined that the highest standards would be met During the first visit of one new SG Justice Frankfurter gave him detailed instructions to pass on to the lawyers in the SGs office one should keep his voice up during arguments another shouldnt talk so much and a third was hopelessly dull and should not be allowed to argue at all Paul Freund said It doesnt take a sledgehammer to make an impression when a member of the Court says something to the Solicitor General From The Tenth Justice
THOSE FRACTIOUS REPUBLICANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/25/magazine/those-fractious-republicans.html,CHEERS ECHOED through Iowa State Universitys Hilton Coliseum to the brassy theme song from Rocky A human wall in white Tshirts Robertson for President was chanting Go for it Pat The candidate the Rev Marion G Pat Robertson television evangelist turned politician smiled warmly at the emotional pandemonium he had touched off And then he plunged into the crowd hugging his followers Their passion evoked underdogs from elections past  fervent youth flocking to Senator Eugene McCarthys protest over the Vietnam War in 1968 angry Dixie Democrats rallying to Gov George Wallace of Alabama and stalking away from Hubert Humphrey the 1968 Democratic nominee or Barry Goldwaters conservative army seizing the Republican Party in 1964 Already in the 1988 race the Robertson phenomenon has jolted Republican Party regulars with organizational victories in Michigan South Carolina and Iowa Even if Robertson lacks enough support to win the nomination his movement is deepening divisions in Republican ranks  divisions that threaten to splinter the Reagan coalition the key to Republican power since 1981 For Ronald Reagan has held together an amalgam of incongruous factions  wellheeled Republican businessmen and disaffected redneck southern Democrats hightech suburban yuppies and ethnic bluecollar workers ideological freeenterprisers the market right and religious fundamentalists the moral right buoyant optimists high on morning again in America and cynics fed up with Washington What brought them together was anger at high inflation and the humiliation of America by Iran resentment against big government and high taxes and frustration with Jimmy Carter Reagans successes  at cutting taxes boosting defense spending presiding over lower inflation and sustained economic growth  have eased the angers that glued his coalition together Moreover the Presidents problems with the IranContra scandal waste in the Pentagon and soaring deficits have created new frictions within his coalition Since 1984 Republican factions have clashed in Congress  over defense the deficit taxes abortion Social Security and handling Moscow Even the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H Bork was a painful source of fingerpointing among Republicans With his personal appeal and extraordinary skill at juggling conflicting interests the President has won unusual loyalty from his public constituencies But his personal chemistry cannot be handed on and the battle to succeed him is tearing the fabric of his coalition The Reagan coalition is different groups moving in different directions with tremendous potential for divisiveness observes Norman J Ornstein a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research a conservative think tank in Washington Reagan could simultaneously appeal to countryclub Republicans by pushing freemarket economics and keep the moral right happy with rhetoric on school prayer abortion busing even though he did not actually get that much done for them The next guy coming along has an awesome problem He is going to have great trouble turning the Reagan coalition into a Republican coalition ALL REPUBLICAN candidates label themselves conservatives these days but the term hides a world of differences The basic cleavage in the Republican Party is between the orthodox establishment wing and the ideological wing between the mainstream and the New Right  mainstream meaning affluent executives and suburban yuppies plus traditional Main Street Republicans from Middle America and the New Right meaning the ardent taxcutting economic right the religious right and the neoconservative antiCommunist right Of the six Presidential contenders Vice President Bush Robert Dole the Senate minority leader and former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr come from the establishment wing Robertson Representative Jack F Kemp of Buffalo and Pete du Pont former Governor of Delaware champion the ideological wing The Republican candidates fall into two camps over Reagans plans to sign an agreement with Moscow to eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles in Europe Bush applauds it Dole calls it a step in the right direction but Robertson Kemp du Pont and Haig attack it as a bad deal that leaves Europe inferior to Soviet conventional forces On the deficit Dole has backed a package that allows for some tax increases and cuts in defense spending Kemp and du Pont adamantly oppose tax increases But more than issues mark the candidates and their camps apart Values agendas philosophies of life social backgrounds all divide them Rarely have the polar opposites in style and substance been thrown into bolder relief than in backtoback speeches by Pat Robertson and George Bush in midSeptember at Iowa State University Robertson confident and charismatic set off a prairie fire with his ringing rolling messianic cadences calling for a crusade to restore the greatness of America through moral strength In his inspirational tenor the preacher proclaimed the yearnings of his grassroots legions They tell me in their view Communism is tyranny and they want for us to establish as the longrange goal of the United States of America the ultimate downfall of Communist tyranny throughout the world in every nation including the Soviet Union    And just as these people are saying we can never allow private choice to become the rationale for killing the elderly and the infirm we can no longer permit prochoice to be the rationale for the slaughter of 1 12 million unborn babies every year     His coda was a paean of patriotism appealing to that portion of the Reagan coalition for whom pride in country is paramount If were willing to work if were willing to sacrifice if were willing to dream Robertson promised then when we leave the legacy to our children and grandchildren we can say to them that when the torch of freedom was passed to us we kept it burning bright and we proudly present to you the greatest nation on the face of the earth the United States of America one nation under God Vice President Bush claimed a very different piece of Reagan  the personal link and the record His was a temperate establishment message a corporate chief telling his sales force that the company had had a good year and neednt fear a hostile takeover Bush was positive and sensible but bland and uninspired knowing one aide said that the audience had Gone South on him No mention of abortion school prayer Communist collapse or a ringing moral crusade For seven years he boasted I have stood side by side with one of the greatest Presidents    and Im very very proud Damn proud his advance text said but Bush cautiously toned it down To Bush the unfinished agenda spelled more economic growth and progress toward peace and the revival of traditional ethical standards meant fewer government appointees trying to turn a fast buck The Vice President namedropped about his personal dealings with Kohl Mitterrand Thatcher and Nakasone and talked constructively about making ethanol fuel from corn to help Iowa farmers setting up taxfree college savings bonds for parents and promoting remediation for the illiterate He clashed with Robertson on dealing with Moscow and this was before he got in hot water by saying that if Moscow had good tank mechanics they should send them to Detroit because we could use that kind of ability This evening Bush was especially proud of prospects for an arms agreement We have no higher calling he declared than to work for peace The Bush partisans cheered but they were no match for the passion of the Robertson crowd These speeches underscored the dramatic difference between what Republican Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia calls the managerial wing and the visionary wing of the party  one selling competence experience and electability the other playing to values and visions of the future For the Reagan coalition has its revisionists and its keepers of the flame  the moderate pragmatism of Bush and Dole versus the ideological fervor of Kemp Robertson du Pont each proclaiming a portion of Reaganite scripture In short the Republican battle of 1988 will decide whether the Reagan Revolution will get a new surge of fervor or dissolve into more traditional Republicanism Dole and Bush represent the preReagan party the side of the party Reagan had to beat to win Gingrich observes Kemp Robertson and du Pont represent the party that Reagan has created Eventually you will have a fight between the establishment and the ideological wings of the party agrees Doug Bailey copublisher of the Presidential Campaign Hot Line a daily political news summary If it doesnt happen before the convention itll happen at the convention IN SHEER NUMBERS the mainstream has a larger base among rankandfile Republicans than the ideological wing Obviously there are no precise boundaries but most strategists and polltakers reckon that 60 to 65 percent of Republicans are mainstream and about 35 to 40 percent fall into the ideological wing In most opinion polls of Republican voters Bush and Dole the leading mainstream candidates pull a combined total of 60 to 70 percent support with Bush ahead Wide public recognition helps each draw support within the ideological wing  Bush aided by ties with Reagan Dole by defending causes important to the moral right such as the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Bork This year moreover polls suggest that the electorate favors managerial leadership over visionary leadership I dont think theres a desire for a great new vision or new direction says Robert M Teeter Bushs polltaker People are generally satisfied with eight years of Reagan They want to know How do we build on it refine it Its a very resultsoriented electorate But if the establishment wing has the larger slice it is far from monolithic The world of traditional Republicans has regional and class differences and important differences in attitudes toward Reagan and the future As a Yale graduate and Texas oil entrepreneur George Bush is a quintessential establishment Republican He epitomizes both the oldline business Republicans from the Northeast and the newer Sunbelt Republican establishment  uppermiddleclass southerners who rode into the party in 1964 with Goldwater and every four years afterward Bob Doles political base is in the Middle West  farmers bankers smallbusinessmen people who have lately had a hard time making ends meet Dole is a master of Washington politics but he has made personal populism his campaign trademark At high schools in places like Newton Iowa Dole gives hearttoheart talks about his smalltown roots his brutal wounds in World War II his compassion for the little folk I was born in Russell Kan he recalled in Newton My mother sold sewing machines and taught sewing lessons My father ran a cream and egg station for 22 years Im one of four children the only one to get a college education because I had the GI Bill of Rights After the war and 39 months in hospitals Dole came home and was elected County Attorney Every month I had to look at all the people on the welfare list  and every month I found my grandparents there Robert G and Margaret Dole he said They were hardworking people tenant farmers and they couldnt make it    I tell you these things because theres a perception out there that we Republicans dont care about real people Oh we like the countryclub set but we dont have time for someone with real problems That perceptions not accurate I am one candidate and there may be others who has never forgotten where Im from or how I got where I am Doles pitch strikes home in Iowa farm country But Dole like Bush conveys more than regional and class identity Each has a subliminal message that points to a more basic rift in the Reagan coalition Bush wraps himself in Reagans legacy Dole takes an independent course Bush plays to the optimists content with the nations situation Dole to the pessimists who worry about deficits foreign competition and their own financial future Al Haig is another Republican contender given to blunt talk about the nations problems He praises Reagan for restoring the nations pride but attacks Republican deficits and Reagans economic policies especially for giving cold turkey to the American farmer Haig attracts interest from uneasy establishment Republicans and moderates mainly in the Northeast but he has yet to challenge the leaders In the battle for mainstream support Bush remains ahead of Dole in organization and fund raising 125 million to 8 million As of now he is better armed to withstand one or two early losses and to tackle Super Tuesday the oneday 20state primary contest next March 8 But polls show Dole catching up If either Bush or Dole becomes the clear mainstream favorite by midMarch he will either have cinched the nomination or have gotten a long leg up If they battle evenly through next spring however it could create an opening for a longshot ideological candidate So far neither Bush nor Dole stirs grassroots excitement and passionate commitment giving dark horses a chance to spurt THE VISIONARY wing is where Republican fire and brimstone burn brightly where issues arouse passions and the passions of true believers can sometimes overwhelm more complacent mainstream Republicans Militant minorities can magnify their power Continued on Page 42 in the primary and caucus process where Republican turnout in key states like Iowa and New Hampshire runs only 100000 to 150000 The establishment wing has an advantage of say 60 percent to 40 percent says the publisher Doug Bailey but those arent the numbers that participate in primaries If the ideological conservatives energize their voters the split could be 5050 or in the South even 4060 the other way Like the mainstream wing however the Republican right is no ones monopoly It has serious rifts mainly between the market right of antigovernment freeenterprisers and the moral right of Protestant evangelicals and Catholic righttolifers The market right is often turned off by the moral rights attacks on feminism abortion and school textbooks Many in the moral right care little about economic policy and favor some Government programs For a decade the market right has been the main terrain of Jack Kemp the exuberant apostle of boundless economic growth through massive tax cuts Crusading for an American renaissance Kemp competes with Bush for Republican optimists What a great moment this is to be living Kemp trumpeted recently in Orlando Fla He lashes Democrats for claiming it is midnight in America And he projects his own bountiful vistas of full employment without inflation jobs and freeenterprise zones from sea to shining sea He envisions even smokestack states revitalized by global prosperity born of free trade Kemp claims he can hold two new elements of the Reagan coalition under30 Republicans and ethnic bluecollar Democrats But his candidacy illustrates the problems of keeping the Reagan coalition intact Hardcore conservatives dislike Kemps support for sanctions against South Africa and for righttowork laws and his opposition to a constitutional amendment to balance the budget They wince at his talk of a progressive conservative radical revolutionary Lincoln emancipation party with appeal in union halls and urban ghettos In trying to broaden his appeal Kemp has offended part of the Reagan base To compensate Kemp has fallen back on a staple of the ideological wing  fierce antiCommunism This fall Kemp has swung to the right of Reagan warning against a peace sellout in Central America and a weak arms deal with Moscow delighting neoconservatives Haig too has played to the antiCommunist right calling himself the best equipped to stand toe to toe with Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev Within the freemarket right Kemp has been outflanked by Pete du Pont who is an even more ardent economic libertarian Du Pont wants the 26 billion farm subsidy program phased out welfare recipients made to work and highschool students drugtested to qualify for drivers licenses He attacks Dole for defending farm subsidies and Kemp for backing Social Security and aid to education Du Ponts hottest support is on college campuses where he hooks interest with one key question If you think Social Security is going to be there when you retire raise your hand Few hands go up Du Ponts pitch is a subsidized privatesector savings option to Social Security BUT THE MOST STUNning new figure in the ideological wing is Robertson because he entered the race with a huge political base from his 200millionayear Christian Broadcasting Network and the 14 million regular viewers of his 700 Club program Robertson told me he reckoned some 20 million Republican voters are evangelicals  bornagain Christians I would need only a third of that nationwide to win the nomination he said The last Republican nomination race in 1980 attracted 127 million primary voters Pollsters and strategists for other candidates contend that Robertson exaggerates the size of the evangelical movement and his ability to unite it But all agree that evangelicals the core of the moral right have been the most potent bloc of voters to shift into the Republican column in the Reagan era and they expect Robertson to bring in still more Robertson has shown striking ability to generate enthusiasm and active support using fundamentalist churches to organize He claims 33 million people signed petitions urging him to run And by his account he has raised close to 11 million spending more than 6 million on fundraising itself to finance a paid staff of 104 working in 20 states Son of the late Senator A Willis Robertson of Virginia Robertson has a feel for politics a flair for the dramatic He won the Michigan precinct caucuses in August 1986 and in alliance with Kemp took over the state party committee he showed precinctlevel strength in South Carolina and then won the Iowa Republican straw poll in September Robertson has been quietly laying groundwork for his Presidential run for six years In 1981 he set up the Freedom Council a nowdefunct nonprofit organization that spent 4 million to 5 million a year to recruit and involve Christian fundamentalists in the political process Already Robertson speaks of Kemp as the junior partner in their alliance against Bush and the mainstream Robertson argues that if he proves himself a viable candidate he will pull support from Kemp and others  from righttowork and righttolife groups guncontrol advocates the Conservative Caucus a mass organization of rightwing activists and the staunchly antiCommunist Council for National Policy Robertsons big hurdle is the high negative reaction he stirs among many voters He concedes resistance even among Christian fundamentalists to a clergyman running for President Establishment Republicans complain about his sermonizing about family values and womens place in the home Black and gay hecklers chanting Bigot Bigot and carrying placards Robertson and Khomeini in 88 disrupted his campaign announcement in New Yorks BedfordStuyvesant on Oct 1 He was quickly engulfed in controversy over alleged embellishments in his political resume and over his hiding the fact that he was married just 10 weeks before the birth of his first child Robertson admitted sowing wild oats when young before his bornagain experience  but denied other charges And he has taken steps to gain political legitimacy He has stopped hosting television broadcasts and resigned as head of his broadcasting network In market tests he has softened negative reactions with advertisements playing up his role as educator businessman Korean War veteran and international statesman working on famine relief Probably the most severe backlash will come if Robertson actually wins the caucuses in states like Michigan and Iowa next January and February and begins to emerge as the champion of the ideological wing I dont think hell get the nomination but hell be so strong that hell scare the establishment Republicans to coalesce around one candidate Bush or Dole says Doug Bailey They will fear the splinter in their own ranks could lead to a Robertson nomination and that is a horrifying thing to them Win or lose Robertson and his moral right movement represent a potentially divisive force for the Reagan coalition Given Robertsons funding organization and political base other Republican campaigns expect him to win 20 percent or more of the Republican delegates That would give him bargaining power comparable to what the Rev Jesse Jackson is likely to have at the Democratic convention  power to pull the party nominee and platform to the right as Jackson may push the Democrats to the left If Robertson were to impose tough demands on the nominee and platform some mainstream Republican strategists fear this could drive away moderate Democrats and independent voters in the general election As Dole and Kemp keep reminding Republican audiences a Republican nominee cannot win the Presidency without support from independent voters and Democrats To try to perpetuate the Reagan coalition the Republicans can work basic themes of peace and prosperity if the 60month economic recovery holds up and popular arms agreements are signed with Moscow But the hard right may fight the arms agreements and Robertsons push points to other internal tensions Ultimately says Kevin Phillips a veteran Republican analyst the ineptitude of Democrats may drive feuding Republican factions together Theres no Republican who can hold the Reagan coalition together he remarks But the Democrats are doing silly things that take peoples minds off jobs the economy and foreign competition With their lack of talent and their fratricide the Democrats are holding the Republicans together
NASSAU EXECUTIVE CANDIDATES CONFRONT THE ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/25/nyregion/nassau-executive-candidates-confront-the-issues.html,OFTEN agreeing on the problems but not the solutions the Republican and Democratic candidates for Nassau County Executive clashed last week over a wide variety of issues At a debate at The New York Times Thomas S Gulotta the County Executive and Raymond B Grunewald his Democratic challenger sparred on such issues as garbage traffic housing and publicly financed mailings by Mr Gulotta The two appeared with two minor party candidates  Dr Raymond J Vuolo of the RighttoLife Party and Jack Olchin of the Liberal Party The candidates sat next to one another across the table from a panel of Times reporters and editors Mr Grunewald a former Federal

opening of the Shoreham nuclear plant and supporting a takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company by the Long Island Power Authority They also agreed that the environment particularly clean water is a priority issue and that abortions should not be banned at the County Medical Center Both said there was no evidence of organized crime infiltration or control of the garbage carting industry which is booming on Long Island because of the transfer of garbage upstate and to other states The 43yearold Mr Gulotta a proven votegetter backed by one of the strongest political organizations in the country a 3to2 Republican enrollment edge and the Conservative Party is considered a strong favorite over the 59yearold Mr Grunewald a former Federal prosecutor who lost by a large margin to County Comptroller Peter King two years ago Perhaps the most heated exchange came on the issue of housing for the elderly and for young people Mr Gulotta said that as Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead until earlier this year and as County Executive he had sponsored housing programs that included home equity loans that the elderly could use for new condominiums two developments with up to 300 units and a new program to transfer county lands to municipalities willing to build housing Mr Grunewald responded that in Hempstead alone there is a 7000person waiting list for the pathetically few housing units the town had sponsored This is just the old stultifying attitude that somehow or other the problem will go away he said The two strongly disagreed on the countys role in garbage disposal with Mr Grunewald arguing that the county through an authority should build a recycling plant that would dispose of up to 65 percent of the countys refuse with a goal of 100 percent disposal Mr Gulotta argued that garbage disposal is essentially a town and city responsiblity with the county providing supplemental help He said it was preposterous to rely on recycling alone Mr Gulotta often referring to handprinted index cards on a variety of subjects was most detailed in outlining his program for growing traffic congestion in Nassau County He said he would spend 28 million to reconstruct major intersections in the county 26 million to repair buses 15 million for more parking at railroad stations and an unspecified amount for synchronizing traffic lights on major county arteries Mr Grunewald emphasized the need for a northsouth railroad in the county and Mr Gulotta seized on that to challenge Mr Grunewald to specify where he would build the rail line so that all communities can be aware that the routes will be traveling northsouth in their areas He said that the problem should have been handled with foresight 15 to 20 years ago Only Mr Grunewald was critical of four mailings sent to Nassau County residents by Mr Gulotta at county expense a campaign technique being used even more extensively by the Acting Suffolk County Executive Michael A LoGrnde Mr Grunewald said the mailings were purely political literature that was costing the taxpayers close to 500000 He ridiculed one piece of literature on hurricanes as absolute nonsense adding that it advised Nassau residents to call the police emergency number in case of a hurricane problem Mr Gulotta said that four brochures were legitimate government mailings that cost 45000 Mr Grunewald has asked the State Commission on Integrity in Government to investigate the mailings Although both candidates and Dr Vuolo opposed Shoreham Mr Grunewald criticized Mr Gulotta as a latecomer to the issue That touched off one of the few sharp remarks by Mr Gulotta who called the Grunewald criticism an outright lie Mr Gulotta was ambivalent on the proposed Power Authority takeover He said he would proceed extremely cautiously because it would dramatically increase the cost upon taxpayers He added that nevertheless he expected a takeover by the Power Authority It seems to me that would be the most beneficial result he said Asked about their priorities for the county Mr Gulotta said he wanted to preserve the suburban way of life through water conservation open space programs and affordable housing Mr Grunewald said he wanted to establish a meaningful twoparty system in the county to eliminate politics from water and garbage management and to cut up to 200 million in political patronage from the county payroll Dr Vuolo said he wanted to end the disgrace of our county  2500 abortions a year at the Nassau County Medical Center 1000 of them paid for by Medicaid Mr Olchin who holds a patronage post as an assistant county attorney and who often praised and defended Mr Gulotta during the debate said he favored creation of a county legislature and town councilmanic districts to give representation to nonRepublicans Nassau Republican have consistently opposed such a move
"SCHOOLS, CITING NEED, ADD HEALTH CLINICS TO SERVICES",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/25/nyregion/schools-citing-need-add-health-clinics-to-services.html,LEAD THE days of the school nurse working alone in a dingy back office and armed with little more than a thermometer are quickly disappearing in schools across Connecticut THE days of the school nurse working alone in a dingy back office and armed with little more than a thermometer are quickly disappearing in schools across Connecticut Several middle schools and high schools today have clinics on school grounds with doctors and nurse practitioners ready to diagnose illnesses and to prescribe and dispense medication Some schools also offer pregnancy testing and psychological counseling for students services health officials say are badly needed If you look at the national data adolescents are the one group medically underserved at this point said Lynn Noyes public health social work consultant for the State Department of Health Services It used to be the elderly Ms Noyes who oversees the planning and opening of schoolbased clinics in Connecticut said that although some students do seek care or advice on sexual issues many more were looking for help with emotional problems Im not talking about kids who are crazy she said Im talking about people who are struggling with serious problems in their lives such as child abuse and neglect violence in girlfriendboyfriend relationships drug and alcohol problems depression anxiety suicide Ms Noyes said schoolbased clinics were only now beginning to spread in public schools in Connecticut for two reasons the state was offering larger subsidies to plan and operate the clinics and local school boards had been assured that the clinics would not prescribe or dispense contraceptives or provide abortion referrals Students also need their parents permission to use the clinics New Haven and Bridgeport each have two clinics Meriden hopes to open a schoolbased clinic in the late spring or early fall New London will open a health clinic at its junior high school in January A regional clinic is being planned to serve northeastern Connecticut students Windham is expected to open a clinic for its high school students next year And the cities of New Britain Middletown and Stamford are beginning to work on plans for clinics in their schools The clinics have had such bad press because it focused on familyplanning services Ms Noyes said But now people can see the kids are flocking to the doors with mental healthrelated problems not reproductiverelated health problems The clinic at the Quirk Middle School in Hartford opens this month and will offer pregnancy testing and psychological counseling for the schools seventh and eighth graders Were finding too many of the youngsters are being identified as being pregnant when they are six months along said the assistant coordinator of health services and health education for the Hartford Board of Education Leah Fichtner The school is hoping that the availability of pregnancy testing on school grounds will mean that young girls will receive prenatal care earlier which could ultimately mean healthier babies Hartford like many other Connecticut cities is struggling with the unhappy distinction of having one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the country The chief cause health experts say is low birth weight And teenage mothers they say are at a high risk of having smaller babies The clinic at Quirk is a pilot program for the city and if the Quirk clinic succeeds one being planned at Hartford High School would be opened Although Hartford unlike most communities has long had diagnostic and treatment services available to students this is the first time a concentrated effort will be made to prevent health problems Ms Fichtner said Quirk was selected for the first schoolbased clinic in the city because it serves the poorest population in the city Ms Fichtner said The school she said manifests varying degrees of all of the problems found in innercity schools such as teenage pregnancy a high number of singleparent households poverty and a high dropout rate The school which has an enrollment of 1200 students serves a largely Hispanic population The medical community came to us and said We need your help We dont have access to the kids Youre trying to keep the kids in school but you cant do that unless you meet their health needs  Ms Fichtner said Besides getting young girls into prenatal care earlier she said the school hopes to decrease the dropout rate by helping troubled students Funds will be available to hire an administrator for the clinic and a counselor and to add more nursing time A lot of our kids dont see a future for themselves Ms Fichtner said We cant change the poverty but we can help the kids with their selfesteem and what they see for themselves Others who see the possibilities in schoolbased clinics are private foundations which helped begin a clinic program for students in Bridgeport several years ago and Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance which has contributed about 40000 toward the Quirk experiment We really thought long and hard about it said the director of public relations for Phoenix Mutual Joanne Leventhal One of the issues at first was whether the schoolbased clinic would give pelvic exams The school board decided against it About the pregnancy testing Phoenix decided its better to know about it and get them into a program of good health than not to know she said Bridgeport has two clinics one in each of its two high schools Both offer pregnancy testing and one Bassick High School has day care in school and offers clinic services for the infants as well as their mothers The other clinic is at Harding High School The clinics were started because of the rising incidence of adolescent pregnancy said the director of the Council on Adolescent Pregnancy for the city of Bridgeport Geraldine Johnson It interferes with attendance achievement Its having a ripple effect through society Ms Johnson said about half of the roughly 1000 students at each high school use the clinic services Many use them for their sports physicals or a variety of services such as help with acne and weight problems The high schools she said still use the services of a school nurse whose position is required by law The nurse takes care of students health records and refers those who need further care to the clinic In New Haven a clinic was opened at the Jackie Robinson Middle School a year ago Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven has had a clinic for six years Like the Bridgeport school clinics the nurse practitioners and doctors in the New Haven school clinics work closely with medical staffs at neighborhood clinics The supervisor of sciencehealth for the New Haven school system Robert Conte said the clinics helped reduce the rate of absenteeism because students could get help with their medical problems on school grounds instead of taking a day off to see a family doctor or to wait to see someone in the clinic or hospital emergency room Also he said many students are getting medical care who otherwise may only rarely see a doctor Although there are no statistics available for the Wilbur Cross clinic figures for the Jackie Robinson clinic show twothirds of the schools 587 students signed up for medical services last year They are coming to us for a first source of treatment for what are some pretty serious problems said the planning coordinator for the citys schoolbased clinics Margaret Cornell Most of the kids here dont have an ongoing relationship with a health care provider they can call for emergencies Pregnancy testing is available at the Jackie Robinson school but Ms Cornell said none of the students had yet used the service School officials said about onethird of the students who used the Jackie Robinson clinic were covered by Medicaid Another third have a private insurer through their parents employers and the remaining third have parents who work but do not receive medical benefits
EXCERPTS FROM THE DEBATE BY NASSAU CANDIDATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/25/nyregion/excerpts-from-the-debate-by-nassau-candidates.html,FOLLOWING are excerpts from a debate among the four candidates for Nassau County Executive Thomas S Gulotta RepublicanConservative Raymond B Grunewald Democrat Jack Olchin Liberal and Dr Raymond J Vuolo RighttoLife Party The candidates were questioned by reporters and editors at The New York Times Shoreham Q Suffolk and New York State have taken the lead in opposition to the opening of the Shoreham plant What should Nassau Countys position be GULOTTA I view the Shoreham plant as any other mechanical device When you purchase a mechanical device you want to know that its designed to accomplish the objectives for which it was established Specifically with the Shoreham plant you want to know that it is safe that there is a safe evacuation plan and that it can do what it was designed to do and that is to provide sufficient energy needs for the future and at the same time ameliorate the rate increases which weve been experiencing At the present time no safe evacuation plan has been filed in compliance with the law To that extent we have to rely upon Suffolk County and the State of New York and the Federal Government Until such time as a safe evacuation plan is filed which I do not believe can be accomplished by virtue of the geographic configuration I do not support the opening of that facility OLCHIN I am for Shoreham And ultimately on a 100 percent operation with power I think that Long Island is going to need that power GRUNEWALD Well Im glad to see that Mr Gulotta has finally seen the light although I suspect it is more from political motivation than sincerity I question sincerity because of two years ago when I together with John Matthews campaigned vigorously against the opening of Shoreham and against the concept of having a nuclear power plant at Shoreham which presents to me a great threat to the populace that there are no safe and sane methods of evacuation it was Mr Gulotta who sat as the Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead and as the vice chairman of the Board of Supervisors and it was he who blithely endorsed the then Republican machine philosophy that Shoreham was in fact a matter that should be left best to those who knew better namely Lilco I would point out to you that their concept of safety that is the utilization of the Nassau Coliseum where they were going to provide people with HandiWipes and an instant plastic device to clean off their cars It was a project conceived in foolishness and ultimately it was driven from the scene by the sheer weight of political thought mainly that people were opposed VUOLO Im not against all nuclear plants unequivocally but I have not seen a safe evacuation plan for Shoreham and considering the geographic locale I cant visualize how one could be formulated GULOTTA Mr Grunewalds response is nothing less than an outright lie I have never supported Lilcos position with regard to Shoreham nor have I supported Lilco with regard to that rate increase request and formulated consortiums against it In point of fact we have proceeded with Suffolk County in a lawsuit to make sure that Lilco complies with the law in every respect with regard to Shoreham and cannot bypass local authority It was the Nassau County Board of Supervisors when I was vice chairman of that board that halted Lilco from using the Coliseum as an evacuation site It was during the period I was Presiding Supervisor and vice chairman of the Board of Supervisors that we prevented Lilco from establishing three separate sites in each of the three towns for evacuation centers And so the statement is either totally inaccurate or from lack of knowledge GRUNEWALD I dont think its from either lack of knowledge or inaccurate Youre telling me about post1985 when the issue had become a burning issue you might say And it turns out that what you now accuse me of saying is incorrect It was quite correct when the issues were the real issues of an election It is only since that time that things have changed and you have taken a position now consistent with reality For that I am grateful Lilco Takeover Q Do you think that the Long Island Power Authority should take over Lilco GULOTTA I would proceed extremely cautiously LIPA is in the process now of completing its review and will be submitting additional recommendations with regard to the takeover of Shoreham And Ive talked individually to some of the members of the Long Island Power Authority It seems to me that whenever government becomes involved in the operation of the private sector you run certain risks And that it will dramatically increase the cost upon taxpayers However I would suggest to you that I do expect that the ultimate outcome will be that LIPA will take over the Shoreham facility and it seems to me that that would be the most beneficial result GRUNEWALD I believe that the Long Island Power Authority is something that I campaigned for with John Matthews in 1985 And Im on record as having been in favor of it that time even prior to its formulation I believe it is the solution Lilco has a dismal track record as an operating facility not in terms of its laborers or the people that work there but in terms of its management OLCHIN Until we get sufficient figures from the Long Island Power Authority to substantiate their claims there should be no takeover VUOLO Im against the Long Island Power Authority taking over Lilcos operation because its been my experience and the track record shows that as soon as you have governmental intervention in this type of industry all the inefficiencies that commonly occur with a governmental takeover will be present here Biggest Problem Q What is the most serious problem facing the county and why do you think Republican administrations in the past havent done anything about it OLCHIN I think the critical issue for Nassau County is that we must have a County Legislature so that the members of the Legislature work on a fulltime basis on behalf of the county GRUNEWALD I believe that the way were going to have to go at it is through the establishment of a Nassau County water authority to deal with what I believe is an absolute crisis in our water in Nassau County both in quality and in quantity I believe we have to clean up our act with respect to decontaminants that are in the water Im most concerned about the reports concerning cancerous materials that are infiltrating down into our water system I understand from the report made five years ago that Nassau County is in the top 10 percentile in cancer overall and it has the unpleasant but horrifying statistic of being the leading habitat of breast cancer not only in the State of New York but in the United States VUOLO The most important issue for me is the abortion issue in Nassau County We have a County Medical Center that performs 2500 abortions per year One thousand of those are Medicaidfunded and I might say illegally so Medicaid funds are earmarked for medically necessary abortions and these are abortions of convenience that are being performed This is costing the Nassau taxpayer about 500000 in Nassau funds per year and another 500000 in state funds per year GULOTTA One of the most serious problems we face is with regard to the question of the environment This year under this administration  my administration  we established historic laws with regard to water conservation water management program which is designed not only to conserve water but also to deal with the question of water quality We anticipate that we are going to be able to exceed our goals in that regard and we are now undertaking extensive education programs in the schools and with the adult community In addition we established historic legislation with regard to open space to preserve forever wild that acreage that exists in the county Weve already acquired certain acreage we are reviewing other acreage I have established an environmental law bureau in the county to pursue those who would violate the laws of the environment OLCHIN Im for a constitutional amendment so that counties can vote housing A county is precluded under the state constitution from building housing GULOTTA My administration is not new to the question of the environment The creation of an authority would only be another layer of government It would be more costly and nonresponsive to the taxpayers We shouldnt avoid our responsibilities as elected officials to deal with these crucial issues People elect us to deal with the issues and its our responsibility My administration is doing that VUOLO Id like to know what Mr Gulottas response is to the situation in the Nassau County Medical Center as far as abortions are concerned to the accusation I just made that Medicaid funds are being illegally used And Id like to know what his position would be if we could prove that from a legal point of view he could stop abortions in the Nassau County Medical Center GULOTTA I have met with in fact representatives of those who have expressed concern consistent with the righttolife issue and have indicated that the County of Nassau and all of its component parts including the Nassau County Medical Center are going to comply strictly with the law That is our mandate and that is exactly what we shall do GRUNEWALD Im in favor of what we call freedom of choice I believe that this is a matter of personal conscience And I for one would never superimpose my views in such a matter upon anyone I respect Mr Vuolos right to say what he says but I dont agree with his concept if it imposes upon anyone and particularly upon women who have to bear unnecessary and unwanted children Q Would you go along with what Mr Grunewald just said about abortion GULOTTA I am personally opposed to abortion but the county will comply with the laws as established by the Federal and state governments Housing Q Could you just basically assess the countys record on trying to create or facilitate affordable housing in the county and what should be done GRUNEWALD This has been one of the pillars of my campaign when I campaigned countywide and pointed out to all and sundry that the county desperately needs to get into the act and help out our senior citizens and our young people who are voting with their feet Theyre leaving this county Were not going to have a workforce And the county has doggedly refused to get involved GULOTTA As Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead weve dramatically increased the housing units for senior citizens basically through the use of federally funded grants When Federal funds dried up we developed an innovative program of permitting senior citizens to utilize the untapped equity in their homes to purchase some more affordable senior citizen condominiums and to bank the balance which in turn permitted them to pay for all the carrying charges on their new homes and to use the balance for their own personal needs Garbage Q What do you think the county role should be in garbage disposal Is it a town responsibility Can it be sold to Islip Is the deadline on the landfilling appropriate VUOLO I think the countys role should be to establish efficient safe incineration of garbage Theres just no place to put the garbage anymore and that garbage barge is a perfect example Efficient incineration and not the type of plant that was built in North Hempstead That plant was built by a company Parsons  Whitmore which was in the paper pulp business and their entire mentality toward incineration was a pulp mentality GULOTTA Right now the county provides 32 million a year to the three towns and two cities specifically for purposes of taking care of their solid waste management programs So we are lending support We have also established a uniform recylcing program Weve located a county property put a county building on it and are offering it for the uniform countywide program to all municipalities in the county to recycle What does that do It reduces the waste stream it removes materials from the waste stream that could be hazardous for incineration and landfilling And it reduces the cost because whether a munipality ships or incinerates or landfills the costs per ton  by reducing the tonnage you reduce the cost upon the taxpayers The county cannot legally overtake the solid waste disposal issues of the three towns and two cities and Ill tell you why At this very moment the Town of Hempstead has a 350 million binding contract with bonds that have already been let to build that plant And what would happen to the taxpayers if that happened if indeed the county sought to disrupt that existing binding contract And all of the three municipalities  the three towns and the two cities  are in the same position In fact Glen Cove already has an incinerator on line Long Beach will have an incinerator on line shortly North Hempstead is in the environmental process and Oyster Bay is in a similar situation OLCHIN I cant possibly suggest anything beyond what the County Executive is doing and I applaud what hes doing GRUNEWALD I dont applaud him for what hes doing because first of all the county can take over the towns obligations with respect to garbage I advocate the creation of a countywide waste disposal authority staffed not with politicians but with professionals and engineers to operate and using the sanitary district as collection points to eliminate the political boondoggles that we have seen the waste of taxpayers money with these endless repetitions of government and the inefficient manner in which the garbage situation has been handled Its a county responsibility and we wouldnt have the garbage mountains if we had had a viable garbagedisposal program in effect even as late as five years ago GULOTTA My opponent has not answered your question at all He talks about creating an authority in order to control local sanitation districts Local sanitation districts do nothing but pick up the garbage I have yet to hear him say how the garbage will be disposed of and that is the issue at hand In point of fact he opposes the existence of landfills as do I GRUNEWALD I am an advocate of recycling I believe the public has to be educated I think real recycling programs have to be put into effect unlike the one in the Town of North Hempstead which has been demonstrated is nothing more than a farce They put out these little buckets so everybody can separate their garbage but when it goes down to the place where its to be supposedly recycled they dumped it all together and trucked it away at great expense to the county GULOTTA Id like to ask the same question What do you do with the garbage aside from discussing politics What is your answer to the removal of the garbage GRUNEWALD I believe in American ingenuity I believe that we can recycle And I believe recycling can do up to 65 to 70 percent of the garbage and turn it into something far more useful than fly ash Traffic Q Traffic congestion has become worse and worse What kind of solutions would you propose solutions dealing with the car or is mass transit still an option for the Island GULOTTA I have indicated that Im proposing a 28 million bond issue in Nassau County to deal with the major intersections within the county that we consider to be the most hazardous and most dangerous intersections Included within the 28 million bond issue is renovation of vehicular and pedestrian bridges cuts in curbs for the disabled and handicapped synchronization and repair of all of the traffic lights in county so that people can move smoothly at a specific rate of speed The issue of joining together with Suffolk County  earlier this year we were able to attain an additional 150 million from the State of New York for care of state roadways in the NassauSuffolk region Further with regard to mass transit I have  we have been able to obtain 15 million for an additional 716 parking spaces at the Farmingdale Wantagh and Seaford railroad station parking to encourage mass transit And 26 million in the budget that Im proposing which is designed to repair the buses over a twoyear period So again to encourage people to use mass transit GRUNEWALD The trouble with Mr Gulottas approach is that he lacks the imagination to understand what the real problems are in Nassau County Nassau County has been traditionally geared to running traffic east and west because of the Long Island Rail Road existing rail facilities Theres no way that were going to run transportation that way anymore Take a good look at whats going on in Nassau County Businesses and people are running north and south and the traffic lines are enormous I know because I live near Northern Boulevard and you can see the lines going in and out We need an innovative approach that looks for a light rail transportation system connecting our areas of congestion together Get people accustomed to getting away from the automobile GULOTTA A lot of what were talking about today could have been avoided with some foresight 15 or 20 years ago when development was coming about And I would agree that we need northsouth routes in Nassau and indeed in Suffolk County We recognize that as a problem and I would challenge my opponent to come up with exactly where those routes are going to go on a northsouth basis so that all communities can be aware that the routes will be traveling northsouth in their area Stock Market Q What will be the effect of the stock market slide on Nassau Government securities GULOTTA Were doing what is necessary to protect ourselves In fact I met for four hours with the County Comptroller to discuss this very issue as the stock market unfortunately was plummeting I would just point out that in the late 70s when the stock market was not doing well Nassau County continued to maintain a very strong economy and we catapaulted to even greater success as the economy picked up on a nationwide basis Its impossible to predict what the outcome may be with regard to the national economy or the national stock market but there are factors to be considered And were watching it very carefully There clearly would be an effect upon the sales tax revenues However if a decline in the economy nationally means that there would be an increase in inflation as bad as that would sound that in turn would increase sales tax revenues to the county So there might be a side benefit in that regard GRUNEWALD My concerns are similar to Mr Gulottas because anyone thats going to be in charge of running a county has to be concerned about its ability to produce borrowing power My concerns are over several decades of environmental neglect Im afraid this may have a horrifying impact if it turns out with respect to certain areas of Nassau that residents there are unfortunately sitting upon a version of Love Canal Thats something that we should have taken care of when we had the bucks to spend It wasnt done it needs to be done Public Mail Q Mr Gulotta has been sending an unprecedented amount of publicly financed mail And its much far more than his predecessor ever did and its all coming in an election year just before his election I want to see whether you think that is ethical OLCHIN This is not political in any manner shape or form as far as Im concerned This is the County Executive acting as the top official in Nassau County informing the population the electorate what he is doing And it is perfectly proper If I was the County Executive believe me my name would be on each and every piece GRUNEWALD It isnt the fact that the County Executive is entitled to put his name or imprimatur upon the proper material Thats not the question at all The county has spent close to half a million dollars both in terms of cost and the labor on the purely political literature One of the classic examples is that one piece thats absolute nonsense It talks about warning people about hurricanes Strangely enough it came out just before the election The hurricane warning it said call 911 if you really have a problem How clever How necessary is that But its important because Mr Gulottas name is mentioned at least a half a dozen times and his picture and all this useless information is right there GULOTTA Every one of the mailings he has referred to is a legitimate governmental mailing with a legitimate governmental purpose Indeed approximately 45000 was spent with regard to the four mailings that have been referred to The balance is Industrial Development Agency money which is not taxpayer dollars Consequently we have been able to accrue savings of some 15 million in taxpayer dollars And if we can spend a few thousand to properly inform our residents I have done that in the past and Im going to do it again And what brochures are we talking about Were talking a water conservation brochure which is an educational brochure necessary to inform our residents of exactly what the water conservatiion rules and regulations are Were talking about a veterans mailing to acquire the approval of the Veterans Administration for purposes of a healthrelated facility at the Medical Center which they have denied And we have in excess of 12000 positive responses on that petition to demonstrate that there is a need for such a facility Were talking about a senior citizen mailing to notify senior citizens with regard to healthrelated programs for which there are time limits within which they must apply Were talking about a hurricane brochure which by the way was devised by a Federal agency and in conjunction with them It was distributed when Mr Grunewald is not aware September happens to be hurricane season So we distributed it prior to that time Master Plan Q Mr Gulotta youve said you have no master plan for your own political future What master plan do you have for the county if youre elected GULOTTA One of the key elements of this administation is to plan for the future for 5 10 15 20 25 from today because we are looking to preserve the elements of suburban life which happens to be important to many of us not just for ourselves but for our children and our future generations And that is the very basis of the water conservation program that is indeed the basis for the open space forever wild program that is the very basis for the coordinating efforts from local municipalities where we are reaching agreements with New York for affordable housing for young couples and our senior citizens OLCHIN I think it would be critical that there must be an establishment of a county legislature a council district so that there can be minority representation on the county legislature and within the county We do not have it now There are pockets of minorities that if they have their own district youll get that repesentation GRUNEWALD I think Mr Olchin speaks well for Mr Gulotta I have campaigned hard and vigorously for the restoration of what will actually be the creation of a viable twoparty system in Nassau County a party system of government which will be responsible to the public one which will be intereted in more than lip service on the issues of housing for our senior citizens and our young people  a party that will be interested And my political philosophy is the creation of a viable government one which will do things for the public an active government an imaginative government one with innovation imagination and something that will be done for the public day in and day out VUOLO I think that the disgrace of our county is the fact that there are 2500 babies killed every year in our Nassau County hospital with the cost to Nassau County taxpayers of over a half a million dollars The county hospital has the most liberal abortion policy around You can walk in off the street any woman and they can have an abortion at the Nassau County Medical Center The Republican Party much to its disgrace has failed to adopt the national Republican platform against abortion The Liberal Party stands for abortion as does the Democratic Party Mr Gulotta states that he is personally against abortion but he cant hide behind that If he were against slavery and slavery was the law of the land Im sure he would speak out and use his office against it
Is the South Again Democratic?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/26/opinion/is-the-south-again-democratic.html,LEAD We lost this nomination on Nov 4 1986 We lost this nomination on Nov 4 1986 Those familiar words by a tactician for Judge Robert H Bork who was recalling the election reflected one painful reality of the stunning turnaround on the Supreme Court nomination That is the decisive influence of united black opposition to Judge Bork on Southern Democratic Senators and by extension the new power of the black vote in the South Democrats exhilarated by their impending victory hope that they can extend the pattern into Southern electoral votes in 1988 Can Democrats map a road to the White House in 1988 on the foundation of the Southern black vote The fact that the Democrats gained a majority in the Senate on the strenght of five Southern victories that those triumphs were built on the solid base of black Demoratic support and that black political activity has given the Democrats their greatest symbolic triumph in recent years would certainly suggest that they could So too would recent evidence from census data and a recent Times MirrorGallup survey that blacks have become politically activated Poor blacks for example now register and vote in greater proportions than comparably poor whites But a word of caution is in order Successes in 1986 notwithstanding the Democratic Party has an uphill climb It will take a delicate balancing act beginning now and continuing through the 1988 general election campaign to win Southern electoral votes The Democrats problems are twofold They must keep Southern black voters  who represent many different values and outlooks  excited enough about the party and eager enough for a change so that their political activity continues unabated But that is not enough Even if several Southern Democratic Senators got elected with a minority of the white vote the partys hold on that minority is fragile enough that it would take precious few additional defections from white Southerners to create GOP heaven  regardless of the course of the black vote The black Democratic vote in the South is a reality Blacks of all backgrounds and persuasions remain firmly Democratic and are voting in increasing numbers But a heavy black turnout in 1988 is no certainty The Times MirrorGallup study found that blacks are heavily represented in at least 5 of 11 separate and distinct voter groups in the electorate There are sharp issue and value differences among blacks across these groups  over social issues like abortion and over such questions as a strong defense Regardless of these differences however roughly 55 percent of blacks in each of the five categories support the Presidential campaign of the Rev Jesse Jackson Blacks across the spectrum will vote Democratic But how the Democratic Party handles these issues and how the party manages to deal with Mr Jackson will have a lot to do with how many of these Southern blacks turn out to vote A sense that the party is in disarray over its positions or a sense that it is maneuvering to shut out Mr Jackson or derail his campaign would keep black turnout down enough to make a real and painful difference Dealing with these issues and with Mr Jackson however will not go unnoticed by Southern whites They too will watch how Democratic candidates deal with Mr Jackson in debates how the party deals with him at the convention and how the Democratic nominee relates to him in the general election campaign If Mr Jackson is treated with kid gloves in debates lionized at the convention or  worst of all  if there is any hint of future commitments to Mr Jackson in exchange for his support these white voters will stream into Republican ranks Democrats managed to capture the close Senate seats in 1986 because several categories of Southern Democratic whites particularly Southern New Dealers  the more socially conservative antiCommunist middleaged and middleincome whites who make up nearly a third of likely Democratic voters  returned to their party in the Congressional elections last year While 29 percent of these voters defected to vote for Ronald Reagan in 1984 92 percent voted Democratic for Congress in 1986 and the overwhelming majority of them stuck with their party in the Senate contest But according to the voter survey a sizeable number now show a readiness to defect again to the GOP in 1988 White Southern New Dealers are suspicious of their partys positions on social defense and foreign policy issues and uneasy with what they perceive as its willingness to kowtow to minorities While none of these issues is driving most of these voters now or will directly determine many votes the overall package presented by the party will Their voting habits  Democratic for Congress and Republican for President  are sufficiently ingrained that their Democratic Party cannot take their votes for granted If the party cannot appear at least mainstream on family and cultural values and sensible on defense and if it cannot avoid the perception that it is falling all over itself to accommodate Jesse Jackson and his issue positions it will lose a sizeable share of the minority of the white Southern vote it got in 1986  enough to lose precious and necessary electoral votes The 1986 Senate elections and the Bork setback not to speak of the stock markets collapse have created political euphoria among many Democrats who now see a road to electoral victory in the South in 1988 But that road is long and winding and filled with potholes for a party that has had a hard time finding experienced drivers

America Needs Taxpayers,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/28/opinion/have-a-baby-america-needs-taxpayers.html,Ronald Reagan has already pushed another trillion dollars of debt onto the next generation of taxpayers Now the Republican Presidential candidate Pat Robertson offers an even more refined idea of fiscal conservatism and family values America should breed more babies he says so therell be more people to pay taxes Mr Robertson a fundamentalist preacher and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network begins his argument on moral grounds by opposing abortion But he quickly enlarges it as he did in a speech and a TV interview last week into a practical argument We must have more children to expand the work force he said By the year 2020 we are not going to have enough money to take care of all the retirees there wont be enough money for government there wont be enough people to expand the markets and Americas share of world population will drop to insignificance That represents paradoxical politics disruptive social policy and callous morality As for politics Mr Robertson feels so strongly that despite his wellknown hostility to Big Government he wants Washington to promote fertility Parents he says should get a tax deduction of 3000 or 4000 every year for each child As for social policy the annual number of births has wavered around 35 million for years now bringing welcome stability to schools and other institutions badly buffeted by the 19461964 baby boom The stability is a special relief as Mr Robertson should know because of the potential for a reboom with so many women now in their childbearing years Worst of all Mr Robertsons proposition is tinhearted Why should people want to have a baby Because they want to nurture and to lavish love on a child to hand on wisdom or wealth to perpetuate a family line there are many wonderful reasons To produce more future taxpayers who can cover this generations Social Security costs is however not one of them America is built on the sweat and ambition of parents who by sacrificing for their children paid for the future Perversely Pat Robertson would have us breed babies so they can pay for the past

Bush Draws Foes' Fire in First Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/29/us/bush-draws-foes-fire-in-first-debate.html,The six Republican Presdential candidates faced off in their first debate here tonight and five of them aimed sharp attacks or subtle barbs at Vice President Bush who is far ahead of his adversaries in the public opinion polls Mr Bush offered his own acerbic observations about the ideas of some of his foes in an open effort to answer criticism that he lacks the toughness necessary in a President The debate underscored substantial divisions among the Republican candidates Among them only Mr Bush enthusiastically embraced the proposed treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate range missiles Clash Over Budget Deficit Four of the candidates  Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York former Gov Pete du Pont of Delaware Pat Robertson and former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr  vigorously attacked the treaty Senator Bob Dole the minority leader expressed skepticism about the agreement but stopped short of outright opposition Mr Dole and Mr Kemp also clashed about the budget deficit though all the Republicans cast themselves as opponents of tax increases The lively debate was the first time all the Republican candidates had confronted each other directly While the Democrats running for President have debated over and over the Reublicans had limited their joint apearances to serial speechmaking As the overwhelming leader in the Republican contest Mr Bush had the most to lose from the debate which was broadcast as a special edition of William F Buckley Jrs Firing Line program on PBS Mr Bushs foes had hoped that his tendency toward verbal gaffes would exhibit itself But aides to several of his adversaries acknowledged after the debate that Mr Bush not only avoided such mistakes but did well in several exchanges Loyalty or Sycophancy Mr Bush was forced by Mr Buckeys comoderator the former Democratic National Chairman Robert S Strauss to defend his record as Vice President Mr Strauss commended Mr Bushs loyalty to Mr Reagan but asked him to clarify his differences with the President now that he is a candidate in his own right Mr Bush declined saying he did not want to criticize the President Im not going to start doing now what I havent done for the last seven years Mr Bush said declaring that he was proud of support for the President Ive taken quite a few shots for conducting myself that way he said but insisted that his loyalty was a virtue not a flaw Mr Haig immediately jabbed at Mr Bush saying that his own definition of loyalty included offering the person to whom loyalty is given unwelcome advice and not what you think he wants to hear Mr Haig also made clear that he was not satisfied with the Reagan record Its very important for us to recognize that there have been mistakes made Mr Haig said We have some serious questions to answer to the American people Bucking the Establishment These he said included the size of the Federal deficit and relations with the Soviet Union including the continued presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan Mr Kemp said he had supported Mr Reagan in part because of his willingess to buck the establishment a dig at Mr Bushs background as a Yale graduate and Washington insider Mr Kemp also pointed out that he had supported Mr Reagan in 1980 another dig at Mr Bush who was Mr Reagans main opponent in the 1980 Republican primaries Mr Dole suggested that his support for Mr Reagan was more valuable to the President than Mr Bushs had been I supported the President on the Senate floor Mr Dole said I supported him with action The toughest exchange was provoked by a question about the treaty with the Soviet Union on intermediate range missiles Four of the Republicans opposed a treaty backed by Mr Reagan whom all claimed as a political hero Mr Haig said the treaty makes conventional war conceivable in Central Europe and represented arms control for arms controls sake Mistrust for Soviet Union Mr Kemp declared I wouldnt sign a new agreement with the Soviet Union until theyre required to keep the previous agreements Mr Robertson said he mistrusted the Soviet leaders I dont think they really want peace Mr Robertson said I think they want their own advantage He said the United States needs more signs of Soviet good intentions Let them tear down the Berlin Wall he said Mr du Pont added I dont support a treaty we cannot verify with a nation we cannot trust Mr Dole said the treaty should be viewed with a little dose of healthy skepticism I dont think we ought to be cheerleading for any treaties until we know whats in it he said Mr Bush chided all his opponents for criticizing the treaty which he said involved many more concessions from the Soviet Union than from the United States This is the first time in the nuclear age that we are getting rid of a whole class of nuclear weapons and thats good for my grandchildren and the rest of the world Mr Bush said I believe it will be verifiable I believe our country wants it A Nutty Idea Mr du Pont then engaged Mr Bush in a vigorous colloquy saying Mr Bush had been a follower of Mr Reagans policies but not a leader The question is in a Bush Presidency where will he lead America Mr du Pont asked So far we havent seen any vision any principles any policy The Republican audience booed Mr Bush responded by attacking Mr du Ponts proposal to make social security partly voluntary Pierre he said using Mr du Ponts formal name I think its a nutty idea to fool around with the social security system Its fine when youre outside criticizing carping at a President Mr Bush said I think its very different when youre in there having to make the tough calls Mr Haig in turn disputed Mr Bushs view that the Western European allies supported the treaty Europe is unnerved about this agreement and the arm twisting that was applied from Washington is unprecedented Mr Haig said The panic on Wall Street also produced a vigorous exchange Pineapple Juice and Scotch Mr Kemp argued that since stock prices on markets all over the world had dropped at the same time it could not be said that Americas budget deficit was the main cause of the Wall Street crash The collapse he said transcended the budget deficit and involved unstable exchange rates and high interest rates Mr Kemp vigorously expressed his opposition to new taxes as did Mr du Pont Mr Dole chided Mr Kemp saying that the Congressman had been wrong in thinking that the United States would grow out of its deficit by cutting taxes and promoting economic expansion The Republicans were considerably more given to humor in their exchanges than the Democrats had been when they debated on Mr Buckleys program Many of their jabs were tempered with a chuckle or a joke Mr Haig asked to criticize Mr Dole characterized the Senator as watered down pineapple juice and urged voters to remember that Haig  Haig is the real McCoy Mr Robertson said that George Bush had been the greatest Vice President in the nations history and that he would be pleased if he would continue in that role in a Robertson Administration He had tendered a similiar offer to Mr Dole earlier in the debate Mr Dole who has been accused of being acerbic to the point of nastiness rarely criticized his foes When he did so his tone was oblique and jocular I came here tonight to be nice and polite he said at one point explaining why he was not mixing it up more with his adversaries Going into the debate Mr Bush held a substantial lead in the contest The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll released Tuesday showed Mr Bush with 43 percent among likely Republican primary voters as against 22 percent for Mr Dole 7 percent for Mr Robertson 6 percent for Mr Kemp 3 percent for Mr Haig and 1 percent for Mr du Pont Morever when Republicans were asked their second choices Mr Bush and Mr Dole were again far ahead Common Goal for Candidates Thus the debate was especially critical for the four candidates who trail in the race since it was their first opportunity to appear as equals to Mr Bush and Mr Dole before an audience estimated at 10 million people The four shared a common goal tonight to say something sufficiently sharp and controversial that they would draw the attention of journalists and party leaders Mr du Pont was the most willing to risk open conflict Mr Kemp Mr Haig and Mr Robertson also chose opportunities to swing freely In their closing statements all of the candidates went back to their central themes Mr du Pont who used the forum to show off some of his controversial proposals  abolishing farm subsidies and requiring all welfare recipients to work  cast himself as the candidate of ideas We Are Facing Tough Problems Clear principles sound policy and common sense  thats what the Presidency of the United States is about he said Mr Dole said the country needed a strong President who will understand when an emergency arises and will deal with it He also said that the Republican Party needed to convey that it had a sense of compassion for the needy Mr Haig sought to turn his reputation for toughness viewed by some as a liability into an asset We are facing tough problems he said and we need a tough leader Mr Kemp offered his standard message of uplift He said the nation faced stark choices but that there were no limits to the future of this country and no problems we cant solve by working together He urged deployment of an antimissile in space and criticized Mr Dole and Mr Bush for their skepticism about immediate implementation of such a system Mr Robertson stressed moral themes ranging from fidelity in marriage to the evils of abortion I believe in reaching out to every single American so that truly this nation might be one nation under God he said As for Mr Bush he stressed his strong suit experience You need somebody in the hot seat with a cool hand on the stick he said Ive been copilot for seven years and I know how to land that plane in a storm

PRESIDENT SELECTS APPELLATE JUDGE TO BECOME JUSTICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/us/president-selects-appellate-judge-to-become-justice.html,President Reagan today nominated Douglas H Ginsburg a conservative judge who has been on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since last November to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court The nomination of Judge Ginsburg came after several Democratic senators citing his relative lack of judicial experience and a strong conservative outlook advised the White House that he was the most controversial person on the Presidents final list of candidates As Mr Reagan presented Judge Ginsburg at a 15minute ceremony in the East Room of the White House this afternoon he criticized the Senate for its handling of his previous nominee Judge Robert H Bork That nomination was defeated last week 58 to 42 after a long and bitter fight Mr Reagan called the battle a disservice to the Court and to the nation and said the American people will know whats up if the Senate does not act on the new nomination quickly Prepared for Another Fight Mr Reagans statements signaled that he was prepared for the possibility of another tough confirmation battle Many Republican senators expressed support for Judge Ginsburg However some Democrats advised the White House in private discussions earlier this week that the other principal finalist Judge Anthony M Kennedy of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California would likely be confirmed without significant difficulty but that Judge Ginsburg might run into trouble The White House said Mr Reagan did not make up his mind on his nominee until this morning Judge Ginsburg was said to have been the favored candidate of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and others in the Justice Department Many in the White House including the chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr were reported to have preferred Judge Kennedy partly because it seemed likely that he could win confirmation more easily President Reagan described Judge Ginsburg as a believer in judicial restraint and said he would be strong on lawandorder issues although there is little in the judges record to show how he stands on criminal law questions Judge Ginsburg is 41 years old and has served on the appeals court less than a year Previously he was an official in the Justice Department and at the Office of Management and Budget and he has also taught at Harvard Law School His views on constitutional issues like abortion wider privacy rights and the rights of minorities are little known since his writings have focused on technical regulatory and antitrust issues White House officials had said they wanted a nominee who had written far less than Judge Bork giving opponents less material they could use against him Some in the White House had also said they wanted as much as anything else a nominee who could be confirmed easily to avoid another bitter battle that could jeopardize the Presidents other legislative proposals But Administration officials said conservatives in and out of government had lobbied heavily for Judge Ginsburg Judge Ginsburg would be the youngest Court appointee in almost 50 years and the prospect that he could serve for several decades if confirmed caused some senators to say they would examine him especially closely Some Senate Democrats said privately that they worried about his qualifications noting that he received only a qualified rating from the American Bar Association when he was nominated to the appeals court last year That is the bar associations lowest of three affirmative ratings and was apparently given because of Mr Ginsburgs inexperience as a trial lawyer The association will now rate him in the context of his Supreme Court nomination in which its standards are tougher In welcoming the nomination Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader said Judge Ginsburg was well qualified Mr Dole added that his discussions with other senators suggested that maybe it will not be so difficult to win confirmation Senator Dole said that when the White House offered Judge Ginsburgs name among others to Senate leaders earlier this week its my understanding that no one in effect said we couldnt accept the nominee Senator Alan K Simpson a Wyoming Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee said Judge Ginsburg is going to be an outstanding Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Some Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans said they were not yet ready to make a judgment about Judge Ginsburg because they did not know enough about him I dont know him said Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican who was an important Bork opponent I really have no knowledge of his record and I dont know him personally But Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California called Judge Ginsburg a surprising choice because of his youth and relative inexperience on the bench Senator Cranston said From what I hear there might well be a major controversy over Ginsburg Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts a Judicary Committee member called Judge Ginsburg an ideological clone of Judge Bork  a Judge Bork without a paper trail Administration officials pointed out however that in the confirmation hearing on Mr Ginsburgs nomination to the appeals court last year Senator Kennedy praised him as an excellent and openminded nominee with a sense of compassion and with understanding of the law Little Comment From Biden Senator Joseph R Biden Jr the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee said little today but promised to work to complete our review of the nomination as quickly as possible Several lobbying organizations meanwhile reacted immediately to the nomination People for the American Way a central player in the fight against Judge Bork called the new choice a disappointment and added that Judge Ginsburg is a virtual blank page whose chief qualification appears to be his adherence to a narrow ideological agenda Nan Aron executive director of the Alliance for Justice another important opponent of the Bork nomination said We are going to be looking at this nomination with extreme skepticism and will exhaustively review his record and judge him by the same high standards set by the Senate in the Bork nomination Concerned Women for America a conservative group that campaigned for Judge Bork commended the choice and urged the Senate to confirm Judge Ginsburg quickly And the National Right to Life Committee the largest antiabortion group said it would fight for Judge Ginsburgs confirmation At the White House the President complained bitterly about the long delay in voting on Judge Borks nomination It was pending for 16 weeks and Mr Reagan asserted that one senator boasted that the reason was to allow time to gear up the political campaign against him The President did not identify the senator Referring to Mr Reagans remarks Senator Robert C Byrd the majority leader said I urge us all to take care that we dont fan old flames I want to caution those at the other end of the avenue who contributed greatly to the polarization in the Bork nomination I urge you to be cautious that you dont contribute in the same manner to this nomination Judge Ginsburg tall slender and bearded was dressed in a threepiece blue suit with a gold watch chain draped across the vest He spoke only briefly at the White House ceremony In a confident baritone voice he thanked Mr Reagan and said Im looking forward to the confirmation process and upon confirmation to taking a place on the Court and playing a part in the work that it does that is so important in our system of government Judges Ginsburg and Kennedy had been accompanied as finalists on thge Presidents list by another Federal appeals court judge William W Wilkins Jr of the Fouth Circuit in South Carolina But although Judge Wilkins was on the short list in the final hours the debate really involved a choice between Judge Kennedy and Judge Ginsburg officials said Both men are conservative but Judge Kennedys views on some issues are believed to be more moderate In essence then the final decision was between a nominee whose views most closely matched Mr Reagans and one likely to be confirmed without a fight from the Presidents Democratic opposition At the same time officials said at least one Senate conservative Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina had threatened to stage a filibuster against Judge Kennedy
MAN IN THE NEWS; YOUTHFUL CONSERVATIVE JUDGE: DOUGLAS HOWARD GINSBURG,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/us/man-in-the-news-youthful-conservative-judge-douglas-howard-ginsburg.html,Judge Douglas H Ginsburg one of the youngest men ever nominated to the Supreme Court is known here chiefly as a strong brainy advocate of the Reagan Administrations conservative freemarket approach to regulatory and antitrust law issues What is not known about the 41yearold judge  at least to those outside the Administration  are his views on many of the great constitutional issues civil rights and civil liberties privacy and the role of the courts in protecting them It was these issues that fueled the contentious debate over Judge Robert H Borks nomination which the Senate rejected last week by a vote of 58 to 42 Judge Ginsburg is highly praised by friends and former colleagues as an extremely intelligent openminded personable and decent man with a wry sense of humor and varied interests a voracious reader who left college temporarily and helped run a nationwide computer dating service On the other hand a few former colleagues on the Harvard Law School faculty said that he had been considered a dry dull classroom teacher and that he was delayed a year in obtaining tenure because of concerns about whether he had done enough important scholarly writing He eventually won tenure and several former faculty colleagues praised his intellectual capacity Probable Questions Senate confirmation proceedings are likely to center on controversy over the regulatory and antitrust policies that Judge Ginsburg helped carry out as an Administration official from 1983 to 1986 probing questions about his views on constitutional issues and concerns about whether he is too young and inexperienced for the Supreme Court Judge Ginsburg would be the youngest person to join the Supreme Court since Justice William O Douglas who was 40 when he joined the Court in 1939 The last previous appointment of a someone that young was in 1853 Some Administration conservatives who have worked with Judge Ginsburg have privately expressed confidence that he shares their originalist approach to constitutional issues including their view that the Supreme Court was wrong to recognize a constitutional right to have an abortion But Judge Ginsburgs writings focusing on important but highly technical regulatory and antitrust issues have said very little about constitutional law very little about criminal law issues outside the area of whitecollar crime and nothing apparently about abortion Former colleagues on the Harvard Law School faculty and others said that the choice of Judge Ginsburg might indicate that Administration conservatives with whom he has served who pushed for his nomination despite the prospect of confirmation problems knew more about his views than could be gleaned from the public record Rating by Bar Committee When the President chose him for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit late last year the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary rated Judge Ginsburg only minimally qualified for the position apparently because of concerns about his limited experience Before joining the appeals court last November Judge Ginsburg had worked in three Administration positions and had taught at Harvard Law School but had not been involved in private law practice He joined the Justice Department as one of the top officials in the Antitrust Division in 1983 then moved to the Office of Management and Budget where he headed a program to make regulations more costeffective and consistent with Administration policy Some key members of Congress strongly criticized him and the Administration for what they called ignoring the intent of Congress in regulatory statutes He returned to the Justice Department as head of the Antitrust Division in 1985 He was known there for supporting Administration efforts to ease antitrust restraints on big business mergers and some other practices while at the same time pressing aggressively for tough criminal penalties against those engaged in blatant pricefixing and other white collar crimes Early Years in College Born on May 25 1946 in Chicago and educated at Cornell University and later like Judge Bork at the University of Chicago Law School Douglas Howard Ginsburg was law clerk to Judge Carl McGowan of the District of Columbia Circuit and then to Justice Thurgood Marshall the Supreme Courts only black member who told a reporter today he would have no comment on the nomination Justice Marshall said that since last summer he had adopted a general policy of not commenting on nominations Judge Ginsburg was assistant professor and then professor at Harvard Law School from 1975 to 1983 specializing in antitrust and economic regulation Judge Ginsburg who is Jewish lives in Washington with his wife Dr Hallee Morgan an obstetrician who is said to have suspended her practice to spend time at home with their 2yearold daughter Hallee K Morgan He also has a 17yearold daughter by a previous marriage named Jessica DeSecundy her mothers surname Judge Ginsburg like Judge Bork is described by friends and critics alike as a passionate advocate of the Chicago School approach to legal and economic issues including great skepticism about many forms of governmental regulation faith in free markets and use of economic analysis to resolve many  but not all legal issues Reactions Are Varied Prof Laurence H Tribe of the Harvard Law School who was a faculty colleague of Judge Ginsburg and was one of the most prominent witnesses to testify against Judge Borks nomination said I like and respect Doug and I think hes very very bright but I know little or nothing about his constitutional philosophy and his philosophy about the role of the courts on the very issues that became crucial in the hearings on the Bork nomination The function of the hearings will be informing the Senate about a nominee whose views are not known Mr Tribe added The public posture Administration officials are taking is that they know his philosophy to be similar to Judge Borks Where they get that is interesting and needs to be explored Another Harvard Law professor who is well to the left of center politically and requested anonymity said Judge Ginsburg could be much much more right wing than Bork But several other professors scoffed at this view On the social agenda I think hes no Bork said Prof Richard Stewart Prof Hal Scott of Harvard Law Scool who went to the Latin School in Chicago and law school with Judge Ginsburg and called him his best friend expressed delight at his nomination He also said the nominee has matured beyond his years Hes a terrific person he said Hes a person who is openminded hes flexible he gets to the bottom of things I think he will have the quality of judicial restraint in the sense that he will think hard before he declares a statute unconstitutional Christopher DeMuth president of the American Enterprise Institute and an old friend and colleague of the nominee said they are members of a club that reads a book each month and then meets to discuss it This months book is Beryl Markhams West With the Night Last months was Victor Hugos Les Miserables Asked why Judge Ginsburgs younger daughter Hallee K Morgan had her mothers surname rather than her fathers Mr DeMuth said I guess they liked the name it is modern marriage taken to the ultimate Bob Bedell an OMB official who was Mr Ginsburgs deputy there and knows him well said today that he was a baseball buff an inveterate reader with wideranging interests and a swimmer who does daily laps in a backyard pool weather permitting He said that Judge Ginsburgs wife was a superb cook and that the two often work on special dishes together when having friends to dinner You never turn down an invitation because it means good company and good cuisine he said
The Republicans and the Real World,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/opinion/the-republicans-and-the-real-world.html,The last week or two has brought wave on wave of urgent news but you wouldnt know it from the first Republican Presidential debate The Persian Gulf crisis It elicited not a word from the six candidates The prospective ReaganGorbachev summit meeting Barely mentioned Only Vice President Bush gave responsible support to the sound prospective treaty on Euromissiles The world stock market turmoil Only Senator Bob Dole gave a sensible live response the others mostly parroted canned positions about how dependably they oppose new taxes The Wednesday night debate may have given partisans the basis for choosing one candidate or another as the Republican nominee But the event oddly distant from reality gave the general public little basis for choosing one or another as President When William F Buckley conducted a parallel Democratic debate in Houston in July the candidates were decorous to each other This time there were frequent transgressions against the Republicans Eleventh Commandment Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican The sins were inevitable While there is no obvious frontrunner among the Democrats Vice President George Bush runs far ahead of his rivals in the polls and is their common target Thus they seemed eager to bait needle and even slash Pete du Pont assailed Mr Bush so sharply for his supposed lack of vision that the audience booed Jack Kemp recalled that he himself had campaigned for Ronald Reagan in 1980 leaving loudly unsaid that Mr Bush and Senator Dole briefly had run against Mr Reagan Alexander Haig strained to inject the word wimp into an exchange with the Vice President The sniping may have backfired Mr Bushs unhesitating responses helped him demonstrate fiber and fervor Both he and Senator Dole showed that they have learned about primaries from the Democrats Over the last 15 years Democratic candidates repeatedly have followed a highly partisan path to the nomination but have thus antagonized moderate voters This was a Republican debate in a hall filled with Republicans but the world was watching As the other four longershot candidates pressed highly partisan positions Mr Bush and Senator Dole pressed moderation Both joined in the dogmatic opposition to abortion  but both did so in the context of family planning or broader social concern When Pat Robertson denounced a bloated Federal bureaucracy Mr Bush went out of his way to praise devoted civil servants Senator Dole fighting a reputation for harsh partisanship was the only consistent voice for women minorities and the poor and seemed at times to hold his tongue perhaps to the point of overcorrected blandness Overcorrected the word applies to the whole event more rehearsed performance than spontaneous debate The candidates seemed determined to ignore imperative liveaction events and instead to concentrate on presenting prepackaged personas and positions While storms rage in world stock markets for instance Mr Bush says he wont raise taxes if elected and Mr Robertson and Mr du Pont ring the alarm about Social Security problems in the next century The Republican candidates say they want to give the country leadership what they gave on Wednesday was mostly potted plants
ISRAEL: SINGLE FATHERS' PROTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/31/style/israel-single-fathers-protest.html,In what could be a groundbreaking case the unmarried father of a baby girl has sued the mother of his child for 40000 shekels about 25000 in personal damages because he contends she had the child against his will The father is a member of a newly formed group of Israeli men called Fathers by Force The groups members plan to take legal measures to recoup the financial and emotional damages they say they incurred when the women with whom they were involved decided unilaterally to have a child The claims raise serious and complex questions about sexual mores and responsibilities In many cases the men say the women have lied and have said they were using contraceptives when in fact they were planning to have a child all along Then after bearing the child they have successfully sued the father for paternity and childsupport payments A woman today knows it is very easy to determine paternity said Shmuel Baniel a lawyer who specializes in family law and heads the association although he himself is not a father against his will So if she wants a child and its too late for her to marry or she doesnt want to marry for some reason she has only to decide on a candidate and she can plan the pregnancy Israeli courts accept tissuetyping tests as a basis for establishing paternity and are rigorous in setting paternal childsupport payments and insuring that such payments are made Although a man may refuse to submit to a tissuetyping test the court may interpret his refusal as admission of paternity 5000 Single Mothers There are an estimated 5000 single mothers in Israel and the number of children born to nevermarried women has increased in recent years from 650 in 1978 to 818 in 1984 according to Israels Central Bureau of Statistics Womens groups acknowledge that some women do indeed deceive men in paternity matters but they point out that childsupport payments are awarded to the child and that the child cannot be held responsible for his mothers behavior If the man feels harm has been done to him and he has the evidence and can prove it in court let him bring a damage suit against the mother said Ofra Friedman a lawyer who works for Naamat the womens arm of the national Histadruth Labor Federation But the child must be protected The child must not be punished because of his parents relationship Fathers by Force does not confine its activity to cases of deceit Even in the case of an accidental pregnancy its members say that a woman who refuses to terminate the pregnancy or put the child up for adoption must be prepared to accept the consequences Tirza Geva a director of the Organization of Unwed Mothers in Israel disagreed An abortion is not so simple she said and a woman has nine months to become attached to her baby during the pregnancy This is something a man may not be able to understand because he doesnt go through it For her part Ms Friedman said this about Fathers by Force Its too bad this groups message isnt Men take the burden of birth control on yourselves 
"IDEAS & TRENDS;
GETTING PERMISSION TO HAVE AN ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/weekinreview/ideas-trends-getting-permission-to-have-an-abortion.html,LEAD IN the 15 years since the Supreme Court ruled that women have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion much of the national debate on the subject has focused on an issue of particular emotional import abortions performed on minors IN the 15 years since the Supreme Court ruled that women have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion much of the national debate on the subject has focused on an issue of particular emotional import abortions performed on minors In recent weeks California has become the 23d state to pass legislation requiring some notification or consent of parents or a judge before a minor can obtain an abortion About 35000 California teenagers a year undergo abortions and the American Civil Liberties Union estimates that about half of them do not consult their parents  a situation that will change on Jan 1 if the new law takes effect as scheduled The future of such laws is in some doubt however On Tuesday the Supreme Court is to hear arguments on the law in Illinois in which it will consider a constitutional challenge to the requirement that a minor notify both parents 24 hours in advance of an abortion and to the adequacy of the judicial consent procedure Six states that have similar requirements have been enjoined from enforcing them pending the Supreme Courts ruling in the Illinois case and several other state laws are not being enforced while they are in litigation The California statute enacted five weeks ago requires that anyone under the age of 18 either obtain the written consent of one parent or guardian before an abortion can be performed or petition the juvenile court for a hearing at which she must convince a judge that she is sufficiently mature and informed to make the decision on her own The process is not required in a medical emergency arising from the pregnancy that requires immediate attention Of the 23 states that restrict access to abortion for minors  which in almost all states is anyone under 18 years of age  13 require the consent of one or both parents as California does The other 10 like Illinois require only notification of parents New York New Jersey and Connecticut do not require eitherMaybe Lean on Her  Antiabortion activists who supported the new California law concede that their goal is the elimination of abortion When asked how the issue could be resolved within the family if a minor wished to have an abortion and her parents opposed it W B Timberlake president of the Committee on Moral Concerns in Sacramento said The parents would probably do their best to try to talk her out of it and maybe lean on her a little bit Margaret Crosby a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California said that group would file suit this month to block the law The statute is vulnerable both under the states constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to privacy and under several Federal court decisions holding that the judicial consent procedure must be confidential and speedy Ms Crosby said Much of the case law has centered on whether both parents must know about their daughters decision to have an abortion and on the adequacy of the court procedures Those favoring the laws argue that the state has a compelling interest in promoting stronger family bonds by insuring that the parents greater maturity and experience as well as their support will be available to their daughter in making an important decision The Court has recognized that parental consent is a valid state interest said James Bopp Jr general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee a national organization opposing abortion The protection parental involvement gives to minors is most felt when there is a crisis and the need of maturity and experience is the greatest he said But opponents argue that this rosy portrait of family life simply does not exist for many teenagers and that a daughters pregnancy often causes further deterioration of an already poor situation These laws dont promote family integrity said Rachael N Pine staff counsel for the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union In good families teens go to their parents Requiring it doesnt help family dynamicsRuling in Minnesota  Another major court challenge under way in Minnesota will test the arguments of abortionrights advocates that the requirements of these statutes are unrealistic unwieldy and intimidating In August a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit struck down Minnesotas law which required that girls under 18 notify both parents or obtain judicial approval before getting an abortion The court found that such requirements may do more to fractionize the family integrity than preserve it and may be adverse to the best interests of the pregnant minor The state has petitioned for a rehearing before the full court According to Ms Pine the case was the first to present evidence of the actual operation of the law One consequence the court found was that teenagers fearful of confronting their parents often delayed until it was too far along in the pregnancy to obtain an abortion In Minneapolis the evidence showed a 386 percent jump in the birth rate among 15 and 16yearolds after the law took effect in 1981 Ms Pine said The impact was greatest in poor families The judicial consent option also did not function well the court said and frequently required that minors travel long distances two or three times to obtain the approval of a judge And for those teenagers who did make it through the court procedure judges invariably waived the requirement of parental notification denying fewer than a dozen requests between 1981 and 1986  and thus rendering the entire process largely needless
COURT CHOICE IN FOCUS: A PORTRAIT OF GINSBURG,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/us/court-choice-in-focus-a-portrait-of-ginsburg.html,Douglas H Ginsburg President Reagans new choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is best known in Washington as an advocate of a conservative philosophy of government regulation prodding agencies to decide regulatory questions according to a strict comparison of the social costs and benefits Senate aides say his confirmation hearings are likely to focus on the 14 months from July 1984 to September 1985 when he was the White House official in charge of reviewing and issuing Federal regulations One reason for this is that in his relatively short period as a Federal judge Mr Ginsburg has not compiled a record of public opinions on a broad range of issues like civil rights privacy abortion and other constitutional questions However an examination of his writings and interviews with friends and associates reveal some details of his judicial style and philosophy While these matters will also occupy the Senate panel examining his qualifications it is his actions in the White House that will provide a basis for much of the questioning Criticized on Rules A Federal judge and two Congressional committees criticized his performance in the White House saying that Mr Ginsburgs office had improperly interfered with efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to issue rules on asbestos and the storage of hazardous wastes in underground tanks They said his office had insinuated itself into the decisionmaking process of the environmental agency emphasizing costbenefit analysis in a way not intended by Congress In this Administration Mr Ginsburg has also served as an Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department espousing firmly conservative positions on technical questions of antitrust law government regulation and economics Short Paper Trail Mr Ginsburg 41 years old has been a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit described by the White House as the most prestigious and important of the Federal appeals courts for less than a year In a questionnaire that he filled out after he was nominated for that seat last fall Mr Ginsburg said I have avoided narrow specialization in a single field of law But he has apparently left little record of writings or opinions on civil rights abortion or other contentious social issues and his personal views on such matters are unknown even to some of his close friends Law Review Defense In an article last year in the Harvard Law Review he defended his work as an Administration official He acknowledged that it had provoked controversy because he explicitly asserted Presidential control over agency rulemaking and sought to give the President and his political appointees greater influence in the process But last year a Federal district judge ruled that such efforts had gone too far The judge said that a branch of the Office of Management and Budget then headed by Mr Ginsburg had improperly delayed environmental regulations beyond statutory deadlines set by Congress OMB interference with EPA after statutory or judicial deadlines had passed was in contravention of Federal law and raises some constitutional concerns Judge Thomas A Flannery said He ordered the Government to pay 49738 in lawyers fees and expenses to the environmental group that filed the lawsuit The Government did not appeal There is no clear ideological split on the Supreme Court with respect to cases involving antitrust law and Government regulation of business and commerce However Judge Ginsburg could make a difference on the outcome of such cases Many of the cases are technical and other justices might tend to defer to him to some extent because of his expertise lawyers said The views of Judge Ginsburg like those of other freemarket theorists are at odds with Supreme Court precedents on some antitrust issues But recent Supreme Court decisions like the consensus of the antitrust bar have been moving somewhat in their direction toward greater tolerance of some bigbusiness practices that were once considered anticompetitive What follows is an intellectual portrait of Mr Ginsburg as it emerges from his writings and from interviews with more than 25 of his friends and acquaintances Another Bork Yes    and No Prof Richard A Epstein who had Mr Ginsburg as a student at the University of Chicago Law School in 1973 said he was an excellent technical lawyer But Professor Epstein said on issues other than antitrust and regulation I could not tell you what his views are Judge Ginsburg serves on the appeals court here with Judge Robert H Bork whose nomination to the Supreme Court was decisively rejected by the Senate on Oct 23 They share many marketoriented views on law and economics but they appear to differ in key respects Geoffrey P Miller a law professor at the University of Chicago and a friend of Mr Ginsburgs said I think hes going to surprise a lot of people He is not by any means a clone of Judge Bork The two are very similar in their attitude to economic regulation of business But they are very different in their outlook on judging and on the legal system as a whole Bork is a pluralist he believes that the best outcome is that which comes out of the political process Mr Miller continued Ginsburg is a libertarian I believe someone who believes that the government should stay off the backs of people in all areas of life  the privacy of the bedroom rights of speech even offensive speech rights of the press In 1973 Mr Ginsburg wrote a short article for the University of Chicago Law Review suggesting that there should be fairly broad First Amendment protection of political dissent in peacetime and war He has also argued that cable television operators are entitled to certain rights of free speech under the First Amendment Mr Epstein said Bork loves to shoot from the hip Ginsburg is a man of ultimately measured judgement He does not commit himself in advance on anything Philip B Kurland a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago said Mr Ginsburg a former student appeared to be uncommitted on many of the big issues that confront the High Court Comparing the two men Mr Kurland said The difference lies in the fact that Judge Bork has been outspoken in his commitment to extensive constituional revision with a judicial philosophy of restrained approval of civil rights and liberties But there is no basis for saying that Mr Ginsburg has a judicial philosophy Mr Kurland said adding Hes likely to do what good judges do which is to rely on precedent statutes and constitutional provisions and to take it case by case The Primacy Of Markets Mr Ginsburg is imbued with many of the conservative ideas associated with the Chicago school of law and economics This outlook derived from libertarian principles opposes many forms of Government regulation favors reliance on market forces to allocate resources and stresses economic efficiency as an overriding objective Mr Ginsburg emphasized these ideas when he led Administration efforts to shape a policy opposing Federal restrictions on corporate takeovers which he said were good for the economy and for shareholders A wave of such takeovers prompted several members of Congress to propose legislative restrictions in 1985 Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin argued that the takeovers threaten the very foundations of our business system wreak havoc in many communities and serve little purpose but to make millions for professional raiders and investment bankers But Mr Ginsburg who led a subcommittee of the White House Economic Policy Council studying the issue said that Federal attempts to control corporate takeovers would be ineffective at best and harmful at worst Such takeovers he said often serve a valuable purpose disciplining inefficient manpurpose disciplining inefficient management and enabling stockholders to In 1985 he severely criticized a proposal by the Federal Reserve Board to limit the use of lowgrade bonds in corporate takeovers He said that state laws the nations courts and market forces were generally sufficient to curb any abuses by people attempting hostile takeovers or by the target companies Michael J Horowitz who was counsel to the director of the Office of Management and Budget while Mr Ginsburg was in charge of regulatory affairs said his handling of the proposals to restrict corporate takeovers showed his ability to avoid political land mines and booby traps by focusing on the merits rather than the politics of an issue Mr Horowitz said that many other conservatives approached the law in moralistic terms but that Doug uses a more disciplined more analytic approach Putting Theory To the Test However the law sometimes does not allow as much leeway for the analysis of costs and benefits as Mr Ginsburg wanted when he was chief of regulatory policy at the Office of Management and Budget in 198485 Mr Ginsburgs activities were chronicled in a 1985 report by the investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee dominated by Democrats and in a 1986 staff report issued by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works then led by Republicans The House report said OMBs secret and heavyhanded interference with two draft proposed rules designed to protect the public against the cancer risks of asbestos was an unlawful abuse of power In 1983 and 1984 according to the two committees the Environmental Protection Agency drafted proposals to ban four specific categories of asbestos products and to impose a steadily declining limit on the amount of asbestos produced in the United States But the committees said under pressure from Mr Ginsburgs office environmental officials suddenly withdrew the proposals in February 1985 and referred the question of asbestos regulation to two other Federal agencies W Stephen Cannon a spokesman for Mr Ginsburg said Friday that Mr Ginsburg would have no comment on the case In 1985 Mr Ginsburg and his staff argued that the cost of the asbestos proposals exceeded the benefits and that the referrals were required by the Federal law on toxic substances However environmental officials said at the time that Mr Ginsburgs office had understated the benefits of the proposed rules by discounting the value of human life The budget office suggested assigning an arbitrary value of 1 million to each life saved by preventing cancer through the control of asbestos But under guidelines suggested by the budget office a life would be deemed to be worth only a fraction of that amount about 22000 if the cancer remained latent and caused death in 40 years The House report described such a calculus as morally repugnant Cases in Point Trusts on Trial Mr Ginsburg was on the faculty of Harvard Law School from 1975 to 1983 and for the last six years of that period he also engaged in the parttime practice of law His practice like his academic and Government work focused on the intersection of business and the law he advised companies in regulated industries how to take advantage of new business opportunities My clients were major financial institutions such as Chase Manhattan Corporation and the State Street Boston Corporation as well as telephone operating companies owned by GTE Corporation he told the Senate Judiciary Committee when it was considering his nomination to be an appellate judge last year Mr Ginsburg worked twice in the antitrust division of the Justice Department from July 1983 to July 1984 as deputy assistant attorney general and then from September 1985 to October 1986 as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the division When asked about his courtroom experience Mr Ginsburg replied in his questionnaire in terms of the litigation that he supervised in the antitrust division He said he had appeared in court frequently through the indictments informations and briefs that I have caused or authorized to be filed on behalf of the Government He said verdicts or judgments were issued in 34 cases in his tenure Mr Ginsburg supervised the prosecution of many pricefixing cases As head of antitrust division he sought criminal penalties against pricefixers bidriggers and other whitecollar criminals and he criticized judges who would not sentence them to prison In one case he challenged the merger of two major hospital supply companies and helped negotiate a consent judgment under which they agreed to divest themselves of certain assets so there would be no harm to competition as a result of the merger But in other cases Mr Ginsburg as a Justice Department official carried out Administration policies opposing antitrust restraints on big business mergers For example he urged the Supreme Court not to block the merger of two large beefpackers A competitor had challenged the merger on the ground that the newly formed company would slash its prices below its costs in an effort to increase its market share Mr Ginsburg argued that customers might actually benefit from such supercompetitive pricing The Supreme Court 6 to 2 refused to block the merger but also declined to accept Mr Ginsburgs argument that fears of predatory pricing should never be a sufficient basis for a company to challenge the merger of two rivals The Student In the Suit Mr Ginsburgs colleagues say he sometimes displays a dry sense of humor and wry detachment from the issues swirling around him His undergraduate years at Cornell University 196465 and 196870 were interrupted when he undertook a business venture a nationwide computer dating service known as Operation Match For a fee the company arranged blind dates through the use of data collected from questionnaires Jeffrey Tarr now a risk arbitrager in New York City was a cofounder of Operation Match and shared housing with Mr Ginsburg in Cambridge Mass and in Manhattan Doug had dropped out of Cornell he was in the process of finding himself he was confused looking for his identity Mr Tarr recalled in an interview He didnt have a place to live he was staying at different dorms hanging around Cambridge looking for something to do We hired him he was bright Douglas Ginsburg was born in Chicago the last of three children of Katherine Goodmont Ginsburg and her husband Maurice who ran a mortgage finance business The oldest child Robert continued the family business Their sister is now Sandra Stein an administrator at Cornell University After graduating from Cornell Douglas Ginsburg went to the University of Chicago Law School His classmates there remember him as unusually sober and serious One of them John F Cooney now a Washington lawyer said Mr Ginsburg displayed massive powers of concentration studiously reading casebooks amid the chaos of people going back and forth in the reading room of the law school library Another classmate Frank H Easterbrook recalled Mr Ginsburg as somebody who seemed to be 40 years old when he enrolled in law school at the age of 24 You could tell at a glance that Doug had been in the business world said Mr Easterbrook now a judge on the United States Court of Apepals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago While everyone else was dressed in a scruffy way in sewer boots Doug was dressed in a threepiece suit Close to Law Far From Politics Mr Ginsburg was confirmed unanimously by the Senate last year for the seat vacated by Judge J Skelly Wright a liberal who assumed senior status after serving 24 years on the appeals court here At his confirmation hearing for the appeals court position Mr Ginsburg was warmly praised by Senators Edward M Kennedy and John F Kerry Democrats of Massachusetts Last week Mr Kennedy expressed concern about confirming Mr Ginsburg for the Supreme Court saying he feared the judge would be an ideological clone of Judge Bork Most cases before the appeals court are heard by threejudge panels Judge Ginsburg and Judge Bork have rarely been on the same panels But they were on the same side in a remarkable dispute that exposed the political polarization of the court last July The courts conservative faction composed of Judge Ginsburg Judge Bork and the four other Reagan appointees voted initially to review a series of cases decided by threejudge panels with liberal majorities But when one Reagan appointee switched sides the court reversed itself and decided 6 to 5 not to rehear the cases The liberals said that the conservatives used selfserving and resultoriented criteria in deciding whether to review the decisions in those cases Mr Ginsburgs judicial opinions do not provide much insight into his political orientation They are closely reasoned competently written and carefully premised on Supreme Court precedents with few of the rhetorical flourishes or philosophical digressions found in the opinions of Judge Bork In many of his decisions Judge Ginsburg is joined by judges appointed by Democratic Presidents In separate cases Judge Ginsburg rejected challenges to special prosecutors investigating Michael K Deaver a former deputy chief of staff to President Reagan and Lieut Col Oliver L North who was dismissed from his job on the staff of the National Security Council In the North case Judge Ginsburg said it was unnecessary for him to decide the constitutionality of the special prosecutor law under which the prosecutor Lawrence E Walsh was appointed last December Judge Ginsburg said Mr Walsh had all the legal powers he needed as a result of his parallel appointment to a similar position by the Attorney General in March of this year In the Deaver case Judge Ginsburg joined his colleagues on the appeals court in refusing to interfere with the criminal proceedings They said Mr Deaver could challenge the law later in appeals if he were convicted In another case involving a coal companys challenge to its citation by the Government for minesafety violations Judge Ginsburg seemed to favor more judicial restraint than some of his colleagues on the court The case was not fit for review he said because the coal company had suffered no hardship and because it could appeal to the court again if it suffered hardship in the future

SUFFOLK LEGISLATURE FACING EXTENSIVE CHANGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/nyregion/suffolk-legislature-facing-extensive-changes.html,LEAD THE Suffolk County Legislature the bedrock of Long Island opposition to the Shoreham nuclear power plant is about to be transformed by Tuesdays election THE Suffolk County Legislature the bedrock of Long Island opposition to the Shoreham nuclear power plant is about to be transformed by Tuesdays election With four incumbents not running and several legislators caught in tight races changes in the holders of the 18 legislative seats are assured Nearly as certain is a shift in the delicate political balance of eight Democratic legislators eight Republicans and two Conservatives Both major parties are fighting for a clear majority And the Legislatures Presiding Officer Gregory J Blass Republican of Jamesport said it would be difficult for him to win a third oneyear term in the post when the newly elected legislators vote among themselves in January if either Republicans or Democrats hold the majority Mr Blass has depended on bipartisan support to win the influential county post which carries powers of appointment and agenda setting But one thing that wont change as a result of the election according to the candidates and other watchers of the races is the Legislatures position on the Shoreham plant Of all 36 Democratic and Republican candidates only one supports its opening No politicians have to be convinced on that issue anymore said Jane R Devine a Democratic legislator from Huntington who is not seeking reelection Everybody has jumped on that bandwagon The bandwagon according to polls and informal estimates carries more than threequarters of Suffolk voters In view of the united front against the plant Shoreham has hardly been the issue dividing candidates as they walk door to door or face one another at lightly attended local debates Instead according to Mrs Devine the big issue has really been the same old issue Its money money money she said People are worried about taxes They are concerned whether they will be able to hold onto their homes I dont know how many people have stopped me to talk about taxes said Vic Niemi the former Mayor of Amityville and the Republican candidate for the legislative seat that Louis T Howard Republican of Amityville is leaving Mr Howard once Mr Niemis football coach was the only legislator who favored the opening of Shoreham Now Mr Niemi is the sole candidate taking that position But according to Mr Niemi only one person in all the more than 1500 homes he said he has visited during his campaign buttonholed him about his Shoreham views Whether or not I get elected really has nothing to do with Shoreham going on line he said His Democratic opponent Maxine Postal has hammered away at Mr Niemi for his position on the reactor The owner and operator of a private nursery school and kindergarten she will test the strength of antiShoreham feeling in the district In 1983 when State Assemblyman Patrick G Halpin was the Democratic candidate for county executive his position on Shoreham caused some Democratic candidates for the Legislature to seek distance between themselves and the top of the ticket By contrast many Democrats this year are pictured together with Mr Halpin on their campaign literature as Mr Halpin takes a second run for the county post this time as a strong opponent of the plant If Mr Halpin proves to have coattails one beneficiary may be Richard H Schaffer Jr Mr Schaffer has gained public exposure in the Lindenhurst area working as an ombudsman for Mr Halpin also of Lindenhurst Mr Halpin is expected to run well in his home territory An incumbent legislator Gerard Glass of Lindenhurst the Republican candidate came close in January to winning the Legislatures Presiding Officer post But despite the support of the county Republican leadership Mr Glass was edged out by Mr Blass A key vote for Mr Blass came from a Republican legislator Patrick A Mahoney of West Islip who said at the time that Mr Glass was too close to the only proShoreham legislator Mr Howard of Amityville I had a fear that all our hard work to convince the public we were antiShoreham would be lost Mr Mahoney said last week Perception means so much Mr Mahoney a former detective in the County Police Department is expected to win reelection in his race with Frances Beringer a Bay Shore Democrat The incumbent is also the Conservative and RighttoLife candidate A number of Democrats are also running on the People Against Lilco line Mr Mahoney is one of eight Republicans with Conservative endorsement The Legislatures two incumbent Conservatives Rose Caracappa of Selden and Michael D ODonohoe of Northport are seeking reelection with Republican crossendorsement The two Conservatives and nine Republicans candidates also appear on the RighttoLife line a designation that marks them as strong opponents of abortion It is the Conservative endorsements that have some Democrats concerned In addition to tipping close elections in favor of candidates they endorse the county Conservatives are also pressuring the legislators this year to place the question of abolishing the County Legislature before Suffolk voters in a referendum Steven Englebright an incumbent Democrat from Setauket in a hotly contested race to win a third term said he believes that the abolition movement is really a covert effort to undermine the county position on Shoreham Mr Englebright noted that the legislators came within one vote in July of placing the referendum on the November ballot The people who are soft on Shoreham have gone underground and are saying publicly that they are against the plant he said But at the same time they talk about allowing the destruction of the institution that is the keystone for holding the opposition together Mr Englebright said he believed that Republican Party officials supported a Shoreham opening and prevailed on the Conservatives to wage an abolition drive to weaken the countys stance Supporters of a Shoreham opening he said would argue for abolition insted of openly taking an unpopular proShoreham position Peter Pitsiokos a lawyer and Mr Englebrights Republican opponent dismissed the view as demagoguery and rhetoric Steve is just groping for an issue said Mr Pitsiokos who said he thought the public has a right to vote on the abolition question although he himself favors retention of the Legislature If it were abolished the Legislature would be replaced by county government by the 10 Suffolk Town Supervisors whose votes would be weighted according to the population of their towns The system would be similar to county government in Nassau Mr Mahoney the West Islip Republican said he agreed with Mr Englebright that the Republican leadership favored abolition But he said the leaders were motivated by inroads Democrats have made in the county body and not by a wish to support the opening of Shoreham But Mr Blass the Republican Presiding Officer seemed to think that Mr Englebright might have a point Many of the Republican leaders in western Suffolk really feel the Shoreham plant is not so bad he said They are not going to say so publicly but they will use the abolition issue Mr Blass who was elected to his first term in 1979 has been penalized by Republican leaders in the Town of Riverhead where he resides because he supported an insurgent in a Republican and Conservative primary for town supervisor Town Republicans have refused to campaign for Mr Blass as a result But the popular incumbent seems to need little or no assistance from the party to win reelection His Democratic opponent Richard L Caggiano of Southold a political newcomer is depicting Mr Blass as less than honest in his dealings with constituents and officeholders Thats just a tag Mr Blass said They dont have anything specific But Mr Caggiano has been telling voters that Mr Blass appeared to downplay his antiShoreham position two years ago when Mr Blass was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the House of Representatives On the South Fork the decision of an incumbent Democratic legislator Tony Bullock to run for East Hampton town supervisor has put his legislative seat up for grabs The Republican candidate Fred W Thiele Jr a lawyer from Sag Harbor with experience in town and state government appears to have an edge over the Democrat James F Matthews an optician from Southampton making his first run for public office Some supporters of Mr Matthews say he had less than wholehearted support from South Fork Democrats But the Democrats are hopeful of picking up a seat in Smithtown where a Democrat Seth A Lee the victor in a September primary against a leader of the antiShoreham movement faces an incumbent Republican Michael M DAndre whose margin of victory in 1985 was slim Mr DAndre once depicted by Shoreham foes as unreliable on the issue is emphasizing his antiShoreham position in his campaign literature this year It pictures him standing in front of the plant Another incumbent in a tight race is Steven Levy Democrat of Holbrook whose Republican challenger George P Schimpf of Bayport made a local name for himself by leading a charge to lower school taxes in the BayportBlue Point School District In Islip Town George Nolan a Democrat will try to win the seat that his brother Philip C Nolan left to run for Islip town supervisor The Republican and Conservative candidate in the race is Thomas R Finlay a businessman from East Islip With registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 266000 to 152000 the Democratic candidates must depend on winning substantial support among Republicans to win The 142000 voters registered as independents also determine the outcome of races The legislators serve twoyear terms and are responsible for helping run a county government with an annual budget that now exceeds 1 billion
Reagan Renews Appeal to Act Soon on Nominee,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/us/reagan-renews-appeal-to-act-soon-on-nominee.html,President Reagan insisted anew today that the Senate should act quickly on his nomination of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg to the Supreme Court saying he wanted no delays to gear up opposition or support for this nomination The Presidents language was more restrained than on Thursday when he spent almost as much time criticizing the Senate for its treatment and defeat of his earlier nominee Judge Robert H Bork as he did in introducing the new nominee Senate Democrats were irritated by the remarks and the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd said Friday The Senate will not be stampeded Nonetheless Mr Reagans criticism continued today in his weekly radio address He chastised the Senate for the campaign of pressure politics we saw during the consideration of Judge Borks nomination A Product of Circumstances Marlin Fitzwater the chief White House spokesman said the Presidents aggressive stance is just a product of the circumstances adding We just went through a nomination that failed and the process that was used called for comment The Presidents tone reflects his experience with Judge Bork Last week the Senate after a long and bitter fight defeated the nomination of Judge Bork by a vote of 58 to 42 Supporters of Judge Bork have said the White House let the judges opponents seize the initiative Hes not going to let that happen again an Administration official said Friday Mr Reagan said in his radio address which was taperecorded in Washington on Friday before he left for Phoenix to attend his motherinlaws funeral that the public has a right to expect nothing less than prompt hearings The President did not specifically insist as he did on Thursday that Judiciary Committee hearings begin before the Senates Thanksgiving recess Some senators said Friday that they doubted they would be ready for hearings that quickly especially since Judge Ginsburg has written very little that could give researchers a clear idea of his views on such constitutional issues as abortion civil rights and the seperation of church and state Bar Groups Rating Is Crucial In addition the American Bar Association which offers ratings of judicial nominees is expected to take several weeks preparing its evaluation of Judge Ginsburg The bar associations rating may be especially important because it gave Judge Ginsburg only a qualified rating last year when he was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia That is the lowest of three possible approval ratings Nevertheless Mr Fitzwater said the President would still like the hearings to be held before the Thanksgiving recess There doesnt seem to be any good reason for a delay he said Mr Reagan said Judge Ginsburg has a distinguished legal career and is the kind of Justice I want on the Supreme Court Judge Ginsburg has little in his record to suggest how he would rule on criminal justice issues But Mr Reagan said Our courts must protect the rights of all Americans and that includes the rights of the victims of crime and of society not just of criminals I beleive that Judge Ginsburg will do just that
Ethics Agency Sets Ginsburg Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/us/ethics-agency-sets-ginsburg-inquiry.html,The Office of Government Ethics said today that it would open an inquiry into the conduct of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg President Reagans nominee for the Supreme Court in handling a major case for the Justice Department bearing on the cabletelevision industry while he held stock in a cable company Donald E Campbell acting director of the agency said he would not comment on the case until his office had reviewed the facts I hope you understand the sensitivity he said in a brief interview The review was apparently initiated in response to a report by The Associated Press on Judge Ginsburgs role in the case over the weekend It disclosed that he owned almost 140000 worth of stock in a cable TV company while he was directing a Justice Department effort to have the Supreme Court extend First Amendment privileges to cable operators The White House strongly defended Judge Ginsburg today saying through Marlin Fitzwater the Presidents spokesman that his behavior in the cable case did not contain even the appearance of a conflict of interest Reagan Not Troubled President Reagan asked by reporters if he was bothered by Judge Ginsburgs conduct replied No not at all He spoke while he was touring the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he attended the swearingin of William S Sessions as the new Director of the bureau The Office of Government Ethics was created in 1978 to monitor compliance with Federal conflict of interest laws It has the right to order corrective action where it determines that conflicts exist Justice Department regulations spell out procedures for seeking authorization to participate in cases where an individual has a financial interest The employee is directed to seek out the head of his or her division but Mr Ginsburg was then head of the antitrust division The regulations say the ultimate decision should be made by the Deputy Attorney General who was not consulted in this case Lawmakers said the judge would face stiff questioning on his handling of the cable case I certainly want to ask him about this said Senator Patrick J Leahy of Vermont a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee Every judge has to avoid even the appearance of a conflict so we should look into this The interest in Judge Ginsburgs financial holdings pointed up the almost desperate search for information about the 41yearold nominee whose personal traits and legal opinions are largely unknown This search extended to the judges wife Dr Hallee Morgan an obstetrician who is no longer practicing In response to reporters questions the White House today said that Dr Morgan had performed two abortions and assisted on a third while serving her medical residency Wife Is Not the Nominee Dr Morgan later made a personal decision not to perform these kinds of operations Mr Fitzwater said He added that her views were not relevant to the judges confirmation The judges wife is not the nominee Mr Fitzwater said She has a separate career trained under the standards of the medical community There is intense interest in Judge Ginsburgs views on the abortion issue since the remaining eight justices on the Supreme Court appear to be evenly divided on the wisdom of the Courts decision in Roe v Wade the 1973 case that legalized abortions The Administration has tried without success to push legislation through Congress that would reverse that decision And it is clearly hoping that the next justice would provide a key vote in overturning or at least narrowing a womans right to choose an abortion Not Asked About Abortion Mr Fitzwater said today that the White House never asked Judge Ginsburg or his wife about their attitudes toward abortion before the judge was selected for the High Court And there was some indication today that Judge Ginsburg might disappoint the most ardent foes of abortion In interviews his former colleagues at Harvard Law School spoke of his independent turn of mind As far as his stands on social issues are concerned said Steven M Shavell a professor of law and economics there is no reason for liberals to fear they would have an ideologue on the Supreme Court who would work against them Douglas Ginsburg was head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department when it filed a friendofthecourt brief in a Los Angeles case in 1986 The brief argued that cabletelevision systems could not be barred from operating in a certain area a view that was later adopted by the Supreme Court The ruling could mean less regulation and more profitability for cable systems At the time Mr Ginsburg owned stock in Rogers Communications a Canadian company with cable interests in the United States Talked With His Deputy He sought the advice of his deputy Charles F Rule about the propriety of his role in the case He decided to continue his involvement because the courts ruling however it came out would not have affected the value of his holdings said an Administration official familiar with case The White House endorsed the judges assessment today Its been viewed by any number of our attorneys and others Mr Fitzwater said and we find not even the appearance of a conflict of interest But that view was not shared by some experts in legal ethics Monroe H Freedman a professor at the Hofstra University School of Law said This is an ethical lapse Its something that should be raised should be noted by the Senate It would have been smarter for him just to stay out of the case But I would not consider this in itself to be a disqualifying factor Prof Stephen Gillers of the New York University Law School noted that Judge Ginsburg had not consulted the proper authority in the Justice DepartmentI certainly want to know why he didnt go beyond a subordinate who presumably would tell him what he wants to hear said the professor
Ginsburg> A Quiet Life Turns Public,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/us/ginsburg-a-quiet-life-turns-public.html,Judge Douglas H Ginsburg and his wife Dr Hallee Morgan were living quietly in northwest Washington enjoying classical music good books daily swims in their backyard pool and occasional forays into the kitchen to concoct what their friends describe as gourmet dinners Then Judge Ginsburg a 41yearold member of the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia was nominated to the Supreme Court and the Ginsburgs found themselves under the Washington microscope What are his views on privacy What are her views on abortion Last Thursday morning Dr Morgan an obstetrician who is currently not practicing medicine but devoting herself to bringing up their 2yearold daughter readily answered the telephone  only to have to excuse herself abruptly when her daughter Hallee in a tussle with the family dog ended up scratched and bleeding This week however the Ginsburgs have gone discreetly underground A recorded message answers calls to their home You have reached the home of Douglas Ginsburg and Hallee Morgan We are sorry we are unable to come to the phone at the moment No Paper Trail It has been said that Judge Ginsburg with less than a year on the bench has left no paper trail to pursue for his views on such issues as abortion and privacy So all kind of tea leaves are being read People are seizing on every scrap of information about his family personality and way of life for example there is the fact that his daughter Hallee bears her mothers surname which is also her grandmothers name Hallee Morgan When the grandmother is visiting says Robert P Bedell a friend and colleague from the Office of Management and Budget it can get mighty confusing Judge Ginsburgs daughter from his first marriage Jessica de Secundy a 17yearold student at Choate the preparatory school also uses her mothers surname rather than Ginsburg According to Judge Ginsburgs first wife Claudia de Secundy it was her husbands idea He wanted somehow to preserve the history of my family Ms de Secundy said in an interview He said there were lots of Ginsburgs around No one else in my family was having kids Married on May 31 1968 in a synagogue Primarily because of his mother neither of us was particularly religious explained Ms de Secundy the couple did not join a congregation after their marriage Although she was involved with a civil rights group and a nuclear disarmament group in those years her husband was not a political activist He respected my involvement but he wasnt an activist in that way  he wasnt political said Ms de Secundy She added however that Judge Ginsburg supported Robert F Kennedys Presidential bid in 1968 Issue of Abortion The Ginsburg nomination is supported by the National RighttoLife Committee though his views on abortion are not known Some people have cited the fact that Judge Ginsburgs wife Dr Morgan performed two abortions and assisted in another during her residency at a hospital as if that would shed light on his position on the issue The Justice Department confirmed today that Dr Morgan performed abortions as part of her medical training at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston in her first year of residency in 197980 In her next year of training she agreed to assist with a particularly difficult abortion but has performed none since said Terry Eastland of the Justice Department Ms de Secundy said I dont think he would want legislation that would keep a black person from having an abortion because she was poor and letting a white person have one because she could afford it But he also believed that abortion shouldnt be used as birth control Pregnancy because of rape may be a different issue Ms de Secundy recalled that Judge Ginsburg had once advised a friend who had been raped to have a DC immediately referring to the procedure for scraping the uterus Ms de Secundy has remarried and she says that she and Judge Ginsburg have remained close As for his politics she observed Hes conservative when he believes it is right to be conservative hes liberal when he believes it is right to be liberal Karen Hastie Williams a Washington lawyer who lobbied against the unsuccessful nomination of Judge Robert H Bork to the Supreme Court worked with Judge Ginsburg in 1974 and 1975 when they both served as law clerks to Justice Thurgood Marshall They keep touch with an occasional lunch she said I am thrilled with his nomination said Mrs Williams I think he would do a superb job He is bright articulate thoughtful and he approached all the work we were doing at the time in a thoughtful and methodical way He Is Not a Bork Clone She feels he is ill cast as a conservative He is not a Bork clone she argued I think Mr Reagan and Mr Meese have jumped to conclusions as a result of his work in antitrust and the economic and regulatory areas With respect to his views on social issues I think he will look at the facts and precedents and make a reasoned judgment I may not find that I agree with all his decisions but he recognizes the Supreme Court as the court of last resort in this country and I am confident he will come to it with an open mind and with no preconceived agenda In the period they worked together she said they had no occasion to draft any issues that dealt with landmark cases But not even in informal conversations said Mrs Williams who is black do I recall Doug being a zealot on any issue or ever taken a position that I would have found personally offensive There is no question that Doug is a conservative in his public life and in his private life said Mr Bedell but I dont think you could ever regard him as a ideologue He doesnt resolve disputes or issues on the basis of dogma or doctrine especially legal problems He takes the law as he finds it and applies it as a judge would Judge Ginsburg and Dr Morgan met in Cambridge when he was on the faculty at Harvard Law School and she was pursuing a medical degree A native of Tenafly NJ Hallee Perkins Morgan was a graduate of the University of Colorado and the Chicago Medical School The Ginsburg family remains close according to the judges sister Sandra Stein 50 an assistant dean of students at Cornell Each year their mother Katherine who lives in Chicago a brother Robert 52 and their families get together a number of times Their father Maurice Ginsburg who died in 1980 was a selfeducated man she said He exerted a strong influence on all of us she said It was my father who taught us to play chess and do carpentry and gardening and riding How I wish he were here for this We are all so excited and thrilled for Doug  our thoughts and our prayers are with him
ABORTION RIGHTS OF MINORS WEIGHED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/04/us/abortion-rights-of-minors-weighed.html,The Supreme Court heard arguments today on the emotionally charged issue of how far states may restrict minors access to abortions so as to promote consultation with their parents Deputy Attorney General Michael J Hayes of Illinois urged the Justices to uphold the constitutional rights of parents to help nurture their children and the states obligation to protect minors from their own immaturity He said the Court could do so by reinstating a state law regulating abortions for minors The 1983 Illinois law generally requires abortionseeking girls under the age of 18 either to wait 24 hours after both parents have been formally notified or to go to state court and ask a judge to bypass the requirements for notification and the waiting period The law was struck down by Federal district and appellate courts before it took effect on the ground that it was too much of a burden on minors seeking abortions Provision Called Traumatizing A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union representing physicians who perform abortions and a class of minors who seek abortions argued that the law would traumatize pregnant teenagers and perhaps endanger their health by forcing long delays Colleen K Connell the lawyer also said the speculative hope of promoting more family consultation could not justify the burden imposed by the law on pregnant minors Many young women who become pregnant come from broken families Ms Connell said and fear that telling one or both parents might provoke an irrational or violent reaction She said the young women might seek illegal abortions rather than subject themselves to the traumatic experience and possible long delays involved in seeking judicial approval to waive the notification requirement She also urged the Court to throw out the states appeal on the technical ground that the Federal appeals court decision was not not sufficiently final to warrant Supreme Court review Mr Hayes said the law was not unduly burdensome because it provided a judicial bypass procedure for those minors who were mature enough to make their own decisions or whose best interests would not be served by parental notification The opposing lawyers disagreed over whether that procedure was as confidential and expeditious as previous Supreme Court decisions require Similar Laws in 23 States The Illinois case Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 is important because at least 23 states have passed laws requiring either parental notification or parental consent before minors can obtain abortions About half of those laws are not being enforced because of court injunctions or because they do not include judicial bypass procedures which the Court has required in prior decisions In its six previous decisions on minors access to abortions the Court has created a complex set of rules that have left groups on both sides of the issue unhappy The Justices have struck down laws that give parents an absolute veto over their daughters decisions saying that a prompt and expeditious judicial bypass procedure must be available both for minors deemed by the courts to be mature enough to make their own decisions and for immature minors whose best interests would be served by having abortions without parental consent But in upholding state requirements that minors submit to such a court procedure if they want to have abortions without telling their parents the Court has reasoned that immature minors could benefit from governmental encouragement to consult their parents Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who retired June 26 was often the key vote for the majority in 5to4 decisions on abortion issues and many experts have speculated that the Court may be deadlocked on such issues as long as his seat remains vacant In the Illinois case a Federal appeals court ruled 2 to 1that the state could require parental notification or judicial approval but that the 24hour waiting period was too burdensome because it might cause much longer delays increased costs and medical risks The appeals court held that it was premature to decide the constitutionality of the judicial bypass procedures until the Illinois Supreme Court had issued rules governing appeals by minors The appeals court barred all enforcement of the law pending further action by the state court Wounded Knee Arguments WASHINGTON Nov 3 AP  The Supreme Court with three Justices disqualifying themselves has canceled arguments in a case stemming from an armed confrontation in 1973 between Federal agents and Indians at Wounded Knee SD Court sources said today The Court was scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on whether to kill a lawsuit accusing the Federal officials of violating the rights of Indians But sources who requested anonymity said Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia disqualified themselves from taking part That left only five members available to hear arguments one short of the required quorum of six The arguments could be rescheduled after the Supreme Court vacancy is filled
"Politics, Labels and Judge",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/04/us/politics-labels-and-judge.html,Judge Douglas H Ginsburg who was nominated last week to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court has been described variously as a conventional conservative and as a libertarian While politicians and scholars said in interviews today that they did not know enough about Judge Ginsburgs views to know whether either of the labels applied to him they agreed on the distinction between the terms The brand of conventional conservatism that has been the dominant philosophy of the Reagan Administration holds that government has a responsibility to enforce the traditional mores of society Some adherents of this view would limit the Federal Governments powers but expand those of state and municipal governments On the other hand libertarians believe the paramount duty of government is to insure individual freedoms Divisions on Many Issues The division is apparent on such issues as abortion pornography school prayer and the rights of criminal suspects Traditional conservatives believe government has the constitutional authority to outlaw abortion and pornography require prayers in public schools and restrict the rights of people suspected of criminal activity They accept regulation of business to the degree that it improves economic efficiency and believe the Supreme Court should normally defer to the judgments of the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government Libertarians take issue with the idea that government ought to act in those ways Some even oppose the income tax and most military spending although most libertarians accept a minimal role for government in peoples lives But they believe strongly that the Supreme Court should actively protect individuals against intrusion by legislatures and executives Pornography Issue Cited Edward H Crane president of the Cato Institute a research organization advocating the libertarian point of view said that libertarians generally agree with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union on questions of individual freedom He said they break with the ACLU on business issues with libertarians favoring an unfettered free market Prof M E Bradford of the University of Dallas a scholar on conservative thought said a distinction between the factions can be seen on the question of regulating pornography Professor Bradford who described himself as an oldline conservative said he thought pornagraphy should be outlawed to protect the society from having its traditional moral values trammeled Libertarians tend to believe that the First Amendment protection of speech and the press permits pornography however offensive it might be to most people
Ginsburg Faces Queries Over Cable TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/04/us/ginsburg-faces-queries-over-cable-tv.html,Concern grew among Republican senators today that Judge Douglas H Ginsburgs nomination to the Supreme Court could be imperiled by charges of conflict of interest and the Senate Republican leader summoned the nominee to the Capitol to explain his involvement in decisions affecting regulation of the cable television industry Neither Judge Ginsburg nor Senator Bob Dole the Senate minority leader made a public statement after the private halfhour meeting in Mr Doles office Earlier the Kansas Senator told reporters that he was withholding judgment on the nomination in part because I want to find out about the cable thing Judge Ginsburg owned nearly 140000 worth of stock in a cable television company when as a Justice Department official he handled several matters involving the cable industry In interviews today senior Republican members of the Judiciary Committee as well as other influential Republicans who usually support President Reagan expressed concern that the nomination seemed to facing serious obstacles from both the right and the left Other developments today added to the impression that the Ginsburg nomination was suddenly on the defensive only five days after President Reagan selected the 41yearold judge and less than two weeks after the Senate rejected Mr Reagans Supreme Court nominee Judge Robert H Bork New questions about Mr Ginsburgs actions at the Justice Department were raised in a letter from the Democratic chairman of a House committee to the Senate Judiciary Committee which will hold hearings on the nomination probably beginning next month The writer Representative John H Dingell Democrat of Michigan chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce told the Judiciary Committee of Mr Ginsburgs involvement in the destruction of documents at the Justice Departments antitrust division in 1985 Mr Dingells committee was conducting an inquiry into the antitrust ramifications of the sale of the Governments interest in the Consolidated Rail Corporation Never Completely Satisfied In his letter Mr Dingell said I was never completely satisfied with Judge Ginsburgs explanation of his own conduct Judge Ginsburg had ordered his staff to destroy drafts of a letter he wrote Mr Dingell said adding I was troubled by his seeming minimization of the significance of similar actions taken by Justice Department subordinates Mr Ginsburg explained his actions to Mr Dingell in a letter on Dec 20 1985 He told the chairman he had ordered the superseded drafts to be destroyed in order to avoid speculation about views or language that the staff had attributed to me that I did not ultimately adopt as my own Judge Ginsburgs supporters were attempting today to deflect another possible source of trouble concern among antiabortion groups that the nominee is not firmly opposed to abortion Judges Wife and Abortion Several conservative Republicans said that antiabortion activists were dismayed to learn that Judge Ginsburgs wife Dr Hallee Morgan an obstetrician and gynecologist had performed abortions Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah stressing in an interview that to him it is irrelevant what her viewpoint is said that he had telephoned Dr Morgan to discussed the matter Senator Hatch said that Dr Morgan had told him that she had performed abortions during her medical training but that she had gradually come to the conclusion that she would prefer not to perform the operation and did not plan to do so in the future Performing abortions Senator Hatch said very much upset her Senator Hatch who has close ties to antiabortion groups said that if anybody asks me Ill tell them about his conversation with Dr Morgan Judge Ginsburgs own views about abortion are not known The Justice Department denied an account in The New York Times today that suggested the nominee at least at one point in his life was other than absolutely opposed to abortion under all circumstances The Times quoted Judge Ginsburgs first wife Claudia de Secundy as saying that her exhusband once advised a friend who had been raped to have a D and C immediately referring to dilation and curettage a medical procedure that can be used to terminate pregnancy at an early stage Terry Eastland the Justice Department spokesman said the account was inaccurate and that Judge Ginsburg had never counseled his friend to take any action related to the possibility that the rape could have resulted in pregnancy Asked today whether he had ever advised a friend to have a D and C procedure Judge Ginsburg replied I did not In a telephone call interview today Claudia de Secundy said I think I messed up She said her former husband had not in fact advised the friend to have a D and C She meant to say she said that he had advised the friend to go to a hospital The office of Government Ethics has opened an investigation into Judge Ginsburgs participation in the cable television matters At the Justice Department he supervised an antitrust investigation of the cable industry and handled a brief in a Supreme Court case successfully arguing that the First Amendment protected cable operators against certain types of local regulation Marlin Fitzwater the Presidents spokesman said today We are confident that when they have reviewed all the facts they will find no conflict A Little Uneasiness But Republican senators said today that they were not certain the matter could be quickly put to rest The question was discussed at the Republican senators weekly lunch today Afterward one conservative Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona said that he was starting to hear a little uneasiness about the nomination He predicted that there is going to be a lot more reluctance by senators to make early commitments to support the nomination We want to do a lot of investigation Senator McCain said The burden is on him to show hes a viable nominee I wouldnt say there is a perception of vulnerability but there is a perception of weakness Earlier in the day the status of the Ginsburg nomination was discussed at a White House meeting of Mr Reagan and Congressional Republican leaders Leaving the meeting Senator Dole was asked why he had so far not offered a wholehearted endorsement of Judge Ginsburgs nomination I want to find out about the cable thing the Republican leader replied He added Ive only met the guy for five minutes and went on One mistake made in the Bork nomination is that everybody got out on a limb before the hearings started Some Republicans particularly conservatives have said White House mishandling was to blame for last months Senate rejection of Judge Bork Some Republicans warned today that it was important for the Reagan Administration to act decisively now that the latest nomination has suddenly been thrown on the defensive Precisely Whats Involved Its very important that all the facts get out as quickly as possible Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania a moderate Republican said after todays lunch We need to know precisely whats involved how much stock he held who he told what to what the specific ethical rules were Its advisable for him or the Justice Department or the White House to make these facts available Senator Specter a member of the Judiciary Committee who voted against Judge Borks nomination said the matter would be explored fully at Judge Ginsburgs confirmation hearings But he added One of the problems is that if there is an erroneous perception created now thats hard to correct later We dont want any snowballs rolling that are not correct Let the chips fall where they may Were all prepared to stand by the facts Both the White House and Justice Department have strongly defended Judge Ginsburgs actions pointing out that the Canadianbased company in which the nominee held stock Rogers Communications was not a party to the cases Mr Ginsburg handled
"At Dartmouth, A Helping Candor",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/education/at-dartmouth-a-helping-candor.html,DURING registration at Dartmouth College students can pick up forms course material and a sexeducation packet containing a condom a dental dam for oral sex and an explicit pamphlet explaining how to have safer sex in the era of AIDS When they go to the library they can also get a condom when they check out a book In small informal gatherings marked by lighthearted humor in fraternities sororities and allcoed dormitories student team leaders trained by the college health center discuss abstinence as well as the use of various contraceptives which are available at cost on campus At the center of Dartmouths aggressive effort to include sex education along with health education is feisty 36yearold Dr Beverlie Conant Sloane As director of health education at the college health service she has worked to demystify sexuality and affect student behavior positively by setting up peereducation sessions in which students teach each other about contraception integrating sex education into the liberal arts curriculum and advising students individually and lecturing at other campuses Dr Conant Sloane is part of a growing trend to broaden public health on campus particularly as schools move further away from traditional roles as parents in absentia and toward encouraging students as adults to make their own decisions Many students at Dartmouth know about contraceptives have them and dont use them said Dr Conant Sloane who has a doctorate in social science from Syracuse University Some of them think they are invulnerable Some of them think they are not susceptible to getting AIDS at a time when the Centers for Disease Control is predicting that AIDS will be the number one killer on campus by 1991 Society is sending mixed messages wear musk perfume and guys are going to go after you said Dr Conant Sloane On television or in the movies people have sex and no one talks about contraceptives or responsible behavior Meanwhile society is telling young people to wait until marriage to have sex We have to deal with the biological realities and help people make responsible decisions Dartmouths forums on contraceptive methods and the distribution of its socalled safe sex kit and contraceptives have generated controversy Both Dr Conant Sloane and the college have received vehement criticism from conservative students a few parents and alumni all of whom complain that the sex education programs do little to stress moral values and may encourage students to have sex Though Dr Conant Sloane agrees that abstinence should be mentioned as an option she disagrees with critics about the weight it should have in discussions with students I say that abstinence is definitely a choice but its weighed equally with everything else she said Im willing to discuss morals but my job is not to teach one right value system Parents and churches teach moral values My job is to say These are the facts and to help the students as adults decide what is right for them At the same time other students parents and colleagues elsewhere in health education have praised Dr Conant Sloane Her aggressive stand on sex education her published work in public health and behavioral science and her research on such issues as rural health care in Kenya and emergency health care in urban centers have made her a leader in the publichealth field This year Dr Conant Sloane won an award from the Educational Press Association for her 64page book Partners in Health a widely respected publication for college students that deals with sexuality contraceptives and reproductivehealth issues Students and colleagues say some of her success in winning support for such publichealth issues comes from her intensely personal style Despite her fivefoot frame Dr Conant Sloane is a mountain of energy especially when discussing public health the needs of college students today and what she says is societys ageold inability to talk openly and honestly about sex AT A recent meeting in her office with a small group of students who wanted to start a program of AIDS education in dormitories and fraternities she was anything but professorial With one leg tucked beneath her in an overstuffed wing chair she leaned forward touching students hands or arms engagingly while making points about ways to educate other students How do you feel about saying the words vagina or penis she asked Several students shifted in their seats Language is very important in teaching others she said Im going to teach you how to use anatomical words in positive ways If you are teaching about AIDS and you are uncomfortable about using certain words like anal your feelings will be communicated Her gaze clear and direct darted from one student to another to see if her words registered She has a terrific blend of chutzpah and compassion that make her very effective observed Dr Doryn Davis Chervin a project director at the Education Development Center in Newton Mass and a former associate director of student health at Stanford University She connects with people Dr Conant Sloane says she has been influenced by the works of Margaret Sanger a pioneer in the birthcontrol movement in this country and Margaret Mead the anthropologist and author of Coming of Age in Samoa But much of Dr Conant Sloanes attitudes about sex education and public health in general reflect some of her earlier experiences at Middlebury College in Vermont where she received a bachelor of arts degree in history in 1973 As a student there she helped set up seminars on contraception after several students became pregnant We were trying to help our friends find safe abortions she said Then we began to initiate the sexeducation road shows taking them to dormitories to try to prevent unwanted pregnancies The school was against what we were doing and they called my parents who supported me I think abortions are upsetting Its a bad situation But I do believe in people having choices Dr Conant Sloane who is from Weston Mass said that from her experiences at Middlebury College she developed an interest in womens health issues particularly childbirth and contraception education But her research and professional work experience since her days at Middlebury broadened to include publichealth issues in general For example while she was a research assistant at Syracuse University she studied male and female circumcision childbirth practices and rural healthcare delivery among the Masai and Okiek in Kenya Dr Conant Sloane studied the side effects of stress on elderly people at Syracuse Universitys Gerontology Center and prison health care in New York State for the Family Medicine Program at the University of Rochester With her husband David a social historian at Dartmouth who is on leave to write a book about the history of American cemeteries she has taught classes on the history of medicine at the colleges medical school The couple have no children Dr Conant Sloane holds dear the value of selfesteem especially in regard to personal wellbeing My parents taught me values  they dont believe in sex before marriage  and problem solving Dr Conant Sloane said They taught me to set my own limits They didnt say be home at 10 PM but when are you coming home As a youngster asking about the process of birth she found her parents open and frank Teaching children to feel good about their bodies and sex education can start as soon as a child learns body parts Dr Conant Sloane said There are wonderful sexeducation books for children today When a child asks a question about sex choose an answer you are comfortable with answer the immediate question then wait for the next question For teens and young adults discovering their own sexuality she recommends such books as Sex Roles and Personal Awareness by Barbara Lusk Forisha Sexual Unfolding by Lorna Sarrel and Philip Sarrel and Taking Chances by Christin Luker Anything by Sol Gorden at the Family Life Institute at Syracuse University is good she says Uncomfortable Feelings At the college level Dr Conant Sloane finds some students still uncomfortable with talking to others about their feelings regarding sex Often she said they are afraid of rejection and under the influence of drugs or too much alcohol they may be susceptible to behavior they might later regret Meeting with the students who want to begin AIDS seminars Dr Conant Sloane listened intently as they described how they learned about sex and what students say about sex AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases today Several said they thought students were tired of hearing about AIDS even though they lacked all the facts They also said students considered themselves to be in a lowrisk group for the disease James Bramson 20 a senior studying engineering and physics said the specter of AIDS had done little to change dating behavior And Steve Dettelbach 21 a government major said most sexual activity on campus occurred in the dormitories There are no curfews and its a pretty free rein here Mr Dettelbach said People can get AIDS in a single encounter and you can pass it on to other people Students have several relationships during their time here At Dartmouth a fourmonth relationship is a longterm relationship Sarina Schrager a 21yearold French major said In my experience with my friends there are a lot of problems with communication Some women feel insecure They feel that they have to have sex with a boyfriend if they are going to keep him Neil Friedman also 21 and a senior majoring in biochemstry said his parents told him he should know the consequences of having sex yet he felt uncomfortable hearing the message from them One sophomore Walt Shea a 19yearold studying math and computer science told how he first learned about sex One of my parents bought a book about sex and said Here its in there  Dartmouths approach of including sex education as a part of the comprehensive health services reflects a national trend Today on many college campuses health clinics do more than dispense aspirin and give physical examinations They counsel on alcohol and drug abuse birth control nutrition physical fitness and eating disorders like bulimia and anorexia as a component of aggressive preventive health care College health professionals are also focusing more on developmental issues like selfesteem and communication Selfesteem is very important in personal health Dr Conant Sloane said Sometimes people have bad health habits as a means of selfdestruction or engage in alcohol and other drug abuse because they want to feel high and dont find pleasure in life They are trying to fill an empty place within I want to help students see how wonderful they are My job is to hold a mirror up to them so they can see themselves to help them explore developmental issues when they say Im too fat Nobody loves me or I dont have a boyfriend  The trend toward more sex education as a part of a more comprehensive health care has been encouraged by reports from the United States Surgeon General C Everett Koop and the National Academy of Sciences advocating education as the only way to combat the spread of AIDS Health educators say AIDS has helped draw attention to discussions about other sexually transmitted diseases as well as contraception There has been a real revolution in college health since the mid1970s said Dr Davis Chervin who has initiated similar sex and healtheducation programs at Stanford University A lot of us came into college health centers as the only person to promote health education Now colleges have health departments which speaks to the role of health education in institutions Each of the health issues  nutrition fitness weight management for example  require particular approaches ALTHOUGH institutions like Dartmouth Stanford and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst have been at the forefront of aggressive health education Dr Richard Keeling presidentelect of the American College Association a group of college health professionals and chairman of its task force on AIDS said that the organizations recent survey showed that only about 25 percent of the schools surveyed had undertaken AIDS education What that tells us is that there still are a lot of schools that have not gotten involved in doing education programs said Dr Keeling who is also director of the health service at the University of Virginia and associate professor of internal medicine there The program that Beverlie and her people put in place caused controversy he said because it was explicit and aggressive and widely available A lot of colleges doing sex education have been quiet about it and a lot of colleges that fear controversy are timid about starting AIDSeducation programs Dr Conant Sloane has staked her reputation on shunning approaches restrained by timidity and controversy When we began talking about providing the safer sex packet she said there was some resistance from the campus administration As college health officials we had to have a conviction that what we were doing was right and give the facts about the need for AIDS education which has been supported by the Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences I said we can be on the cutting edge of health education in this country or fall behind Either way we will be criticized
CAN THE MENNONITES SURVIVE SUCCESS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/magazine/can-the-mennonites-survive-success.html,A HANDFUL OF MEN come coasting down the hill on gearless bicycles They are wearing dark widebrimmed straw hats plain blue workshirts and black pants held up by suspenders They round the corner at the end of the cornfield and pull up to a halfconstructed church where 40 or so men most of them farmers are already at work Horses hitched to shiny black buggies snort and swish their tails A table saw whines and hammers pound as freshly cut siding is handed up the scaffolding The Old Order Mennonites an ultraconservative group are raising a church in the rolling farmland of Lancaster County Pa No foreman barks orders no wages will be paid but on the third day of construction the building a rectangular structure with no steeple  nothing to promote pride or encourage vanity  is almost complete A few miles south a very different Mennoniterun construction project is under way Cranes and bulldozers and union crews are completing the second phase of a 1250person retirement community at Willow Valley A familyowned empire on nearly 300 acres of land Willow Valley a combined retirement community corporate and conference center and vacation resort also includes two motels a shopping mall a condominium complex three restaurants several swimming pools a supermarket and a golf course The main motels lobby speaks not of humility but of Dynasty with pink pastel walls Oriental rugs potted palm trees and a gleaming chandelier Sixtysevenyearold John Thomas Sr and his wife Florence founded Willow Valley in 1965 with 8 acres of land and a simple 30unit inn Mrs Thomas still wears a homemade traditional Mennonite dress and a white prayer covering cap on her head But Mr Thomas gave up his plain suit with its black collarless jacket a separation from fashion after the first motel was built around 1970 A few years later he began wearing a tie and now looks no different from any other successful businessman My grandfather was a Mennonite preacher who went to church in a horse and buggy he says My father was one of the first Mennonites to buy a car I flew the Concorde and got back before I left He leans back in his black leather Willow Valley office chair and beams as he adds Thats how far weve come Unlike the Old Orders or the Thomases though most Mennonites feel caught between the traditions of the past and the escalating demands of the present As recently as 20 years ago their austere dress and rigid code of behavior defined and isolated the 25000population Lancaster community the Mennonites cultural base in the United States having been an early major settlement But the life style and isolation that have for three centuries kept the corrupt outside world at arms length are fast disappearing spurred by a local economic boom A burgeoning population rapid residential and commercial growth and a 400millionayear tourist industry contribute to the loss of between 2000 and 8000 acres of Lancaster farmland a year And among many Mennonites farming is giving way to law medicine and real estate development Old values and identities dont die easily but without a selfcontained community to sustain them Mennonites risk being subsumed by a culture they have always considered sinful Whether it is possible to be a professional and humble in the Mennonite sense living within mainstream culture and still not living like it is a question with which many Mennonites must now grapple In the old days we knew how we were different says Emerson Lesher a Mennonite psychologist in Lancaster and author of The Muppie Manual The Mennonite Urban Professionals Handbook for Humility and Success Now we dont know that he says and I feel like were trying to decide if we can still keep this thing together This thing began more than 400 years ago during the Reformation in Europe Mennonites are descended from Swiss and South German Anabaptists whose basic tenets were a belief in adult baptism or baptism upon confession of faith and a commitment to pacifism After the early Anabaptist leaders had been executed by the Swiss French Dutch and South German states the Mennonites who take their name from the Anabaptist leader Menno Simons carried their traditions to the United States in the late 17th century forming what is now known as the Mennonite Church or Old Mennonites With the other main groups the Old Orders the General Conference Mennonite Church and the Mennonite Brethren Church who divide on mostly ideological grounds but overlap somewhat geographically Mennonites now number 190000 in the United States and Canada In Lancaster County as modernization slowly transformed the society around them the Old Mennonites and Old Orders put into practice the biblical injunction to be a light unto the world by appearing noticeably different and by leading a simple landbased life that spurned worldly pleasures and products THE FIRST KRAYBILL in Lancaster County bought his farm in 1772 Sixtysixyearold Simon Kraybill still lives on a farm in the Bossler Corner area But his seven children have all moved away and taken up professions in cities When they were growing up contact with nonMennonites was limited They went to a Mennonite high school and their church served as both a place of worship and a social center On Saturday nights the older children took their dates to church youth meetings where they heard talks on everything from the evils of bowling alleys to the perils of necking and petting At that time I was never quite sure what it was like to pet says Eugene Kraybill 38 who until recently was a reporter for The Lancaster Intelligencer Journal but now lives in Australia I sort of envisioned a dog Restrictions extended to such worldly entertainment as television movies drinking and dancing All the people around us were doing all these things that were wicked and sinful and we didnt says 34yearold Ron Kraybill who holds a Master of Divinity degree from Harvard and serves as director of the Mennonite Conciliation Service It was like we were living on an island of redeemed people in the middle of the heathen I felt very different then and in a sense inferior Ron says When you dont interact with outside people it really creates a sense of living on a minority island Few people questioned why they were different or doubted that the island would last forever I felt very secure in my tradition says 39yearold Elvin Kraybill a Lancaster lawyer There was little ambiguity adds his brother Ron You knew exactly what the limits were The world within those limits was marked by frugality and obedience to authority Flouting of community and church rules was rare Accumulation of wealth was an alien concept One acted as a steward of Gods gifts and took only as much as was necessary Success in the material sense was suspect at best If youre successful youre either immoral or unethical says Dr Lesher Thats been a sort of motif in the culture But to live in such a world meant you looked different even strange and a lot of Mennonites growing up during the 1950s and 60s felt ashamed of their identity The opportunity to shed the visible symbols of that identity came when the young men served in hospitals as conscientious objectors during World War II the Korean War and the Vietnam War And later some of them worked in Mennonite missions in Africa and Central America And when they came home to a booming economy that was geared more toward development and sales than toward the small family farm many of them traded their plain clothes for business suits their Bible studies for therapy sessions But the sense of separateness of coming from a culture with different values remained JUST NORTH OF LANCASTER in the middle of a strip of usedcar dealerships fastfood stores and factory outlets the Chamber of Commerce last summer put up a huge billboard that read Lancaster County The Sweet Smell of Success What do the people who put that billboard up think is success asks Elvin Kraybill My tradition calls us to be faithful and not simply successful The conflict between wealth and faithfulness is something Leon Hurst a 42yearold Mennonite pastor who also runs a profitable construction business confronts every day of the week and twice on Sundays He receives no salary as pastor a position for which he was chosen by lot from the congregation but the building boom has blessed him with enough money to build a large suburbanstyle home with a twocar garage enjoy a television set and to take modest vacations Sitting on a thickcushioned couch in his airconditioned den Mr Hurst explains his churchs attitude toward wealth Affluence often leads to spiritual coldness and indifference You get to the point where you say Im doing quite well without God thank you  But the thought that he might be living quite well without God is a frightening one for Mr Hurst I drive home and look at the way were living and I wonder how good a steward am I The search for the simple life has created a host of seemingly arbitrary rules Merv Stoltzfus moved in the early 1970s from the family farm to study at Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg Va Now an optometrist at the age of 36 he owns a town house in Lancaster and a condominium at the Maryland shore strives to give 10 percent of his income to the church and accepts welfare patients Yet the key to simplicity is still buried somewhere out on the old farm You dont know whats appropriate and what isnt appropriate he says Maybe its not appropriate to own a condo Patterns that were mapped in detail during the old days broke down when Mennnonites left the culture of rooted farming communities You basically feel like youre traveling on uncharted territory says Eugene Kraybill and that can be pretty frightening His brother Ron who lives on the edge of a racially mixed poor section of downtown Lancaster is thinking about working with Mennonite missions abroad Yet he still dreams of retiring to life on a farm in Bossler Corner I still have real roots there he says And sometimes I think who am I to break this link of rootedness For some Mennonites particularly women the struggle has centered not on searching for roots but on breaking loose from them In the Mennonite hierarchy of GodManWoman women were expected to marry young and respect the absolute authority of their husbands Dating was more of a screening process than a romantic adventure according to a Mennonite woman now middleaged who prefers not to be identified She rejected that process I sowed my wild oats she says I resisted what was expected of a single person I was living in a different world from the people who were giving me easy answers In the mid1970s those two worlds collided She became pregnant and had an abortion sinful for a Mennonite The community and family reaction was predictable They said Well if you do that then you could kill a person You have no morals    And I just dont think Im an immoral person She adds They dont even have to choose Its a road map for them Not all modern Mennonites struggle to reconcile rootedness and detachment simplicity and affluence Paul Hurst went from a modest Mennonite dairy farm to alternative service to the military in Boston during the Vietnam War to a lucrative career selling Lancaster County real estate Theres nothing wrong with success the 43yearold realestate man says Its just an end result of being a good steward of our time and of maintaining a good work ethic Nor does he feel any particular attachment to the land Mennonites who sell the family farm at todays pumpedup prices he says are the rightful recipients of the love and care that went into maintaining that land for generations Prime productive land should be protected he believes but he feels that the needs of the present take precedence over sentimental longings for the past If the best use of that land now happens to be for a highway or for residential expansion then that is what is right for today His sentiments are echoed by John Thomas Sr of Willow Valley who contends that God needs good businessmen God has been blessed in recent years by a number of good Mennonite businessmen including the heads of at least halfadozen multimilliondollar companies in Lancaster County The certainty of their success is matched only by the powerful reaction against them in the Mennonite community Ron Kraybill has particularly harsh words for Mennonites who see dollars rather than spiritual values in Lancaster Countys farmland Sometimes I think we dont know what weve got Then I realize that people know enough to package and market it yet it would appear to me that in the end its like throwing pearls to swine MARKETING MENNONITE traditions has rarely been an issue for the Old Order Mennonites who split from the main body of the church more than a century ago The two principal Old Order groups  the Wengers who continue to use the horse and buggy and the Hornings or Black Bumper Mennonites whose cars bumpers are painted black have managed to fend off change since 1927 when the two groups split over use of the automobile In recent years though even they have begun to falter Church teaching stressing strict obedience to authority and separation from a sinful world no longer goes unquestioned at the Upper Weaverland church a white stone meeting house in which the Wengers and the Hornings worship on alternate Sundays Today is Black Bumper Sunday but some of the cars in the parking lot have tips and tails that flash with chrome As the black cars file out of the parking lot two members of the congregation are locked in a discussion about patterns  plain suits and black cars and principles  humility and nonconformity I believe there can be more than one pattern to a principle but I dont know how long a principle can stand if the patterns change says I Mark Nolt 35 a carpenter who works for the Horst Group If theres no pattern applied to modesty do you think the principle stays It can but we rarely see it says Galen Hurst 25 a teacher at a Mennonite elementary school People need reminding says Mr Nolt I think people ought to have a right to wonder why theyre doing something says Mr Hurst THOUGH THE CONTRADICTIONS between belief and life style crop up everywhere there is one place where they have been held at bay It is the Mennonite Ghetto a cluster of more than a dozen households in the povertystricken black and Puerto Rican section of downtown Lancaster known as the Seventh Ward Simplicity for these Mennonites means driving 500 cars and buying clothes at the Salvation Army store Community means checking in on your brothers psyche during 1960sstyle gettogethers or working in Nicaragua on development projects And pacifism stands for supporting the nuclearfreeze movement or withholding taxes that might end up at the Pentagon But an uncompromising radicalism in life style and beliefs links the Mennonite ghetto to the traditional farming community Frank Albrechts harsh version of simplicity might satisfy an ultraconservative Old Order Mennonite He buys his clothes at Goodwill and reuses envelopes which in addition to pleasing God saves paper which conserves forests which helps stop the erosion that damages the worlds food supply Unlike the traditional Mennonites though Mr Albrecht a 29yearold teacher in a public high school stresses integration and action rather than separation and retreat Nor is his expression of pacifism a strictly religious one He harbors Central American refugees in his home and has withheld 50 percent of his taxes from the Government so as not to contribute to the military When the Internal Revenue Service levied 5000 in back taxes and penalties on him his church and the ghetto community came up with the funds Talk about faith he says I didnt know how I was going to pay my bills Simplicity pacifism and a barebones version of a Mennonite community  these values may persist in the alien environment of the Seventh Ward but only a handful of Mennonites choose to live there Most still cling to a farmbred identity that is now little more than a memory to some When Leon Hursts father grew too old to farm he and his wife moved 100 yards up the hill to a small suburbanstyle ranch house Mr Hurst eventually slipped into forgetfulness and confusion and shortly before he died he began to wander outside in the middle of the night Each time he ended up on the farm The first time was right after a rainstorm and Mrs Hurst found him there covered with mud Another time the family who had bought their old house called to tell Mrs Hurst theyd found her husband there Mrs Hurst says So often he said Lets go home and I said You are home Dont you remember But he just couldnt seem to remember Hed walk over to the window and look out at the old farm    That was hard
Learning The Facts of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/education/learning-the-facts-of-life.html,RON MOGLIA wants every 5yearold in America to play the birthing game It goes like this A kindergarten class chooses a girl to be the adult mommy and a boy to be the adult daddy The teacher asks the adult mommy when she wants to have her baby  before lunch before recess or before going home When the big moment arrives the mommy stands by a plastic tube labeled mommys birthing tunnel and starts a classmate who has been designated baby of the day on his or her crawl through As the baby emerges from the end of the tunnel labeled mommys vagina a doctor and a nurse welcome the baby into the world They weigh the child and tell the class whether its a boy or a girl Then everyone runs off for milk and cookies Fifteen years ago the birthing game would have been unthinkable Now with disturbingly high teenage pregnancy rates the AIDS epidemic and widespread fears about other sexually transmitted diseases many publicschool educators believe that sex education is a must Some experts  including Mr Moglia director of the Human Sexuality Program in the Department of Health Education at New York University and Mary S Calderone a cofounder of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States  argue that the earlier sex education begins the better Sandra Ludlow executive director of ETR Associates a California consulting group that has helped more than 300 school districts plan sexeducation programs agrees Schools are recognizing she said that their role involves more than showing girls a movie about menstruation in a homeeconomics class or offering a unit on human reproduction in high school biology If sex education is necessary  surveys have long shown that about 80 percent of Americans favor it in public schools  how is this confusing controversial subject to be taught Are kindergarteners too young to be taught the words penis and vagina Should thirdgraders learn about anal sex and AIDS as the Surgeon General recommends Should fourthgraders discuss sexual safety Should schools be in the business of advocating abstinence suggesting birth control or distributing condoms As school systems across the United States are discovering clearcut answers are painfully elusive Ann WelbourneMoglia executive director of the Sex Information and Education Council known widely by its acronym Siecus pronounced SEEKus and the wife of Mr Moglia says that with the possible exception of desegregation no subject has matched the anger anxiety and intensity of the debate about how schools should teach sex Yet many school districts are ineluctably moving toward what they consider a more realistic approach to sex education Two school systems praised by familylife specialists are in Alexandria Va and Irvington NJ Both teach sex from kindergarten on and both report only scant opposition to either the early start or the explicit nature of the programs Information about sexuality was first discussed in schools around the turn of the century following a sharp rise in sexually transmitted diseases Instructors preached abstinence as a way to put prostitution out of business and thus eliminate the spread of lifethreatening illnesses By the 1950s the subject was mostly taught in homeeconomics or gym classes often by physicaleducation instructors working indoors during the winter months By the 1970s many schools included discussions of the social side of sex  dating and peer pressures US Teen Pregnancy Rate Is Highest Clearly the old sex education failed to prevent teenage pregnancies from skyrocketing Even though the pregnancy rate has remained about the same for the last few years and in fact declined slightly between 1980 and 1983 it is still the highest among Western nations In 1984 for example 56 percent of American teenagers gave birth out of wedlock compared with only 15 percent in 1960 Paradoxically sex education has also become more common Secretary of Education William J Bennett says that nationally 70 percent of publicschool children took some kind of sex education in 1985 up from 60 percent in 1976 But programs vary from state to state town to town even school to school In many schools sex education remains little more than it was 25 years ago According to Siecus only four states Maryland New Jersey Kentucky and Nevada and Washington DC now require it in all schools Even so many experts argue that too little is being done No matter what is written in the curriculum not much is going on out there said Mary Lee Tatum who trains Alexandrias teachers Fewer than 15 percent of US children get really good sex education We are only beginning to institute adequate programs Perhaps to quiet conservatives  or justify snatching the subject from biology and gym classes sex education is now called familylife education The term covers more than reproduction and includes getting along with parents and peers understanding ones own emotions and knowing what to do about sex abuse and AIDS The backtobasics people claim we should just teach reading writing and arithmetic says Linda Lichtenberger a sixthgrade teacher at Irvingtons Grove Street School But you tell me if somebody a child knows is dying of AIDS how will they deal with it We have to help their inner selves Despite the widespread support for what they teach sex educators face powerful critics But after a look at classes in Alexandria and Irvington one wonders why all the fuss In both communities teachers emphasize abstinence until marriage and reinforce other values most parents think their children learn at home The teachers assigned to family life are not wildeyed radicals Mrs Tatum who besides her other duties has taught family life in nearby Falls Church Va for 15 years is also a Sundayschool teacher Joan W Myers the familylife teacher at Alexandrias George Washington Junior High School switched from reading to sex education after discovering that a disproportionate number of her students were the products of teenage pregnancies I thought this would be a great way for kids to learn things theyd need to know the rest of their lives she says To the wellworn argument that such teachings only encourage sexual activity among the young Mrs Tatum says Sex education is essentially a conservative movement calculated to counteract all the junk that kids get in the culture It is a formidable goal Mrs Tatum says that a very popular video cassette in her area is Risky Business the 1983 film about a high school students experiences with call girls I have to let them see that real people dont live this way she says At the elementary level the issues are no less fundamental Familylife specialists hope that when teachers provide accurate answers about sex they create the same kind of foundation for later learning that they provide in English or arithmetic Sexuality is the only subject I can think of that we dont teach young children in a progressive way Mr Moglia says Peggy Brick director of the Center for Family Life Education a nonprofit curriculum advisory group based in Hackensack NJ maintains that if elementary schools sidestep the issue sex education at the secondary level becomes a mostly remedial enterprise struggling to overcome years of accumulated misinformation What if a homosexual mates with another homosexual Can he have a baby It is question time in a fifthgrade class at Alexandrias Cora Kelly School a predominantly black elementary school On the chalkboard the days schedule fills a corner in flawless teacher handwriting Family life comes just after physical education and reading and just before what is called math seatwork For 35 minutes Jean Hunter Alexandrias familylife curriculum specialist has been giving a lesson on feelings and how advertisers try to manipulate them by hiring stars like Bill Cosby Ms Hunter shuttles from class to class after 50 minutes with the fifthgraders she moves on to a fourthgrade room nearby Her goal she says is to make familylife education more than sex by helping students develop a framework for understanding values behavior and culture Once a week Ms Hunter passes out small slips of colored paper for the questionandanswer session The students can write comments or leave the paper blank The exercise encourages children to overcome their fear of being ridiculed by classmates for ignorance To help everyone feel free to bring up sensitive topics she reminds students not to put their names down or shout thats mine when she reads questions aloud Question time is an eagerly awaited segment and the concentration seems even higher than during the rest of the period To the question about homosexuals having a baby the fifthgraders offer a chorus of nos Lets think Ms Hunter says ushering in a review of material the students learned the previous year Can a man have a baby Again a chorus of nos What must there be she asks An egg and a sperm the class answers still mostly in chorus Ms Hunter frowns at the next question The colored slip says How do boys and girls make a baby Whats wrong with this Ms Hunter asks Pausing half a beat she answers herself Men and women make a baby Young kids arent prepared to do this But when an adult man and an adult woman do this the sperm and egg meet where Fallopian tube the class answers Then it grows where Ms Hunter asks In the uterus How does it get from a man to a woman she asks Sexual intercourse There are questions about menstruation triplets and why babies cry when they are born Most of the time Ms Hunter gives matteroffact answers but occasionally a question catches her by surprise How much do abortions cost a colored slip says I dont know that she replies stumbling just a bit There is a whole range Its like when you go to the doctor Some doctors charge 30 some charge less Later Ms Hunter said it was the first time she had been asked that question by students so young THE AIDS EPIDEMIC is also forcing schools to reevaluate their approach to sex education Publichealth experts worry that sexually active teenagers could emerge as a high risk group for AIDS A year ago the Surgeon General Dr C Everett Koop said sex education should start in kindergarten and include information about AIDS A subsequent National Academy of Sciences report warned that the disease could become a catastrophe without a 2 billion education and research campaign among other things The United States Conference of Mayors says 40 of the nations 73 largest school districts have already begun teaching about AIDS and 24 others plan to take it up Despite Dr Koops recommendation most will leave AIDS education to the junior high school level Last month the New York State Board of Regents approved instructional guidelines for a halfyear AIDS course for junior high and senior high students Opponents of sex education argue that telling students to use condoms to prevent AIDS undermines moral resistance to premarital sex and contraception Foes of abortion fear that if the subject is even mentioned students will feel free to take part in casual sex Its an absolute invitation to experimentation asserted Phyllis Schlafly the conservative crusader who first became widely known for her opposition to the proposed equal rights amendment It encourages peer pressure for promiscuity Some surveys however suggest just the opposite After reviewing nine sexeducation plans nationwide Mathtech a Washingtonarea educational consulting firm found that long comprehensive sexeducation programs may have prevented students from becoming more permissive about premarital sex than students who did not take them In Alexandria where AIDS discussions take place as early as the fourth grade students happily declare that the program makes a difference in their lives Well be prepared to know whats happening if something happens said one ninthgrader A Priority on Teacher Training If talking about sex is difficult for parents is it any easier for teachers Not necessarily That is why familylife experts put a priority on teacher training Even a teacher with 38 years experience like Evelyn Schwartz can learn to say penis to a kindergarten class said Claire Scholz head of Irvingtons familylife program referring to a teacher who had gone through her training course I tell people Go home and look in the mirror and say it 10 times Youll densensitize yourself  In Irvington all teachers are required to attend six training workshops taught by Mrs Scholz a school psychologist and certified sex educator You must give teachers that kind of factual material she said You would not expect teachers to teach chemistry without learning the factual material first and you cant expect teachers to teach familylife education without learning that first Evelyn Schwartz admits that she was apprehensive at first This is so detailed she said describing the curriculum she is required to teach But she has mastered the subject In the next few weeks her kindergarteners at Grove Street will memorize the parts of the body Familylife educators say it is important to teach the correct names early before children become accustomed to slang terms Mrs Lichtenberger of Grove Street credits her students perhaps more than she does Mrs Scholz with making her feel comfortable about teaching sex education They werent shocked about any of this she said Maybe I was but they werent In Alexandria one Saturday recently 30 teachers filed into a windowless room and took their seats on hard wooden chairs While they sipped instant coffee from Styrofoam cups Mrs Tatum asked each person to explain why he or she was there Most said they thought family life was an important subject one or two said they had come because the training course was required A ninthgrade teacher said I had three students this week who came in pregnant Mrs Tatum then spoke to them for more than an hour on attitudes about sexuality from St Augustine to John Calvin to Hugh Hefner to Woody Woodpecker Woody Woodpecker Mrs Tatum said that in that cartoon as in many others the main characters eyes pop out and he stops acting rationally whenever a female appears on the scene The message is that women use sex to get the attention of men she said and that men have no defenses Its misleading It essentially says our brains are not in charge of our sexual behavior Its a tragedy for kids to grow up believing that Mrs Tatum said all this was calculated to help the teachers come to real assessment of their own values If they dont understand their own values they cant help young people understand their values and they may dump their own values on the kids FOR YEARS Mr Moglia the familylife specialist has been saying that young children should have sex education He agrees with Dr Koop that AIDS education should begin in the third grade In his view children cannot understand abstract ideas such as viruses and diseases any earlier For the same reason he frowns on building a kindergarten sexeducation program around animals and animal babies even if the mother cat has her kittens right in the classroom The jump from animals to humans is still too abstract at that age he says So why bother with the birthing game which Siecus plans to include in an upcoming curriculum it is publishing Why not wait until later Mr Moglia explains If you introduce AIDS education as a virus that can be transferred from one person to another through intercourse through the passage of body fluids in third grade youll have hysteria on your hands But if you introduce the idea of sex education in kindergarten then youll have the foundation for the child to learn about this virus later That idea has provoked a debate in Virginia between those who think a proposed curriculum does not go far enough and those who think it goes too far Under the plan for a comprehensive sequential familylife curriculum that was circulated at recent public hearings around the state Virginias kindergarteners would learn body parts and functions In third grade they would learn about reproduction In sixth grade they would discuss masturbation and sex outside marriage Under orders from the State Legislature the curriculum must emphasize postponing sexual activity The state Board of Education must recommend a plan of action to the Legislature by next month At a hearing in Alexandria last month few seemed satisfied Jason Hintz a 16yearold told the panel that 44 percent of girls and 60 percent of boys are sexually active and twothirds of pregnant high school girls have abortions This curriculum does not face reality said Mr Hintz who is also a student member of the Fairfax County School Board although he spoke on behalf of the Student Advisory Council of Fairfax representing 130000 students It is watered down with no mention of contraception no mention of abortion or any other sensitive sexual issue When New Jersey mandated familylife education in 1980 the debate was no less intense There state officials ultimately left it to local school districts to decide sensitive issues such as when and how to deal with information about contraception masturbation premarital sex abortion and homosexuality In Irvington a coordinating committee sampled attitudes The high school students specifically asked for birth control and abortion information Mrs Scholz said Parents wanted child abuse and sex abuse taught in kindergarten as the state suggested For Mrs Scholz there is only one problem with her sexeducation course the textbook The colorful illustrated volume that Irvingtons fourthgraders have used since the familylife program began  a book Mrs Scholz raves about  is now out of print She has scanned dozens of others but has yet to find a suitable replacement Faced with a similar problem at the secondgrade level Mrs Scholz wrote her own book So far all she has to show for it is a pile of rejection slips Every letter I get back from publishers says theres not a market for that she said They dont say its that its too controversial SWEDES INSTILL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECADES Sweden has been viewed as a world leader in the field of sex education treating the subject openly and frankly The country has one of the lowest rates of unwanted pregnancy the United States has one of the highest Since 1942 the Swedish Government has endorsed such education for all students beginning at age 7 It has national sex education requirements a national curriculum and even a national handbook to guide teachers No parents group has ever objected to the countrys progressive sex education programs In short the approach is typical of Sweden a small homogeneous nation secular and pragmatic where the belief in statesponsored social reform runs deep American educators who have observed Swedish schools tend to view their sex education programs with admiration and envy but also as a luxury made possible by that countrys tightknit society Masturbation orgasm homosexuality abortion condoms AIDS  all are subjects a Swedish 10yearold might bring up at the dinner table having discussed them that day in school The instruction is designed to be objective not preachy or moralizing Still Swedish educators do not view their approach as value free sex education by any means We dont tell students what they should and shouldnt do says Dr Annika Strandell chief medical officer of Swedens National Board of Education but we start a dialogue with them about sexuality and responsible behavior The values Swedish sex education is promoting Dr Strandell emphasizes are those of intimacy in relations with other people and that sex on the basis of personal intimacy satisfies a basic human need Sexuality is treated as a natural part of education about people living together she notes rather than in terms of the mechanics of reproduction In fact foreigners familiar with Swedish sex education are most impressed by this general approach not necessarily the content of its courses which includes 12 hours of classroom instruction for teenagers The strength of Swedish sex education has more to do with attitudes than with teaching technical matters noted Dr Mary Calderone a pioneer of American sex education adjunct professor of human sexuality at New York University and coauthor of The Family Book About Sexuality The Swedes recognize that sexuality is part of being human and that sexual relations revolve around selfrespect and respect for other people Despite its longstanding commitment to sex education Sweden has given the subject added emphasis and attention since 1975 when free abortions upon request became national policy The step was taken in the name of social reform and feminism but it worried many parents We were very much afraid that there would be a terrible increase of abortion in Sweden recalled Carl Gustof Boethius secretary of a Government commission to revamp sex education in the mid1970s But that did not happen Instead the Government increased the amount of sex education concerning contraception for teenagers in particular and made contraceptives more easily available to young people through state health clinics Since 1974 the number of abortions performed on women aged 15 to 19 years old has fallen from 28 per 1000 to less than 20 per 1000 Moreover since the strengthening of sex education programs in the mid1970s the number of pregnancies among women in the same age group has dropped from 60 per 1000 women in 1974 to about 30 per 1000 today By contrast the number of pregnancies in the United States for the same age group is 97 per 1000 and rising And Sweden has fewer early usually unwanted pregnancies even though Swedish teenagers are sexually active at a younger age than American teenagers According to one study 80 percent of Swedish 18yearolds have had sexual intercourse compared with roughly 60 percent of American 18yearolds In Dr Strandells view the conclusion to be drawn is obvious If you have the right kind of education she says you can change young peoples attitudes and behavior In the US Dr Strandell continued much of the advice given amounts to saying Dont do it But that doesnt stop them because you have all those unwanted pregnancies Steve Lohr
Administration Renews Struggle To Agree on an Acceptable Choice,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/us/administration-renews-struggle-to-agree-on-an-acceptable-choice.html,After the successive failures of two nominations to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court the White House and the Justice Department must again search for a nominee whose ideological credentials can satisfy Republican conservatives and still permit confirmation in a Democraticcontrolled Senate If the task was difficult before Judge Douglas H Ginsburgs withdrawal today it has since become much more complicated Angry conservative lawmakers and lobbying groups still smarting over the Senate defeat last month of President Reagans first choice Judge Robert H Bork are now reeling from the embarrassing disclosures that led to Judge Ginsburgs withdrawal Factional Disputes The search is also complicated by factional disputes within the Administration Judge Ginsburg was reportedly the choice urged on the President by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and the conservative faction in the White House Today Administration officials said that among the frontrunners to replace Judge Ginsburg is Anthony M Kennedy a Federal appellate judge who was backed the last time by the White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr and others whom conservatives blamed for not working hard enough to prevent the defeat of Judge Bork Judge Kennedy who sits on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California and Judge William W Wilkins of Greenville SC who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit are said by White House officials to be among the frontrunners to be the next nominee Even as Judge Ginsburg was announcing his withdrawal and Republican leaders from both the moderate and conservative wings of the party were stressing the importance of having a new nominee in place quickly the recriminations about White House bungling and factionalism were flying The first time they threw Bork out there to twist in the wind and told us to stay out of it said Craig Shirley a conservative political consultant Then they put up somebody and say Heres a good conservative invite all of the conservatives over to the White House and come to find out they didnt do their homework Blames the President The blame goes to the President said Richard Viguerie a conservative publisher and fundraiser who has been especially critical of Mr Baker for his handling of the bruising battle over Judge Bork The President doesnt have an ideologically consistent Administration and they didnt think this through Were holding our breath now on whether Howard Baker will prevail Mr Viguerie continued It would be a disaster to the President if he appointed a moderate At some point the President has to take a stand to draw the line If he surrenders now were going to have a disastrous next 14 months Senator Joseph R Biden Jr the Delaware Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a brief statement urging Mr Reagan to act promptly in naming a new nominee I hope the Administration will send us a nominee soon he said We need to fill the vacancy at the court as quickly as possible Dole Urges Caution But Bob Dole the Senate Republican leader who is a candidate for his partys Presidential nomination advised caution In a statement that hinted at but did not directly mention Judge Ginsburgs disclosures about smoking marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s Mr Dole said he respected Judge Ginsburgs decision to pull out and that while it was unfortunate the time had come to move on I urge the President to proceed with caution and to make certain the next nominee is asked all the right questions Mr Dole said White House officials said the next nominee would certainly be asked whether he or she had ever used drugs White House and Justice Department officials offered conflicting accounts in the last few days about whether Judge Ginsburg was asked the question before he was nominated Mr Dole met privately with Judge Ginsburg last Tuesday to discuss disclosures about the judges holdings in a cable television company at the time he was a Justice Department official acting on cable television regulatory matters The Senator said on Friday that he had asked Judge Ginsburg if there was anything else in his past that might prove an embarrassment to the President and that Judge Ginsburg had said no Sympathy for Ginsburg Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed that he was among 20 to 30 senators who had urged the White House to withdraw the nomination after Judge Ginsburgs disclosures Judge Ginsburg is an able judge and it is most unfortunate that this situation has arisen Mr Thurmond said Other senators and some conservative lobbyists spoke of their personal sympathy for Judge Ginsburg and his ordeal in the last few days I applaud Judge Ginsburgs acting so promptly because the country needs to move ahead and fill the Supreme Court vacancy said Senator Arlen Specter the Pennsylvania Republican whose opposition in the Judiciary Committee to Judge Borks nomination was a key factor in the Bork defeat But I feel very badly personally for Judge Ginsburg and his family on what has been a very difficult situation for them in the past few days Bennett Role Assailed Paul Weyrich president of the Coalition for America an umbrella organization for conservative lobbying groups criticized the White House for allowing Education Secretary William J Bennett to ask Judge Ginsburg on Friday to withdraw his name He complained that Mr Bennetts call to Judge Ginsburg was a less than honest and desirable way to proceed when the President was still publicly saying he supported Judge Ginsburg Mr Bennetts spokesman said the secretary made the call after calling Mr Reagan and getting his consent but White House officials today declined to characterize the Presidents half of that conversation The White House has no spine Mr Weyrich said The President should either have told Bennett No I still support Ginsburg or Yes I agree with you and Ill have Howard Baker get on the phone to Ginsburg immediately The White House just doesnt know how to treat people Mr Weyrich said he believed Judge Kennedy had the inside track on the nomination and that he could be a viable nominee despite concerns by conservative lawmakers We have to be practical he said He is within the range of conservatism we support It is critical that we get a nominee through this year or were going to be in a situation where we have no nominee Conservatives have sought a nominee who has a strong stand against abortion opposes what Mr Reagan terms judicial activism and supporters stronger lawenforcement measures
THE CONTRADICTIONS OF BOB DOLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/magazine/the-contradictions-of-bob-dole.html,BOB DOLE WAS adamant The budget deficit he had said since the beginning of the Reagan Presidency was the nations No 1 priority Now standing on the floor of the United States Senate the tall crisply tailored Kansan was elaborating on that theme Health programs he said were just another instance of how Congress puts spending on automatic pilot But later in the privacy of a HouseSenate conference he took quite a different tack In a whispered conversation in an ornate room in the Longworth House Office Building Senator Dole advised Representative Henry Waxman the liberal Democratic chairman of a key House subcommittee to ignore his pronouncements on austerity and press for expansion of Medicaids prenatalcare program The proposal became law  with Bob Doles silent support It was a virtuoso performance that left few traces a tactic at which the 64yearold Mr Dole excels He is a nocturnal legislator introducing bills without hearings or debate on behalf of interests public and private He is a master of compromise a necessary talent for a Senate leader But there remains a question that has troubled political observers for years and may be a central issue in Mr Doles campaign for the 1988 Republican nomination for President which he is scheduled to announce formally tomorrow What does Bob Dole stand for Bob waits to see which way the wind is blowing says Nancy Landon Kassebaum the junior Republican Senator from Kansas Theres always a question Does he have a vision You wont see him creating an agenda In a year in which the character of potential Presidents has become a dominant issue Bob Dole is a man of selfcontained contrasts and conflicts He has a meanness of spirit but a capacity for compassion He is a strident Republican partisan who woos Democrats and independent voters He is an expert at building political coalitions yet is a loner with few close friends An examination of Senator Doles life and record reveals a host of contradictions Acknowledged by his peers as a consummate governmental insider Mr Dole is basing his 1988 candidacy on the affirmation that he will be the handson President that most Americans are looking for Yet he professes a lack of involvement in a series of bitter controversial campaign episodes dating from the start of his political career Although he is campaigning for President as a fiscal conservative and calling the budget deficit the single biggest black cloud over this country Mr Dole was the architect of the 1985 agricultural bill that accounted for 12 percent of last years total budget deficit The Senator has also decried the influence of the special interests in politics A guy walking out on the scaffolding should have the same rights as some bigcity banker he says But he has promoted legislation that benefited key fundraisers and friends More significantly the Doles received preferential treatment in the acquisition of Florida property from Dwayne O Andreas the chairman of a large agribusiness company that has been a major beneficiary of the Senators legislative efforts Sitting in his office just off the Senate floor portraits of previous Republican leaders on the walls and a stunning view of the Washington Monument outside his window Mr Dole shrugs off the apparent contradictions I may not be totally predictable he says in the flat nasal tones of his native Kansas Im not certain thats all bad The unpredictability is part of a driving ambition that now sees him in his third campaign for national office That ambition  the strongest constant in Bob Doles life  was forged during a difficult Depressionera childhood on the Middle Western plains and by a World War II injury that kept him hospitalized for three years and left him permanently without the use of his right arm Although most observers agree that he has mellowed considerably since his 1975 marriage to Elizabeth Hanford who recently resigned as Secretary of Transportation in the Reagan Cabinet to campaign for her husband that injury has left him with an enduring edge of bitterness The White House would be the culmination of a quest for power that contrasts with the powerlessness of his povertyridden early years and the helplessness that followed the war wound Whether you really made a difference whether you really did anything while you were here says Mr Dole explaining his drive with the halfsentences and secondperson references that mark his style All Bob Dole wants he adds is to be a success story RUSSELL Kan could be the setting for a Sinclair Lewis novel Union Pacific railroad tracks divide the town and a grain elevator dominates the skyline Main Street six blocks long boasts a roller rink movie theater several shops and two drugstores The only hint of the towns claim to national prominence is a billboard at the intersection of Routes 70 and 281 that proclaims Welcome to Bob Dole Country It was in this tiny farming cattle and oil community 285 miles west of Kansas City that Robert Joseph Dole was born on July 22 1923 to Doran and Bina Dole They were stern parents From his mother Bobby Joe Dole recalls receiving a weekly spanking No good reason  just must be Saturday he says And his father who ran a cream station where farmers sold their dairy products and purchased bootleg liquor never asked you to do something twice says Kenneth Dole 63 the Senators younger brother who still lives in Russell During the Depression the Doles were engaged in a constant struggle against foreclosure Kenneth was afflicted with osteomyelitis a crippling bone infection that strained the family budget The brothers shared a twin bed their two sisters  Gloria now 65 and Norma Jean 62  slept in another twin bed in the same room One year to pay the bills the family rented out the first floor of their house and moved into the basement In high school Bob Dole earned membership in the National Honor Society and was captain of the basketball team played end on the football team and almost broke the track teams indoor record for the quarter mile His daily regimen began at 530 AM  when he performed household chores ran did pushups lifted weights and for 2 a week delivered the Salina Journal  and ended at 11 PM when Dawsons drugstore where he was a soda jerk closed shop With a personal loan of 300 from a local banker who told him to wear a hat because anybody without a hat is not moving up in the world Mr Dole went to the University of Kansas to study to become a doctor In 1943 he left school and enlisted in the Army Two years later the newly commissioned second lieutenant was assigned to the 85th regiment of the 10th Mountain Division an elite corps of skiers and mountain climbers that only recently had arrived in Italy Typical army the Senator recalls I was not a skier I am not a mountain climber I came from the plains of Kansas and wound up in the mountain division At 10 AM on April 14 1945 his regiment tried to take Hill 913 in the Apennine Mountains 40 miles south of Bologna Under a hail of flaming metal Bob Dole was struck whether by rifle machine gun mortar or artillery fire no one knew It was three weeks before the end of the war in Europe My radio guys name was Symms and he had been hit Mr Dole says I was trying to get him back into this little ravine and once I was backed in there I must have raised up and I felt this sting   I remember somebody came by and put my arms across my chest which was a relief because I didnt know where they were Bob Dole was awarded two Bronze Stars for his heroism in storming the mountain I dont know if I was ever brave he says You know there are some people who do things like fall on a grenade or stand in front of something to protect somebody I didnt have that kind of experience And thats bravery to me AT 21 THE body he had nurtured with predawn exercise was in tatters He was shipped from hospital to hospital to hospital along the way doctors removed an infected kidney And he began the long slow process of rehabilitation His right hand was useless he learned to write and to button his shirts with his left hand which itself was virtually devoid of feeling Mr Dole resented his enforced dependence and it was at this time that his temperament as a selfreliant loner began to emerge I went through a period of almost complete dependence Mr Dole says Even in the bathrooms they had to come in and help you You go through this period and you almost get stubborn the other way I dont want anybody to help me I can get it myself Dont touch me  Shortly before his discharge from a Veterans Administration hospital in Michigan Mr Dole met Phyllis Holden an occupational therapist from New Hampshire who worked with psychiatric patients He was not her patient indeed Mr Dole says he has never received psychological counseling She had worked with so many disabled men that she didnt consider him handicapped They fell in love and were married three months later After attending the University of Arizona for a year on the GI Bill Mr Dole transferred to Washburn University in Topeka Kan The VA provided him with a primitive wire recorder to take down lectures a memento he still keeps in his apartment in Washingtons Watergate complex He spent his evenings painstakingly transcribing the lectures I learned early on that you didnt help him unless he asked Phyllis recalled recently In 1952 he was awarded both his bachelors degree and his law degree magna cum laude While he was still in law school several area politicians persuaded him to run for the State Legislature His parents were New Deal Democrats but the local Republican leader told him that there were twice as many Republicans as Democrats in Russell County I made an onthespot philosophical judgment that Id always wanted to be a Republican the Senator quips He ran as a war hero and won serving a term in the Legislature during his final year in college After his graduation he returned to Russell with his law degree and political experience and won the post of Russell County Attorney For a young politician Mr Dole was surprisingly uneasy with people  a trait that marks him to this day Russ Townsley the editor of the Russell Daily News recalls evenings spent with the Doles The two wives would chat in the kitchen while the two men read their newspapers in the living room There wasnt a lot of idle chatter Mr Townsley says Although Mr Dole capitalized on his war experience in his first political campaign he rarely spoke of his early struggles during his subsequent career as a national politician Instead he consistently projected an unemotional pragmatic mien Now however in an obvious effort to humanize his remote character he speaks of the hardships of his youth My grandparents were tenant farmers he told an audience in St Cloud Minn in late September Some made it and some didnt And they didnt As County Attorney I had to approve welfare checks and two of those went to my grandparents The memory lingers finding expression in his desire to help people whom conservatives often have ignored There are groups in this country who have to turn to the Government for help he told an Elks Club dinner in Shenandoah Iowa last spring They may be very poor people They may be disabled They may be senior citizens They may be dependent children We do have a responsibility when nobody else is going to do it But such sentiments representing what some observers have labeled the new Dole did not always characterize his ideology During his eight years in the House of Representatives Mr Dole opposed most of the underpinnings of President Kennedys New Frontier and President Johnsons Great Society A typical rural legislator he voted against the first of the big antipoverty programs in 1964 against aid to impoverished Appalachia against subsidies for urban masstransportation projects and against Medicare Mr Dole jettisoned some of his conservative views in 1974 but only when he faced a difficult Senate reelection contest He opposed the Nixon Administrations proposal to slash funds for the antipoverty program he had voted against 10 years earlier He cosponsored with Democratic Senator George McGovern  a man he had previously attacked as a partnerinmudslinging against President Nixon  proposals to strengthen the foodstamp program and to establish new programs for school breakfasts and nutrition supplements for infants and pregnant women Some of these programs benefited his farm constituents as well When he began to eye national office Mr Dole sought more avidly to broaden his base In the 1980s for example he created a nonprofit foundation to channel money to projects for the disabled And he played a significant role in civilrights legislation sponsoring the bill that made Martin Luther King Jrs birthday a national holiday and strongly supporting an extension of the Voting Rights Act Said Joseph L Rauh Jr a Washington lawyer and leading civil rights advocate We wouldnt have gotten the Voting Rights extension if not for Bob Dole BUT IF MR DOLES EARLY experiences with poverty and his wounding in the war bred a deeply felt compassion they also engendered a bitterness that has plagued his political career It first surfaced during his initial campaign for Congress in 1960 Mr Doles Republican primary race was marred by a whispering campaign alleging that his opponent Keith Sebelius had a drinking problem Mr Dole asked recently about the alcoholism charge which is vehemently denied by Mr Sebeliuss former associates said I dont know where it came from But those familiar with Mr Doles reluctance to delegate authority are convinced that he ran all aspects of that campaign and was responsible for the rumors prevalence Whatever the source the rumor gave Mr Dole the edge to gain a primary victory and he handily won the general election There was an undercurrent about drinking that worked well in the Bible Belt recalled Norbert Dreiling the former state Democratic chairman Mr Sebelius eventually succeeded Mr Dole in the House But the whispering campaign engendered a lifelong enmity between the Sebelius family and Mr Dole who was pointedly not invited back to the home after attending Mr Sebeliuss 1982 funeral After four terms in the House Mr Dole succeeded a retiring Kansas Republican in the United States Senate There and as Republican national chairman he attracted national attention for vigorously defending President Nixons Vietnam policies and his handling of Watergate His strident support for President Nixon became a major issue in his bitter Senate reelection campaign in 1974 against Democratic Representative William R Roy a Topeka obstetrician gynecologist and lawyer Just two weeks before Election Day polls indicated that Dr Roy was leading The Dole forces counterattacked with a campaign to brand Dr Roy an abortionist The doctor had indeed performed several abortions but only to save the lives of the mothers and only with the approval of the administration of the Roman Catholic hospital with which he was affiliated I got picketed every place I went Dr Roy recalled The last Sunday they leafleted the parking lots of Roman Catholic churches with photos of fetuses in garbage cans Senator Dole  who supports overturning the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision and prefers that the states set their own laws regarding abortion  now recalls the picketing as the work of some campaign enthusiasts But here again the evidence suggests that he was personally involved Dr Roy for example vividly remembers that Mr Dole spoke at several Catholic high schools during the campaigns last week and the last thing he said was When you go home ask your mother if she knows how many abortions Dr Roy has performed  The Senator was narrowly reelected Mr Doles 1976 VicePresidential campaign with President Gerald R Ford was similarly marked by its strident tactics The best remembered moment of that race is probably Mr Doles televised debate with Walter F Mondale the Democratic nominee for Vice President Senator Dole called World Wars I and II the Korean and Vietnam conflicts Democrat wars He continued If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century it would be about 16 million Americans enough to fill the city of Detroit The reference to Democrat wars suggested by Ford strategists provoked a furor It burnished Mr Doles lingering image as a hatchet man and some suggested cost President Ford the close election to Jimmy Carter Erasing the stigma from 1976 was a major motivation behind Bob Doles first run for the Republican Presidential nomination But the 1980 campaign too proved an embarrassment and exacerbated his reputation as a man who lashes out when events turn against him The illfated campaign he withdrew in March after receiving only 607 votes out of 145000 cast in the New Hampshire primary spawned a lawsuit and accusations of campaign mismanagement and illegalities In March 1979 Mr Dole had hired a Washington political consultant Thomas D Bell Jr to manage his race By the summer the campaign was short of money Mr Dole was still low in the polls and Mr Bell was in the process of leaving On the eve of his departure Mr Dole praised him at a staff meeting but then as Mr Bell was exiting the Senator unexpectedly handed him a letter alleging unauthorized expenditures mismanagement and illegal campaign practices The accusations later reappeared in the lawsuit Senator Doles campaign committee filed against Mr Bell and his company Mr Dole claims a dim memory of the dispute It probably may have happened he said recently when asked about the meeting and the letter I think there were a lot of unauthorized expenditures But several former campaign staff members who requested anonymity said that Mr Dole had knowledge of or orally approved virtually every significant expenditure or activity in the brief 1980 race The aides added that Mr Dole filed the lawsuit because legally he wanted to postpone having to pay the campaign debts and psychologically he had to find a victim The lawsuit is part of his dark side recalled one former aide Doles inclination is to find a victim or scapegoat In April 1980 just before Senator Dole was scheduled to testify in the case his campaign committee dropped its lawsuit against Mr Bell PARADOXICALLY Bob Dole has a knack for turning his victims into admirers Bill Roy his Democratic Senate opponent in 1974 now believes Mr Dole is doing a good job And although the Senator left his first wife in 1972  walking into their Washington home one evening after 23 years of marriage and one daughter and announcing simply I want out  his former wife currently makes and sells Dole for President buttons back home in Topeka Some people think its weird says Phyllis Macey who subsequently married a wealthy Kansas rancher and after his death wed a retired school administrator I make a little money off them and hed make a good President Bob Dole has softened Old age he quips But friends and colleagues trace it to another source  his 1975 marriage to Elizabeth Hanford an ambitious politically savvy lawyer 13 years his junior They met shortly after Mr Doles divorce She was a consumer affairs specialist in the Nixon White House She went to see the Republican national chairman to discuss a consumer plank in the 1972 Republican platform I knew his name but didnt know what he looked like Mrs Dole recalled recently Well the door opened and he came in   I just looked up and thought Goodness hes an attractive man  He called her a few days later and we had so much in common we talked for 40 minutes about government politics mutual friends Three years later the woman who had been told by friends Elizabeth youre not going to find anyone strong enough for you married the Senator Elizabeth Hanfords childhood could not have been more different from Bob Doles Her family was part of the gentry in Salisbury NC where her father owned the largest wholesale floral supply company in the Southeast Today her net worth is between 1 million and 3 million according to Congressional financial reports required of legislators and their spouses Senator Doles personal net worth is between 196000 and 510000 She had always been a perfectionist Her mother Mary Hanford recalled the day that Liddy received the letter informing her that she was accepted at Duke University but would not get a scholarship Her pride wounded she cried at the table went up to her room returned to the table and wept some more Finally her brother John told her Liddy Dads the one who should be crying Hes going to have to pay the bills Like her husband Elizabeth Dole has changed her politics She came to Washington in 1966 as a Great Society Democrat to work at the Department of Health Education and Welfare She did not register as a Republican until 1975 two years after her appointment by President Nixon to the Federal Trade Commission After their marriage Bob and Elizabeth Dole quickly became celebrated as the capitals power couple They have attempted to exert firm control over their growing reputation In late 1985 when Cosmopolitan magazine was preparing to publish an article on them the Doles demanded to see the manuscript They strenuously objected to suggestions that rumors are all over the Hill that the marriage is shaky I have never ever had so much concern on the part of an interviewed person says Helen Gurley Brown the magazines editor They were just crazed with anxiety The Doles claimed the article was filled with inaccuracies We have a wonderful warm relationship that we have been able to enjoy over the years Mrs Dole affirms The Doles subsequently were allowed to delete the offending passages from the manuscript The Cosmopolitan episode shows the extent to which the Doles mirror each other Both desire complete control over their work and both are protective of their collective image recognizing its importance to the political ambitions they share THOSE AMBITIONS recently have seen Bob Dole again follow his historical pattern of shifting his positions to woo important constituencies Having moved to the center on social issues in the 1970s Mr Dole as the Senate majority leader in 198586 skipped back to the right unabashedly courting his partys conservatives a critical Republican primary voting bloc by championing their agenda on abortion school prayer and gun control on the Senate floor Mr Doles attempts to win the right fly in the face of campaign speeches designed to broaden his appeal to moderate Democrats and independents Moreover they also have hurt fellow Republicans according to some of his colleagues Senator Dole engineered the Senate vote to eliminate Social Security costofliving increases for 1986 a position that even the Reagan Administration ultimately rejected as politically untenable during an election year The attempt forced Republican Senators to cast unpopular votes in the conservative effort to cut the deficit and kept the Senate in session until October preventing vulnerable incumbents from campaigning He subverted the majority leadership to his own Presidential ambitions asserts Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr a Connecticut Republican He wanted conservative support in his quest for the Presidency Senator Dole dismisses the charge calling Senator Weicker a maverick Mr Doles Presidential candidacy may have led him into other contradictions In raising approximately 15 million for various campaigns during the last decade the Senator maintains that he has assiduously avoided close connections between campaign contributors and legislation I set my own little rule and tried to avoid appearance of a conflict he explained recently I didnt want anybody brought into this office  to say Well raise money if you do this  But on occasion Mr Dole appears to have strayed from this standard Several top business executives whose industries have benefited from the Senators legislative efforts have raised funds for various Dole campaigns and currently serve on his Presidential finance committee One of the Senators campaign fundraisers for example is David W Broome In 1985 Mr Dole held discussions on a textilequota bill with Mr Broome then a lobbyist for Burlington Industries the large textile manufacturer  after Mr Broome had raised 600000 for the Senators political action committee Mr Dole supported the bill in sharp contrast to other farmstate Senators who feared retaliatory quotas if it passed This industry was under particular strain and needed help Mr Dole said recently in a prepared statement explaining his support for the legislation Another of Senator Doles longtime fundraisers is William J Clark the chairman of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company In 1986 Mr Clark discussed with Senator Dole provisions of the taxreform bill then pending in Congress Subsequently in a private Saturday session of the Finance Committee the Senator introduced a controversial amendment to the 1986 tax act to stop the Internal Revenue Service from questioning certain reinsurance agreements used by Mass Mutual and some other companies In the early months of his Presidential campaign the single largest source of contributions  more than 30000  was Mass Mutual executives A more serious conflict may be Senator Doles relationship with Dwayne Andreas Mr Andreas is the chairman of ArcherDanielsMidland the 474 billion commodities company based in Decatur Ill that is the leading American producer of ethanol a corn byproduct used to make alcohol fuels Senator Dole has long been regarded as ethanols leading advocate in Congress his efforts included successful opposition to a 1982 proposal by President Reagan to eliminate a Federal subsidy for the fuel At about the same time in 1982 the Doles acquired an apartment in the Sea View Hotel a 40yearold oceanfront resort in Bal Harbour Fla The hotel is structured like a cooperative with residents holding shares in the corporation rather than the titles to individual units The shareholders include such members of Washingtons political elite as the White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr and Thomas P Tip ONeill Jr the former Speaker of the House The Sea Views chairman secretary treasurer and major stockholder is Dwayne Andreas With his help the Doles purchased their apartment The Doles relationship with Mr Andreas raises questions not only because of the Senators legislative efforts on his behalf but because Mr Andreass past financial dealings with political figures in both parties have been controversial In 1973 for example the Watergate special prosecutor charged him with making an illegal corporate contribution to Hubert Humphreys 1968 Presidential campaign Mr Andreas argued that the funds were a loan to the Humphrey campaign from a corporation he headed He was acquitted after a trial before a judge Mr Dole initiated the purchase of the Sea View apartment according to Robert Strauss the former Democratic national chairman who sits on ArcherDanielsMidlands board and also owns a Sea View unit Several months after the Senator inquired about the availability of an apartment the Doles acquired 75 shares  34 percent of the total number that had belonged to Mr Andreas The price for the threeroom unit totaled 150000 There appears to be little doubt that the Doles received preferential treatment from Mr Andreas if only in having access to the shares Dwayne Andreas seems to have complete control of everything that goes on here said James G Brock a member of the Sea Views board of directors who added that he had friends who would have bid on the property had they known it was available The sale said another former Sea View official who handled the transaction was basically consummated as a personal thing by Mr Andreas The actual ownership of the Doles shares is clouded by conflicting records The current stockholders list and the minutes for the Sea Views 1982 board meeting state that the Senator and Mrs Dole are the owners However the original deed between the hotel and the Doles dated March 19 1982 lists only Mrs Dole as the owner And a subsequent deed also dated March 19 1982 but actually executed several months later lists Mrs Dole and her brother John Hanford as the owners according to Mari Maseng the Dole campaigns communications director Mrs Dole said she and her brother bought the apartment dividing the cost equally because they both wanted a place we could use as a little family retreat Mother is getting up in years The value of the Doles unit is also in dispute Mrs Dole said the 50000perroom price they paid was fairmarket value because the market is what other people pay However an equivalent threeroom unit in a less desirable location in the building was sold for 190000 three months before the Doles purchased their apartment according to Sea View officials That price conforms to the actual market value of the Doles unit according to an independent estimate prepared for The New York Times by Lawrence R Sherry managing partner of the Miami office of Kenneth Leventhal  Company a leading accounting firm specializing in real estate In an interview Senator Dole consistently expressed no knowledge of the details of the Sea View transaction Its not my property so I dont run around keeping numbers on it he said Check with Elizabeth  she bought it He denied helping Mr Andreas or ArcherDanielsMidland on legislation and noted that his efforts on ethanol have aided a significant part of his farm constituency There is a lot of interest in ethanol it didnt all come from ADM he said BOB DOLE EXPLAINS his politics simply Im fairly consistently conservative on the economic side foreignpolicy side defense side he says But his complexity is evident in his 1988 Presidential campaign a candidacy that is part Kansas roots and part Washington expertise part populism and part pragmatism part conservatism and part moderation Im here today because I know where Im from he told cheering Minnesotans at the states Republican convention in September But where he is from if history is any indication is no guide to where he will be He was a bitter mean son of a bitch I wondered what was burning so deeply inside his gut says Dr Bill Roy the Senators 1974

Haste and Ideological Fights Set Nomination on Course Ending in Its Doom,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/us/haste-and-ideological-fights-set-nomination-on-course-ending-in-its-doom.html,The complete account of how and why President Reagan surprised many in the Senate and the Administration nine days ago by choosing for the Supreme Court a littleknown 41yearold judge championed by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d is not yet known But many close to the process say the selection of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg was driven more by ideology and time pressure than by careful scrutiny of the nominees personal background and professional qualifications His nomination on Oct 29 came after Mr Reagan had pledged to find someone liberals would dislike just as much as Judge Robert H Bork the Presidents unsuccessful first nominee But the choice was made before the Federal Bureau of Investigation had done its investigation of Judge Ginsburgs background And it came amid feuding between Administration factions while personal and international events were distracting the President and others Judge Ginsburg a former Harvard law professor and Administration official who had argued in court only once in his life and had become a Federal appellate judge less than a year ago withdrew today after a cascade of disclosures about his background including his past marijuana use The disclosures by the press have raised new questions about the haste ideological conflict and apparent sloppiness that marked the Administrations behindthescenes nomination process The disclosures may also have weakened the hand of Mr Meese in choosing the next nominee and strengthened that of the White House Chief of Staff Howard H Baker Jr the leader of the politically pragmatic faction of Presidential advisers He had told Mr Reagan a few hours before Judge Ginsburg was nominated that his relative inexperience might be a problem and that the other finalist Judge Anthony M Kennedy an experienced respected Federal appellate judge from Sacramento Calif could more easily be confirmed Perception of Views Based on Scant Evidence While a senior Administration official said today that Judge Kennedy was the leading candidate to be the next nominee he had also been thought of as the likely choice on Oct 29 just hours before Mr Reagan named Judge Ginsburg But some conservatives in the Administration and Senate including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina campaigned vigorously in those last few hours against Judge Kennedy on the ground that he was an insufficiently fervent conservative and Mr Reagan might be reluctant to pick someone they oppose So hasty was the choice of Judge Ginsburg and so swift his fall that Mr Reagan who demanded on Oct 29 that Senate hearings start within three weeks never got around to sending the formal nomination to the Senate Nor even today has the FBI completed its investigation of the judge Senator Helms and some other conservatives who pushed for Judge Ginsburg seemed to be moved largely by opposition to Judge Kennedy whom they suspected might adhere to Supreme Court precedents upholding abortion rights among other things But Mr Meese and others perceived Judge Ginsburg as an ideological soul mate who shared their disdain for liberal Supreme Court precedents This perception was apparently based less on the public record which is barren of statements by Judge Ginsburg on most major constitutional issues including abortion than on private conversations he had with Mr Meese who was his boss at the Justice Department from 1985 to 1986 and others Identity of Supporters Disturbing to Liberals Before the judge withdrew today several Senators had planned to inquire closely into what if any assurances he gave to Mr Meese to his former colleagues at the Justice Department or to others about his views on abortion rights and other key issues Judge Ginsburg was interviewed the night before his nomination in Mr Meeses office by the Attorney General and other officials including Mr Baker and Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds a fervent conservative who also supported him over Judge Kennedy The same officials also interviewed Judge Kennedy that night Some liberals said they assumed that Judge Ginsburg was a Meese movement conservative or a Borklet as one put it largely because of the identities of his supporters and suspicions that they must have reason to believe he would pursue Mr Meeses crusade to overrule the abortion decision and other Court decisions on a range of social issues Some doubt has been cast on this perception by close friends and former colleagues of Judge Ginsburg who said that his views on some social issues were unknown and perhaps more liberal that the Administrations and by indications that his style of life is not typical of a social conservative One friend of Judge Ginsburgs said he does not share some of the pieties and moralisms of this Administration The nominees constitutional philosophy on such matters as civil rights and civil liberties if he has one remains a mystery although he has been a vigorous and public proponent of the Administrations free market probusiness approach to economic and regulatory issues Meanwhile it was neither the FBI nor the Administration but rather National Public Radio and The Washington Post that first learned the nominee had smoked marijuana in front of other professors and perhaps students while he was teaching at Harvard Law School as recently as 1979 Judge Ginsburg himself when asked in Mr Meeses office and in subsequent meetings with Senate Republicans whether there might be anything embarrassing in his background made no mention of his prior marijuana use One Justice Department official said today the Administration could not fairly be faulted for failing to discover Judge Ginsburgs past marijuana use Here was a colleague a man we know he said He had been through as many as four FBI background checks in connection with previous appointments and the issue of the drug use had never arisen there and had never arisen in two previous confirmation hearings It was something we didnt know from personal work and experience I think anyone in our shoes would have had such a problem as this one that did arise The nomination process was driven by pressure to name someone quickly with the clock ticking down on the second Reagan term and the prospect of increasing difficulty in getting any nominee confirmed as the 1988 election year approached It unfolded amid feuding between pragmatic and ideological factions of the Administration and a frenetic cascade of events that distracted the three key players Mr Reagan Mr Meese and Mr Baker While Judge Borks nomination was dying in the Senate Mr Reagan was distracted by his wifes cancer surgery the stock market plunge the sincereversed Soviet ban on a summit meeting and his motherinlaws death in Arizona Fight Over Kennedy Sets Views on Ginsburg Meanwhile Mr Meese had to deal with the death and funeral of his infant grandson and to testify before a grand jury in Washington that is investigating whether he has acted improperly in office All these global events and personal tragedies came in the 12 days before Mr Reagan chose Judge Ginsburg after a process of elimination that ruled out more than 20 candidates who had been considered at one time or another Some of these prospects many of them far more prominent than Judge Ginsburg were eliminated over concerns that they were not conservative enough for the President too visibly conservative for the Senate not sufficiently intelligent lacking in judicial temperament too fat to have a long life expectancy opposed by antiabortion groups or championed by Democrats who had angered the Administration by opposing Judge Bork Judge Ginsburgs nomination came only a few days after he had first been thrust into serious contention apparently by key Administration conservatives with whom he served while in three Administration jobs from 1983 to 1986 It came only a few hours after Senators including Mr Helms and Joseph R Biden Jr the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee had been told by officials that the likely nominee was Judge Kennedy Another sign of haste in the selection process was that White House lawyers who were questioned by a New York Times reporter after the nomination could cite almost no specifics in Judge Ginsburgs record to support Mr Reagans description of him as a proponent of judicial restraint who profoundly believes in the rule of law and would be tough on crime Nor could the White House supply citations of the 13 decisions he had written in his less than one year as a judge Judge Kennedys hopes disappeared amid if not because of a lastminute flurry of opposition from Senate conservatives including Mr Helms and Orrin G Hatch of Utah who told a reporter the day before the nomination that Judge Kennedy was not solid enough for some conservatives on abortion and other issues important to them He called Mr Meese later that day These Senators joined Administration conservatives close to Mr Meese in criticizing Judge Kennedy at a time when all other contenders except Judge Ginsburg had been eliminated Mr Helms told a Times reporter that he had helped mobilize conservatives against Judge Kennedy after being told by an authoritative Administration official at 1130 PM the night before the nomination that he would be probably be chosen unless conservatives weighed in fast and furious against him Conservatives had two main complaints about Judge Kennedy according to Senate aides Administration officials and others They had doubts about how completely he was committed to their judicial philosophy especially because they considered his rather ambiguous language in a 1980 decision unduly tolerant of the Supreme Courts decisions protecting abortion and sexual privacy And they were suspicious of the fact that Mr Biden had told Mr Baker that Judge Kennedy might be acceptable subject to further investigation of his record This was a game where the parties became more symbolic than they could possibly be real said one supporter of Judge Ginsburg The Jesse Helmses were saying Joe Biden shouldnt dictate the Presidents choice and the Democrats were saying If Helms and Meese are for Ginsburg then there must be something wrong with him The assumption on which both sides were working was that the friend of my enemy is my enemy In the end Kennedy was Bidens choice this Ginsburg supporter said That created its own conservative counterthrust It is unclear exactly what took place at the White House the morning of the announcement that Judge Ginsburg would be the nominee The official account is that President Reagan chose Judge Ginsburg at a meeting with Mr Meese and Mr Baker that ended about 945 AM Conservative Joy Fades Amid the Disclosu But Senator Biden said he was told about 1030 AM that the likely nominee was Judge Kennedy by a Justice Department official who may or may not have had uptotheminute information The announcement of Judge Ginsburgs nomination in a White House ceremony prompted brief celebration among some conservatives who congratulated Mr Meese on his victory But most Republican senators including Bob Dole of Kansas the minority leader were noncommittal from the start about the nominee whose inexperience concerned them and whose views were largely unknown to them Liberal senators and others who opposed Judge Bork also remained noncommittal saying close study of the nominee and the selection process was needed Conservative lobbyists reported difficulty in stirring up passionate support on the right for the bearded dapper former Harvard law professor who had nothing resembling the personal following Judge Bork had enjoyed That difficulty deepened in a rush of disclosures about the nominees personal background and lifestyle controversy about his professional work and other developments At the outset some said they were puzzled by such details as the fact that Judge Ginsburgs 17yearold and 2yearold daughters did not take his last name the 2yearold being named Hallee K Morgan after his current wife A Ginsburg supporter recalled incredulously that he took a phone call from a selfdescribed Bork supporter who said this made Judge Ginsburg seem like a wimp Meanwhile antiabortion activists who had quickly applauded the nomination began to worry about whether Judge Ginsburg was on their side after it was disclosed that his wife an obstetrician had once performed abortions There was also a report by his first wife which Judge Ginsburg later denied and she retracted that he had once advised a rape victim to have such a procedure Liberals kept their powder dry while reporters began digging into every aspect of Judge Ginsburgs life ranging from his departure from Cornell University to help manage a computer dating service to his judicial opinions A succession of damaging disclosures followed beginning with reports that he had worked on matters of interest to the cable television industry while holding 140000 worth of stock in a cable television company The Administration denied any impropriety saying the nature of his involvement could not have affected his financial interests but the steady corrosion of allegation denial and calls for further investigation had begun There was a daily barrage of cutting publicity more details on cable television matters reports that Judge Ginsburg had exaggerated his courtroom experience anonymous jibes at him by some liberal former colleagues on the Harvard law faculty and more The nomination was finally doomed when news organizations learned from anonymous sources that Judge Ginsburg had smoked marijuana at one or more parties while on the Harvard law faculty prompting the nominee to admit to prior marijuana use in an announcement Thursday evening Some Administration officials and Republican Senators who had been assured by Judge Ginsburg that there were no embarrassments in his background could barely conceal their sense of betrayal In the end the nomination sunk under the weight of disapproval from conservatives who could not tolerate his prior marijuana use which some liberals including Senator Biden deemed irrelevant As the news of the marijuana story circulated late Thursday one liberal Senate aide said Im beginning to like this guy But despite supportive statements by Mr Reagan and Mr Meese it was only a matter of time before Secretary of Education William J Bennett with Mr Reagans consent and Republican Senators persuaded Judge Ginsburg the time had come to withdraw
Feminism vs. Civil Liberties,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/opinion/feminism-vs-civil-liberties.html,Karen Straw killed her husband but in September a Queens jury acquitted her of murder after hearing defense evidence that she was a battered wife Soon a Manhattan jury is to begin to hear testimony in the trial of Robert Chambers for the murder of Jennifer Levin in Central Park Mr Chambers claims Ms Levins death was the accidental result of rough sex What do Karen Straw and Robert Chambers have in common Plenty Mr Chambers will try to prove his story by introducing evidence that Ms Levin was sexually aggressive with other men Feminists who rightly hailed the Straw acquittal condemn such evidence as a tactic intended to focus the trial on the victims supposed promiscuity instead of on the defendants conduct They would permit Karen Straw but not Robert Chambers to pin blame on someone else The Chambers case contains one of several recent issues on which civil libertarians and feminists have taken opposite sides Although American feminism began as a traditional civil liberties quest for constitutional and legislative equality it occasionally promotes goals at odds with entrenched civil liberties values and constitutional claims of other protected groups For example an abortion clinic opens Opponents picket it No one is physically prevented from entering the clinic but the picketers hold up pictures of fetuses and shout provocative statements as patients arrive Does a womans right to reproductive freedom mean the police can remove the picketers Or do antiabortion groups have a right to discourage those who want to enter the clinic Or consider a magazine that prints sexually explicit pictures of women The pictures are offensive but not obscene according to the Supreme Courts definition of obscenity Do opponents have a right to stop the magazine on the ground that the pictures degrade women as a group Or does the magazine have a right to continue to publish regardless of whom it offends These are actual cases in which civil libertarians have defended the picketers and the magazine Many feminists opposed both Splits in the civil liberties world have occurred before Some supporters of the black civil rights movement grew disenchanted by its demands for affirmative action which they considered reverse discrimination And even ardent defenders of the First Amendment have balked at its use to protect the speech of Nazis Communists and the Palestine Liberation Organization But the emerging conflict between feminist goals and civil liberties principles is different Both feminism and civil liberties rest on elaborate theoretical foundations If these prove significantly incompatible the ensuing clash could well encompass numerous critical questions not merely the one or two discrete differences that have characterized past often temporary rifts In addition the feminist and civil liberties communities share substantially overlapping populations Their estrangement would weaken the political power and public positions of both and thwart the kind of cooperation that defeated Judge Robert H Borks Supreme Court nomination The first postulate of civil liberties is that they are indivisible They must protect everybody or they will protect nobody The antiabortion activists right to speak a magazines right to publish offensive photographs and a defendants right to tell his story at a trial cannot be compromised The indivisibility postulate has one exception When two civil liberties clash we must decide which will prevail So press freedom has been restricted to assure a fair trial and the prospect that affirmative action remedies will lead to greater equality has justified preferential treatment Feminists have also achieved victories by citing competing constitutional rights Laws forbidding certain private clubs from excluding women impinge on the associational rights of men Yet courts have upheld these laws because they further the competing value of gender equality No such competing constitutional values are present for those who want to penalize or suppress offensive magazines stop abortion clinic picketers or deny Mr Chambers the right to tell his story If we compromise constitutional claims in these cases we violate the indivisibility postulate That violation will eventually backfire If the picketers and the magazine can be silenced so can their critics And whats good enough for Robert Chambers will also be good enough for Karen Straw

A Dim View of Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/09/opinion/a-dim-view-of-justice.html,First Bork then Ginsburg Not since Richard Nixon responded to the Senates rejection of Supreme Court nominee Clement Haynsworth in 1969 by nominating the unqualified G Harrold Carswell has a President acted as if he held the American people in such utter contempt Surely in the wake of the bruising Bork battle it was incumbent upon President Reagan to offer a confirmable nominee of demonstrated judicial vision and high moral character Instead Mr Reagan made good on his promise to nominate someone they will dislike just as much Not content with filling Justice Powells vacated seat with a distinguished conservative Mr Reagan and his chief guru in these matters Attorney General Edwin Meese remained hellbent on finding someone inclined to take a dim view of such issues as civil rights and abortion as well as someone dubious about Constitutional protections of privacy No wonder theyve had such a disastrous time finding an unblemished jurist with such singular views is about as easy as locating a distinguished scientist who believes in Creationism It is a very small pool in which to fish In his rush to placate ideologues like Jesse Helms and to get back at the 58 Senators who voted against Mr Bork the President failed the rest of us He failed to perform a thoughtful search for a mainstream candidate of unimpeachable character and credentials Presented instead with a man of narrow views and limited judicial experience  one he was warned would be difficult to confirm  he rushed ahead with only a perfunctory background investigation Mr Ginsburgs potsmoking admission though only the proverbial last straw had the curious effect of bringing the American Civil Liberties Union and other liberals to his defense at the same time it gave Mr Helms et al an excuse to abandon a doomed nomination The one salutory development to come out of this episode may be the neutralizing of past pot smoking as a political liability through admissions by such straight arrows as Al Gore Bruce Babbitt and Claiborne Pell Mr Reagan is running out of time He may only get one more chance to redeem himself by leaving behind a Supreme Court in which all Americans can repose trust and confidence We deserve nothing less
REAGAN WEIGHING CONFLICTING ADVICE ON COURT NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/09/us/reagan-weighing-conflicting-advice-on-court-nominee.html,Administration officials today weighed conflicting advice from senators and conservative strategists on how quickly to proceed in naming a new nominee for the Supreme Court Anthony M Kennedy a Federal appeals court judge from Sacramento Calif continues to be the frontrunner but conservative Republicans said there was some doubt in the White House about whether Judge Kennedy could win confirmation Several conservative leaders said they had been told by White House officials that President Reagans chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr had served notice that there would have to be a very good reason at this point not to submit Judge Kennedys name to the Senate Criticism of White House Conservative as well as moderate Republicans have criticized the White House for sloppiness in investigating Judge Douglas H Ginsburg who on Saturday asked the White House to withdraw his nomination after his disclosure that he had smoked marijuana on several occasions in the 1960s and 1970s A lot of people are telling the Administration dont do it now wait two weeks show the President to be deliberative said an Administration strategist who is close to the selection process But leaders of some conservative groups have argued that the President must move quickly to show that he is in charge and to avoid entangling the nomination in election year politics if the process carries over into 1988 I dont think it would be wise to run this thing out another week or two said Bruce Fein a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation a conservative research organization here It seems very unlikely that they could pull anybody new out of the hat who would be so superior to the candidates on the existing list that it would justify a delay Judge Flies to Washington One indication that the Administration is moving quickly at least to narrow the list of potential nominees was the arrival here Saturday night by Air Force jet of Judge Kennedy who was a runnerup to Judge Ginsburg in the previous selection process Judge Kennedy who is 51 years old has been described as an independent in terms of ideology and is viewed as a candidate whose judicial record would be minimally acceptable to Senate conservatives as well as moderates Mr Baker has given those who oppose Mr Kennedy until Wednesday to come up with a viable rival said one conservative strategist who has been consulted by the White House However conservatives fear that because Judge Kennedy does not have strong support from either conservative Republicans or Democrats the Administration risks having a third Supreme Court nomination end in failure In addition conservatives believe that if the next nominee does not win confirmation Mr Reagan may lose the opportunity to fill the court vacancy before his term ends Kennedy is about as close to the choke point with conservatives as they can come said another Administration strategist close to the selection process Neither side knows very much about him but on a gut level the view is that he would be acceptable to the Democrats in the Senate said a Government official No Comment on Kennedy Neither the White House nor the Justice Department would confirm Judge Kennedys whereabouts or discuss whether any other potential nominees had been sent for But Clemmer Montague a spokesman for Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland confirmed that Judge Kennedy arrived there Saturday at 730 PM on a flight from McClellan Air Force Base in California Mr Reagan who spent the weekend at his Camp David retreat in Maryland returned to Washington this afternoon The White House declined to say whether he had met or planned to meet Judge Kennedy or any of the other people believed to be on the list of Supreme Court candidates The Administration according to several senators is working from the same list compiled when Judge Robert H Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court in July Judge Bork was defeated by the Senate last month after a bruising battle in which the Administration lost the support of several Republicans as well as Southern Democrats who had been counted on to provide the margin of victory in the Democraticcontrolled Senate James Buckley Suggested Paul Weyrich president of the Coalition for America an umbrella organization of conservative lobbying groups said that conservative lawmakers who are uncomfortable with Judge Kennedy asked the White House this weekend to consider former Senator James L Buckley of New York now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Mr Buckley 64 a staunch conservative had been passed over in earlier White House consideration of Supreme Court nominees because of his age But Mr Weyrich said the situation had changed after the furor over Judge Ginsburg Mr Buckley would be eminently confirmable because he is a former senator and senior officials in both the White House and the Justice Department are looking seriously at him Mr Weyrich said In addition those believed to be on the original White House list of 13 candidates include Cynthia Hall of Pasadena Calif also of the Ninth Circuit J Clifford Wallace of San Diego Ninth Circuit Laurence H Silberman of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Pasco M Bowman of Kansas City Mo of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Patrick E Higginbotham of Dallas of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Edith H Jones of Houston also of the Fifth Circuit Ralph K Winter Jr of New Haven of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Roger Miner of Albany also of the Second Circuit William W Wilkens Jr of Greenville SC of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Gerald B Tjoflat of Jacksonville Fla of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and Pamela Ann Rymer of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles Panel Has Some Information Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d told reporters Saturday night that he expected a nominee to be named within a week or so and that he hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would adhere to the schedule it had established for Judge Ginsburgs confirmation with hearings beginning Dec 7 But a senior staff member on the panel said he doubted that the schedule could be followed particularly if the nominee was controversial It is conceivable the committee could finish its work by the end of the year but it is unclear if a Senate floor vote could be done by then the aide said The Judiciary Committee began its own preliminary review of candidates on the Administrations list after the defeat of Judge Bork and as a result has already compiled some information on Judge Kennedy the aide said Similar preliminary information is also available to the committee on Judge Wilkens the candidate strongly favored by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee Mr Meese in his comments to reporters Saturday night said he would be happy with any of the candidates on the list a comment echoed today by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah Mr Hatch a member of the Judiciary Committee was reported at the time of Judge Ginsburgs selection to have warned the White House that he would oppose Judge Kennedy Hatch Sees Progress But in an appearance today on the CBS News program Face The Nation Mr Hatch said he had told the White House that while he preferred Judge Ginsburg he would have supported Judge Kennedy had he been the nominee They had 13 on the list Mr Hatch said Weve reduced it down to 9 Any of those 9 would be fine Pressed to name his favorite Mr Hatch said he would like Judge Edith Jones I would like to see another woman on the court he said I think it would be really great Judge Kennedy a Republican was appointed to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by President Ford in 1975 A native of Sacramento he is the only judge on the court to be based in the California capital where he has been teaching at the McGeorge School of Law of the University of the Pacific since 1965 Judge Kennedy has ties to both Mr Reagan and Mr Meese that go back to the Presidents days as Governor of California when Mr Kennedy was a lawyer and lobbyist in Sacramento and Mr Meese was executive secretary to the Governor Mr Kennedy was the principal author of Proposition 1 a taxcutting ballot initiative that did not pass while Mr Reagan was Governor but that eventually reemerged as the successful Proposition 13 under Gov Edmund G Brown Jr Mr Reagans successor Kennedy Hard to Categorize Judge Kennedy is described by friends and colleagues as a conservative and a proponent of the philosophy of judicial restraint but his legal writings nevertheless defy easy categorization He has never really written down his judicial philosophy in one place said Richard Willard the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division a close friend of Judge Kennedy who once served as the judges clerk Its like an Impressionist painting You really have to read all of his opinions to see any kind of pattern emerging Donald Ayers a Deputy Solicitor General who was United States Attorney in Sacramento said I think its fair to say hes a conservative fellow but hes most distinctly a judicious careful judge A Washington civil rights lawyer who worked on the campaign to prevent Judge Borks confirmation said Judge Kennedy seems far more openminded and moderate than other candidates whove been talked about In 1980 Judge Kennedy wrote a majority opinion upholding the Navys right to discharge homosexuals But he did so only on the legal question of due process not on whether homosexuality is protected by the Constitution Judge Kennedy wrote that the Navy banned homosexuality for military reasons not to coerce persons to comply with a moral precept He added Upholding the challenged regulations as constitutional is distinct from a statement that they are wise The latter judgment is neither implicit in our decision nor within our province to make Opinion on Womens Wages Judge Kennedy said there had been extensive arguments for and against the notion that sexual conduct among consenting adults was protected from government action He said the reasoning behind such Supreme Court decisions as the one that legalized abortion suggest that some kinds of government regulation of private consensual homosexual behavior may face substantial constitutional challenge In a case for which Judge Kennedy wrote the majority opinion a group of women challenged the State of Washingtons policy of setting wages according to the prevailing market rate in the public and private sectors A statecommissioned study showed that on average jobs filled mostly by women paid 20 percent less than jobs of comparable worth filled mostly by men In 1983 the state adopted a comparable worth policy for setting salaries but the women argued in their 1981 suit that the states previous employment policy was discriminatory Judge Kennedy disagreed He wrote that unless Washingtons State Legislature passed a specific law on the issue Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination in employment does not require the state to eliminate an economic inequality that it did not create He said there is nothing in the language of Title VII or its legislative history to indicate Congress intended to abrogate fundamental economic principles such as the laws of supply and demand or to prevent employers from competing in the labor market
10 Candidates Wrap Up Blitz Of Iowa Voters,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/09/us/10-candidates-wrap-up-blitz-of-iowa-voters.html,From Spencer to Grundy Center it was the busiest weekend yet for Presidential politics in Iowa as six Democrats and four Republicans converged on the state for a twoday burst of handshaking and speechmaking In Des Moines all the Democratic contenders came together Saturday night before 7700 of the party faithful at the annual JeffersonJackson Day dinner Supporters of Senator Paul Simon punctuated his speech by hurling from the balcony of the Veterans Memorial Auditorium tiny plastic parachutes to which were attached bow ties Mr Simons sartorial trademark And supporters of Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri hired a hot air balloon to soar over the auditorium In Waverly Vice President Bush flipped the coin before the annual gridiron contest between Wartburg College and Upper Iowa University While Mr Bush then set off to look for voters at a feed store in nearby Brandon Upper Iowa went to make history of its own by beating Wartburg 146 ending a schoolrecord 18game losing streak Pete du Pont a Delaware Republican started his Saturday at a coffee with supporters assembled at Christos Cafe in Grundy Center Only 2 Candidates Missing And two Democrats Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee and former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona spent a good chunk of time explaining their admissions Saturday that each had used marijuana when they were younger Of the 12 candidates who have declared themselves contenders for the Democratic or Republican Presidential nominations the only two who were not in the state over the weekend were two Republicans Alexander M Haig Jr and Pat Robertson Mr Haig canceled plans in the state to see his wife in Florida his campaign saying they had to talk over a personal family matter and Mr Robertson was campaigning in Arizona By midday today Mr Bush Mr du Pont and the two other Republican candidates  Jack F Kemp the upstate New York Congressman and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas  had all left Iowa Besides the four Republican candidates Barbara Bush the wife of the Vice President spent two days in the state She made nine stops including cutting the ribbon at the new National Farm Toy Museum in Dyersville and opening a new mammography unit at a medical center in Grinnel On Saturday Mr Dole and Mr Kemp appeared at a convention of abortion opponents in Des Moines then moved across town to join Mr du Pont at a candidates forum sponsored by the Homebuilders Association of Iowa The 12 campaigns have already spent an estimated 2 million here while the candidates have logged among them nearly 600 days of campaigning in the state The weekend campaigning among the Democrats culminated in this Des Moines suburb today when five of them gathered in a debate on the environment sponsored by the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club Mr Simon did not participate citing a scheduling conflict nor did any of the Republicans although they had been invited Gephardt Oil Plan Assailed Like a similar debate on the environment last week in New Hampshire there was broad agreement among the Democrats that they would all do more to protect the environment The sharpest disagreement involved Mr Gephardts proposal for an oil import fee which was roundly attacked by both Mr Babbitt and Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts Mr Gephardt said the fee would stabilize oil prices and promote exploration his opponents said it would wreak havoc with the world economy provide the oil companies with a financial windfall and lead to envrionmental abuse The Rev Jesse Jackson got one of the most enthusiastic responses from the audience when he said I have hired kids to pick up the signs of Governor Dukakis and Senator Gore on the way out to the debate Thats my way of helping to clean up the environment And Mr Babbitt proposed an incentive for states to agree to accept the site of a new highlevel dump for

"At Top of List, Judge Fitting Centrist Mold",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/us/at-top-of-list-judge-fitting-centrist-mold.html,Judge Anthony M Kennedy is a judicial conservative but one whose style more closely resembles that of Justice Lewis F Powell Jr the pragmatic centrist who retired from the Supreme Court in June than that of Judge Robert H Bork the thundering critic of liberal judicial activism whose nomination for the vacancy was defeated last month White House officials said today that Judge Kennedy 51 years old of Sacramento Calif was the leading candidate for the nomination in the wake of the withdrawal Saturday of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg Some Conservatives Opposed While it is impossible to tell how Judge Kennedy would affect the Courts ideological balance several experts who have studied some of his 500 judicial opinions in 12 years on the bench said he seems much less likely than did Judge Bork to change it dramatically Mainly for this reason some conservatives who passionately supported Judge Bork were working today to stop Judge Kennedy who is clearly no liberal from getting the nomination They have argued that this would be a capitulation in the longstanding effort by President Reagan to reverse the Courts direction Judge Kennedy has been a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit since President Ford appointed him in 1975 He has longstanding if not especially close ties to Mr Reagan for whom he drafted a taxcutting referendum proposal during Mr Reagans tenure as Governor of California Judge Kennedy also has strong support from some conservatives who are in and close to the Justice Department and who were once his law clerks Scholars who have studied Judge Kennedys opinions say they represent the work of a highly intelligent jurist with solid qualifications for the Supreme Court if not the kind of towering intellect with a clearly defined philosophy that many saw in Judge Borks work Judge Kennedys judicial opinions like those of Justice Powell generally seem to be narrowly crafted to decide the specific issue presented by a case and premised on scrupulously careful analysis of Supreme Court precedents and close attention to factual variations and competing interests Generally Tough on Crime Judge Kennedys votes in more than 100 criminal cases generally take a toughoncrime approach perhaps even tougher than those of Justice Powell in similar cases and make clear his reluctance to overturn convictions on technical grounds On the other hand he has voted against the police in some cases in which he considered their conduct unconstitutional and outrageous In one 1980 dissenting opinion he stressed the importance of the parentchild union in arguing that the police should not be allowed to use as evidence against a woman heroin that they found by bribing her 5yearold son with 5 Unlike Judge Bork who in his writings and speeches assailed dozens of Supreme Court precedents expanding individual rights as contrary to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution and thus illegitimate Judge Kennedy is not given to broad philosophical pronouncements or grand theories of constitutional interpretation Those who share the Administrations goal of overturning the Supreme Courts 1973 ruling recognizing a constitutional right to have an abortion also say they find hints in Judge Kennedys opinions that he may not share this goal On the other hand some liberal scholars who support abortion rights said they were concerned after reading the same Kennedy opinions that he might not be on their side either Kiss of Death Feared So intense is the ideological intrigue and warfare here in the wake of the Bork and Ginsburg defeats that some liberals who have been quite favorably impressed by preliminary study of Judge Kennedys opinions are reluctant to say so publicly for fear of giving him the kiss of death as one put it This experts concern was that the more fervent conservatives in and close to the Administration might reflexively oppose anyone who seems acceptable to moderates and liberals In any event while some liberal scholars see Judge Kennedy as the best nominee they are likely to get from Mr Reagan he is clearly no liberal Some of his decisions have been sharply criticized by feminists civil libertarians and others and liberal groups would clearly give him very careful scrutiny before deciding whether to oppose him in the event he is nominated Richard K Willard head of the Justice Departments Civil Division and a former law clerk to Judge Kennedy who has touted his qualifications for the Court inside the department said in an interview Sunday that Mr Kennedys approach was the essence of judicial restraint That is he has held that the role of judges was interpreting and applying the law rather than one of activism in which they try to take some kind of social philosophy and implement it in the courts Bruce Fein a conservative legal expert with the Heritage Foundation here said in an interview last month that Judge Kennedy is probably midway between Bork and Powell when it comes to voting and philosophy more a judicial technician than a judicial philosopher who has said nothing like Borks rapier attacks on the Supreme Courts reasoning I think he would be far more reluctant than Bob Bork to overrule a precedent said Mr Fein who believes many liberal precedents should be overruled He said his overall feeling about the prospect of a Kennedy nomination was one of phlegmatic enthusiasm Michael McDonald a lawyer with the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said today that Judge Kennedy would probably side with conservatives most of the time but that they couldnt count on him in the tough ones Its like the second coming of Warren Burger and thats nothing for conservatives to get excited about he added Among the complaints conservatives had about the retired Chief Justice Mr McDonald said was that he joined in Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that legalized abortion and was not a completely consistent opponent of affirmative action plans that favor racial minorities over whites Professor Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School perhaps the most prominent constitutional scholar to testify against Judge Bork at his confirmation hearings said today that after looking at 40 or 50 of Judge Kennedys opinions they seem respectful of precedent and sensitive to the full range of considerations at stake He added But I am not prepared to reach a final conclusion without further study on whether Judge Kennedy should be confirmed if nominated Mr Tribe noted that he had also spoken well of some of Judge Borks judicial opinions and that most of the criticism of Judge Bork from him and others was based on his extrajudicial writings and speeches in which Judge Bork freely denounced many Supreme Court precedents expanding civil rights and civil liberties Judge Kennedys specific views on affirmative action like his views on the constitutional issues raised by abortion are not widely known No articles by Judge Kennedy dealing with controversial issues have come to light and it is not known what he made have said in his speeches law school classes and other forums Of Judge Kennedys opinions the one that has been most discussed in connection with his possible nomination was a 1980 decision in Beller v Middendorf in which he upheld the constitutionality of Navy regulations providing for dismissal of enlisted persons who engage in homosexual acts Writing for a unanimous threejudge panel he ruled against three sailors who were dismissed for homosexual conduct despite otherwise good service records He cited the special need for discipline and order in the service the concern of the Navy that toleration of homosexual conduct might hurt recruiting and morale and other factors that he said outweighed any constitutional protection of such conduct But Judge Kennedy also said some things in his opinion that have become a focus of opposition to him by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina and some other conservatives who had applauded Judge Borks broad pronouncement in a similar Navy case that the Constitution does not protect private consensual homosexual conduct Unlike Judge Bork Judge Kennedy made a point of saying that upholding the challenged regulations as constitutional is distinct from a statement that they are wise and that the rule was a harsh one that the political branches of the Government were free to reconsider Also unlike Judge Bork he said that the reasoning of some Supreme Court precedents could arguably be deemed to suggest that some kinds of governmental regulation of private consensual homosexual behavior may face substantial constitutional challenge Again unlike Judge Bork he refrained from expressing any criticism of the decisions in which the Supreme Court protected some aspects of sexual privacy including the right to choose abortion Nor did he express approval of those decisions which as a lowercourt judge he was bound to apply whether he approved of them or not Legislative Veto Struck Down Among other key decisions written by Judge Kennedy are these  In a 1980 decision he struck down a provision in a law providing that either house of Congress could revoke certain decisions by the Attorney General in immigration cases ruling it a legislative encroachment on executive and judicial powers The Supreme Court upheld his ruling in a 1983 decision that broadly struck down the inclusion of such legislative veto provisions on dozens of Acts of Congress  In a 1983 dissent and other opinions Judge Kennedy argued for relaxing some of the technical rules that the Supreme Court has used to exclude illegally seized evidence and to allow use of evidence obtained by police officers who acted in the good faith belief that their actions were legal The Supreme Court has since adopted a somewhat similar approach  In the first Federal appellate decision on the subject Judge Kennedy wrote a decision overturning a lowercourt order that required the State of Washington to give male and female employees equal pay for jobs of comparable worth even if the jobs themselves were not similar While the plaintiffs argued that women have been channeled into jobs that are as important as higherpaying jobs held predominantly by men Judge Kennedy held that neither law nor logic deems the free market a suspect enterprise  In a 1979 concurring opinion Judge Kennedy said the Pasadena Calif Board of Education should be released from a school desegregation order because the effects of past official segregation had been remedied and that there was no constitutional obligation to maintain racial balance in schools once that had been done Aside from his judicial duties Judge Kennedy has taught constitutional law parttime at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento where he is said to be popular with students
Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Say They Will Rule On Teen-Ager Chastity Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-say-they-will-rule-on-teen-ager-chastity-law.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a law intended to encourage chastity among unmarried teenagers violates the Constitution by promoting religion The Court will decide whether Congress unlawfully promoted religion when it passed the Adolescent Family Life Act of 1981 The law allows religious organizations to be among groups receiving funds from the Department of Health and Human Services for promoting selfdiscipline as a form of birth control for teenagers Millions of dollars have been distributed under the laws provisions The law requires programs applying for funds to describe how in providing services they will involve religious and charitable organizations voluntary associations and other groups in the private sector The law was held unconstitutional last April 15 by a Federal district judge on a challenge brought by members of the clergy a group of taxpayers and the American Jewish Congress The judge Charles R Richey agreed with their argument that the law violates the constitutionally required separation of church and state Ruling Termed Deeply Flawed His ruling is believed to mark the first time in the nations history that any court has invalidated an act of Congress as an impermissible establishment of religion The Reagan Administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court calling the decision deeply flawed Former Senator Jeremiah Denton an Alabama Republican who was a leading sponsor of the law said in an interview Monday that about 14 million a year in Federal funds was at stake Mr Denton said he introduced the legislation to provide an alternative to Planned Parenthood which offers family planning counseling that includes contraception and abortion as alternatives Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union say the law authorizes the use of Federal funds to subsidize religious indoctrination as a means of opposing premarital sex abortion and birth control for teenagers Excessive Entanglement Seen In the lower court ruling Judge Richey said the law had a valid purpose but struck it down because it also had the primary effect of advancing religion and fosters excessive entanglement between government and religion He added The statute explicitly permits religious organizations to be grantees and envisions a direct role for those organizations in the education and counseling components of AFLA grants Janet Benshoof director of the civil liberties unions Reproductive Freedom Project said in an interview today that religious organizations including agencies of the Roman Catholic Church have received money under the law One parochial school was using Federal money in its religious education classes she said The chastity act allowed that In the appeal acted on today government lawyers said Judge Richeys ruling rests on brittle legal premises adding As a consequence large numbers of unmarried teenagers some pregnant and others likely to become so may lose vital benefits that Congress intended them to have Judge Richey had ordered that no Federal money be given to religious organizations but Chief Justice William H Rehnquist earlier postponed the effect of that order until the Supreme Court considered the Governments appeal Bowen v Kendrick No 87253 The Justices will also study an ACLU cross appeal of Judge Richeys ruling that the law could be salvaged by halting all financing of religious organizations In other matters the Court took these actions Civil Rights It agreed to decide in a Wisconsin case how difficult it should be to sue in state courts public officials accused of violating Federal civil rights laws The case is an appeal by a black man who said white Milwaukee police officers used excessive force and falsely arrested him Felder v Casey No 87526 Price Controls It turned away an appeal by an Alabama oil company executive ordered to pay the Government about 20 million for violating Federal price controls in the 197374 oil embargo Chamberlain v United States No 87140 Drunken Drivers It left intact a ruling that New Jersey officials say will make it more difficult to prosecute alleged drunken drivers after they have been cleared of more serious charges in traffic accidents New Jersey v DeLuca No 87506 Prison Libraries It refused to limit the right of prison inmates to visit libraries when researching their own legal cases Monge v Straub 87375
WHITE HOUSE SAYS PROBABLE NOMINEE IS JUDGE KENNEDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/us/white-house-says-probable-nominee-is-judge-kennedy.html,The White House said today that Judge Anthony M Kennedy would probably be nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court The statement by the White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that Mr Kennedy a Federal appeals court judge from Sacramento Calif would probably be President Reagans choice was a break with recent practice Another White House official said the Administration was discussing the likely nominee openly this time even though officials declined to do that in the past so the White House does not find itself surprised by criticism after the nomination is made Mr Fitzwater hedged his statement by saying that unforeseen circumstances could force another choice Meese Lobbies in Capitol A senior White House official said that both the White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d were agreeing on the choice of Judge Kennedy so I dont see how anybody else can find a power center to be a viable candidate Mr Meese went to the Capitol today to lobby for Judge Kennedy among senators who might oppose the nomination Some conservatives have expressed concern that Judge Kennedy would not uphold Mr Reagans conservative positions but there seems to be no groundswell of conservative opposition One prominent conservative Senator Jesse Helms a North Carolina Republican who said last week that he would fight a Kennedy nomination said today that he would keep an open mind Backbiting within the Administration sharpened today because of the embarrassment caused when Judge Douglas H Ginsburg withdrew his nomination Saturday after disclosing that he had smoked marijuana several times in the 1960s and 1970s Mr Reagan asked if he was embarrassed by the failure of Judge Ginsburgs nomination said No but I think there are others that should be He did not elaborate FBI Inquiry Is Begun The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had begun an inquiry to determine whether Federal agents mishandled background investigations that failed to detect past marijuana use by Judge Ginsburg [ Page D34 ] Officials and conservatives in and out of Government alternately blamed Mr Meese who lobbied strongly for Judge Ginsburgs nomination and Mr Baker who preferred Judge Kennedy They also criticized Education Secretary William J Bennett who called Judge Ginsburg last Friday and urged him to withdraw after having been given a green light Bennett aides said by President Reagan Mr Reagan said today that the judge chose to withdraw in view of the harassment that was coming Asked from whom such harassment came he said I think its very evident Mr Reagan later said Judge Ginsburg had used the right word for his departure in his withdrawal statement and that was the clamor that arose Bennett Call to Ginsburg On Friday both White House and Department of Education officials said Mr Bennett had called Mr Reagan to say he wanted to tell Judge Ginsburg that he ought to consider withdrawing At that time both White House and Education Department officials said Mr Reagan told Mr Bennett Do what you think is right Today Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is a member of the Judiciary Committee said he was doggone mad that people at the White House started to undermine Judge Ginsburg He said the President was surrounded by gutless wonders and Senator Hatch was only one in a string of conservative voices making similar complaints But at the White House today Mr Fitzwater blamed members of news organizations and an Education Department official in part saying they had given the misleading impression that President Reagan had urged Mr Bennett to make the call to Judge Ginsburg The President did not intend to acquiesce or give direction or approve or in any way endorse Secretary Bennetts actions he said adding that he had told Mr Bennetts spokesman that in no uncertain terms Reaction at Education Agency At the Education Department today officials were taken aback by the White House remarks This really proves that no good deed goes unpunished a department official said adding The original story of the BennettReagan conversation came from the White House not the Education Department On Saturday morning before Judge Ginsburg withdrew a White House official directly involved in the nomination process was asked whom Mr Bennett was speaking for and he answered Everybody A White House official acknowledged that the recriminations today about the final hours of Judge Ginsburgs nomination were intended to calm conservatives some of whom are already restive about Judge Kennedys probable nomination One of them Senator Hatch said he was concerned that Judge Kennedy would not uphold Mr Reagans conservative positions He also voiced concern that foes of the President might find ammunition in Judge Kennedys past as a lobbyist in California Many moderate and liberal senators have said they could support Judge Kennedy who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco There does not appear to be strong conservative opposition to Judge Kennedy even some conservatives who say they are not sure they like him add that they cannot find sufficient reasons to fight the nomination Conservative Backs Judge Richard A Viguerie a leading conservative consultant said Judge Kennedy is a true moderate and if he is nominated it would be a great victory for liberal senators Still he and others said conservatives are not going to go out and mount any organized effort against Kennedy Theyll just probably sit on their hands But Senator Hatch one of the most visible supporters of the first nominee Judge Robert H Bork said today Right now Im not supporting anybody adding that he had a lot of problems with Judge Kennedy Later today Attorney General Meese met with Senator Hatch and afterward Senator Hatch said It looks like its going to be Kennedy Senator Helms the North Carolina Republican had earlier said he intended to fight Judge Kennedys nomination But today Senator Helms said he would keep an open mind on the nomination A close associate of Senator Helms said Judge Kennedy was scheduled to see the Senator on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning Although Judge Kennedy has taken sonservative positions on most rulings many of his written opinions suggest he may not be the hardline ideologue that many conservatives want For example some conservatives have said they worry that Judge Kennedy may not be committed to overturning Roe vs Wade the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion Judge Kennedys opinions do not make clear where he stands on the question Judge Kennedy flew to Washington on Saturday and Senator Baker and Mr Meese interviewed him on Sunday Mr Fitzwater said the judge had not met with the President But a senior White House official said the Presidents advisers did discuss Judge Kennedy with Mr Reagan this evening The final decision has not been made and other candidates are being kept in mind as potential options he added Were gathering some additional material he said We want to make sure we find out everything about these guys
WASHINGTON TALK: Republican Politics; Complaints From the Right Flank Fall Squarely on the White House,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/us/washington-talk-republican-politics-complaints-right-flank-fall-squarely-white.html,In a city that relishes political paradox few examples were more exquisite than the sight of Senator Orrin G Hatch a Reagan loyalist par excellence standing in front of television cameras Monday and railing against gutless wonders in the White House The Utah Republican who has vigorously championed the Presidents case on issues from abortion to the Irancontra affair spoke not only for himself but also for a legion of conservative leaders and lobbyists They watched last week in anger frustration and finally resignation as the nomination of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg to the Supreme Court began to unravel and an embarrassed White House moved quickly if not altogether gracefully to cut him loose Can you imagine Hatchs pique on this asked Daniel L Casey president of the American Conservative Union Orrin Hatch has carried more water for this Administration on judicial nominations than anybody He did it for Manion he did it for Bork and he was already doing it for Ginsburg Mr Casey was referring to Daniel A Manion the Federal appellate judge confirmed by a single vote in the Senate last July and to Judge Robert H Bork whose nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated last month after a bruising Senate battle Flat Shut Out From Reagan Until nearly the moment last Saturday afternoon when Judge Ginsburg withdrew Mr Hatch maintained that the nomination could be won if only the White House would stick by the nominee It was a message he was unable to deliver to the President It was the first time in the whole time Ive known the President that I couldnt get throught to him Senator Hatch said today I was just flat shut out from my own President Mr Hatch said that he called the White House several times Saturday to speak directly to Mr Reagan but that he believed the President was never told of his calls Many of us up here the Senator said of his conservative colleagues on Capitol Hill feel hes being shielded from his real friends and being fed a steady diet of philosophy not in tune with his own But Kevin Phillips a Republican political analyst who predicted the rise of the Republican conservative movement but has been increasingly critical of President Reagans stewardship of it said he thought Mr Hatch and the conservative lobbying groups in Washington might have lost touch with the grassroots Republicans responsible for putting Mr Reagan in the White House Conservatives he said are doing what all elites ultimately do confusing their ideology with what the grass roots really want ConservativeMovement Types Two decades ago the trend of conservative politics was grassroots activists and antipointy headed intellectuals Mr Phillips said Now they are the ones nominating pointyheaded intellectuals to the Supreme Court Mr Phillips blamed what he called conservativemovement types around Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d for the nomination of Judge Ginsburg These are the people who wear Adam Smith ties and attend meetings commemorating dead Austrian economists he said mocking the Justice Departments search for jurists who subscribe to a philosophy of judcial restraint and to a doctrine of original intent in interpreting the Constitution Even before Judge Ginsburgs acknowledgement of his occasional marijuana use in the 1960s and 1970s the 41yearold appeals court judge and former Harvard law professor was not a candidate with much appeal to the average Republican Mr Phillips argued If they had just taken an ordinary Federal appeals court judge someone known to the local Republican organization and the chamber of commerce that kind of person would have a lot more relationship to the average voter than a Bork or a Ginsburg Mr Phillips said What the White House needed after Mr Borks defeat he continued was a plain vanilla Republican not more conservative intellectuals with esoteric ideological fish to fry Mr Phillips sees the Bork and Ginsburg failures as a spreading defeat for conservatives What began with Bork and broadened with Ginsburg has now become a question mark about the strategic competence of the conservative movement he said Hatch Sees Loss of Principles Senator Hatch is not prepared to go that far The conservative movement is alive and very well he said But it feels somewhat betrayed by whats going on in this White House which has consistently moved away from certain principles to compromise Mr Hatch declined to name those on the White House staff whom he blamed for shielding the President from others opinions or for compromising on issues dear to conservatives He described them only as senior White House officials and refused to say whether that description did or did not apply to Mr Reagans chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr We shouldnt be in this position Mr Hatch said Bork should have been confirmed and Ginsburg could have been confirmed if the White House hadnt wimped out And how has the White House taken such criticism from one of its staunchest Senate allies Im a pariah down there to certain people Mr Hatch said I assume some people at the White House are very irritated with me and thats tough After seven years I dont have to explain anything to them The Senator said that he understood Mr Reagan was interested in speaking to him today and that they would probably have an opportunity to talk soon Part of his message to the President Mr Hatch said will be I believe he is in danger of having much of what he has stood for over the last seven years go down the drain in this last year
REAGAN NOMINATES ANTHONY KENNEDY TO SUPREME COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/us/reagan-nominates-anthony-kennedy-to-supreme-court.html,President Reagan stung by the failure of two nominations to the Supreme Court in the last three weeks today nominated Judge Anthony M Kennedy and expressed the hope that he could be confirmed quickly in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation Mr Reagan emphasized that Judge Kennedy seems to be popular with many senators of varying political persuasions The experience of the last several months has made all of us a bit wiser he said [ Transcript page B10 ] Mr Reagans tone today was in marked contrast to the sharply partisan terms in which he presented his previous nominee Judge Douglas H Ginsburg two weeks ago Then the President called the Senates rejection of his first nominee Judge Robert H Bork a disservice to the Court and to the nation and said that the American people will know whats up if the Senate did not act quickly Delighted to Be Picked Judge Kennedy in his brief appearance before White House reporters today was asked whether he was upset that you are in effect the third choice for this seat Im delighted with this nomination he replied with a slight smile Senators from both parties said they would reserve judgment and examine the new nominees record closely But beneath the studiously noncommittal responses was a general expectation that Judge Kennedy would be confirmed as well as collective relief that another bruising battle could probably be avoided Still the moment was a bitter one for a number of conservatives both on and off Capitol Hill They viewed Mr Reagan as abandoning one of the principal goals of his Presidency that of changing the direction of the Supreme Court Biden Pledges Cooperation Key Democrats said that confirmation hearings would almost certainly not begin until January The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Joseph R Biden Jr said Im glad the President has made his choice We will get the process under way and move as rapidly as is prudent We want to conduct the committees review with both thoroughness and dispatch Judge Kennedy a 51yearold Harvard Law School graduate was named in 1975 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which covers California and several other Western states In writing nearly 500 opinions he has earned a reputation as a careful judge of basically conservative leanings who approaches legal problems case by case and has apparently never evinced a desire to change the modern course of constitutional law Some scholars who have studied his record say his approach is similar to that of Justice Lewis F Powell Jr whose retirement last June created the vacancy on the Supreme Court Justice Powell was a nonideological conservative who often cast the deciding vote on the sharply polarized Court Was on Earlier List By contrast President Reagans first choice Judge Bork whom the Senate rejected last month by a vote of 58 to 42 is an acerbic critic of many recent trends in the law The public learned little of the views of the next choice Judge Ginsburg who withdrew on Saturday two days after disclosing that he used marijuana once as a student in the 1960s and several times in the 1970s while a professor at Harvard Law School Judge Kennedy asked today whether he had ever smoked marijuana said No firmly no After Judge Borks defeat Mr Reagan was on the verge of choosing Judge Kennedy when Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d prevailed on him to pick the 41yearold Judge Ginsburg instead Judge Kennedys name was on a list of 13 potential nominees that Howard H Baker Jr the Presidents chief of staff presented to Senate leaders after Judge Borks defeat While the Democrats objected to some names on the list including that of Judge Ginsburg they raised no objection to Judge Kennedy Some conservative Republicans objected that Judge Kennedy was not conservative enough but the prospect of serious opposition from the right faded this week as Judge Kennedys nomination appeared all but inevitable I doubt that any conservatives are going to oppose him Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who Monday excoriated the White House for not standing by Judge Ginsburg said today In turning this time to a consensus nominee President Reagan was yielding to a political reality that includes Democratic control of the Senate and his own weakened powers as he enters his last year in office Theres been a basic compromise of principle thats not satisfying to me Senator Charles E Grassley an Iowa Republican said Tuesday as word circulated that Judge Kennedys nomination was virtually assured But I suppose Im resigned Theres a practical aspect Asked whether President Reagan had a choice other than compromise Senator Grassley a member of the Judiciary Committee replied If I were President of the United States I think Id figure one out Richard A Viguerie a conservative political consultant said in an interview that the mood among conservatives was one of total anger and frustration He called the Kennedy nomination a total surrender to the left Battle Fatigue a Factor Other conservative leaders struck a more fatalistic note There isnt another Bob Bork out there and we knew that all along said Daniel Casey president of the American Conservative Union When the dust settles people will regard this as a good choiceFurthermore Mr Casey said Theres institutional battle fatigue involved here From the liberal end of the political spectrum there was a striking difference between the reception Judge Kennedy received today muted though it was and the warning notes that greeted Judge Bork and Judge Ginsburg Senator Edward M Kennedy who led a harsh attack on Judge Bork and described Judge Ginsburg as Judge Bork without the paper trail said today only that he was interested in studying the new nominees lengthy judicial record I look forward to the hearings and to meeting Judge Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat said Laurence H Tribe the Harvard Law School professor and a liberal who has been a close adviser to Senator Biden said in an interview that his initial impressions of Judge Kennedy were very favorable His opinions are more sensitive than strident Mr Tribe said He replaces the dogmatism of Robert Bork with a sense of decency and moderation But despite Judge Kennedys voluminous record little has been gleaned so far about his views on key issues on which the Supreme Court is closely divided These include abortion affirmative action and the relationship between church and state Senator Patrick J Leahy of Vermont a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee said he expected the hearings to be substantive Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania the only Republican on the committee to vote against Judge Bork said At first blush Judge Kennedy looks good but the Judiciary Committee will have to check out his qualifications very carefully as the Constitution requires The nominee himself said today Im looking forward to this scrutiny that the Senate should give any nominee in the discharge of its constitutional duty It was not only the lack of knowledge about Judge Kennedys views that caused senators to withhold the sweeping proclamations with which some of them had greeted the earlier nominees Republicans particularly those who had offered early support to Judge Ginsburg were afraid of getting burned again while the Democrats viewing the Supreme Court vacancy with some amusement a Republican problem see no need to take a position The Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia captured this mood today when he said I hope this nomination will provide no more surprises to the Congress or embarrassment to the White House
Three to Make Ready,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/opinion/three-to-make-ready.html,LEAD What does a stubborn President do when he fails to win Senate confirmation of his choice for the Supreme Court and then deliberately casts his next nominee in the same mold only to fail again Until Ronald Reagan that double trouble had befallen only two Presidents in 100 years Grover Cleveland a Democrat and Richard M What does a stubborn President do when he fails to win Senate confirmation of his choice for the Supreme Court and then deliberately casts his next nominee in the same mold only to fail again Until Ronald Reagan that double trouble had befallen only two Presidents in 100 years Grover Cleveland a Democrat and Richard M Nixon a Republican How each made his third choice offers guidance on the art and risk of wooing the Senate  and hope for the confirmation of Judge Anthony M Kennedy Mr Reagans latest nominee Like President Reagan Presidents Cleveland and Nixon brought their twin failures upon themselves by pushing too hard for a political edge In Clevelands case the politics descended almost to the clubhouse level He was feuding over patronage with David B Hill a powerful Senator from his own state New York In 1893 Cleveland pointedly avoided any consultation with Senator Hill in naming a fellow New Yorker to the Court Mr Hill invoked senatorial courtesy and enlisted enough colleagues to defeat the nomination The President bypassed him again with another nominee from New York and again Mr Hill rallied the Senate against him this time by a wider margin Furious but resourceful Cleveland found a strategem to make a third nomination stick though he had to abandon New Yorkers He named the Senate majority leader Edward Douglass White a wellrespected Louisiana Democrat the Senate confirmed him unanimously the very day it received his name Justice White who survived Cleveland and became Chief Justice in 1910 never gave him cause to regret his choice Then there is the Nixon example A Court seat went empty for almost a year while Mr Nixon tried to exploit it for his Southern political strategy  the plan to woo George Wallace voters to the GOP for the 1972 Presidential campaign In August 1969 to fill the vacancy Mr Nixon nominated a Federal judge who was Republican conservative a strict constructionist of the Constitution strong on law and order  all this and a Southerner too The formula produced Clement F Haynsworth Jr Chief Judge of the court of appeals in South Carolina The nomination ran afoul of a conflictofinterest issue No one showed that he had profited from sitting on cases in which his stock portfolio might have given him a financial stake but his critics charged that his failure to remove himself from some cases had given the appearance of impropriety Seventeen Republican Senators joined liberal Democrats in turning him down 5545 Mr Nixon clung to his formula and Attorney General John N Mitchell scraped up a Floridian named G Harrold Carswell who had been seated on a Federal court of appeals only a year before Judge Carswells legal and intellectual deficiencies soon emerged to identify him as a paragon of mediocrity He inspired a celebrated endorsement by Senator Roman H Hruska of Nebraska There are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers Arent they entitled to a little representation and a little chance By 51 to 45 the Senate thought not Mr Nixon made what he could of the defeat in a bitter statement championing the South against the allegedly antiSouthern Senate majority By necessity he said he would seek a nominee elsewhere He announced his choice within a week and had him confirmed unanimously within a month The new Justice a Federal court of appeals veteran and a close old friend and colleague of Mr Nixons own Chief Justice Warren Burger was Harry A Blackmun of Minnesota Perhaps it was something more than poetic justice that the final Nixon choice proved a classically unpredictable independentminded judge with a growing respect for liberal values He is best known as the author in 1973 of the Courts decision on abortions in Roe v Wade Like his two predecessors Mr Reagan has finally yielded to the imperative of winning in the Senate After the fiasco of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg he had to abandon his preference for a tamperproof ideologue in the Robert H Bork image He pointedly introduced Judge Kennedy as something the critics said Judge Bork was not a true conservative Much more will be known of Judge Kennedy after fierce scrutiny by the media and Senate Judiciary Committee But little is likely to emerge more to his credit than the unease his prospective nomination stirred among rightwingers Little could help him more in this Senate than a decision by Jesse Helms of North Carolina to carry out an early threat to filibuster against him To choose a conservative who is not doctrinaire enough for the hard right is to run the risk of creating a Justice who does not vote a party line Thanks to his own overreaching and bungling and his lame duck timetable President Reagan has now been reduced to taking that risk if he is to fill the seat at all
Restrained Pragmatist - Anthony McLeod Kennedy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/us/restrained-pragmatist-anthony-mcleod-kennedy.html,SAN FRANCISCO  In the modern world of family turmoil the life of Judge Anthony McLeod Kennedy seems almost like a living Norman Rockwell portrait of provincial constancy and familial loyalty He has been married to the same woman for 24 years has sent all three of his children to his alma mater Stanford University and lives in the same white colonialstyle house in Sacramento behind a camelia bush and a neat row of gardenias where he was born 51 years ago Such restraint and respect for precedent find an echo in the legal opinions of the man President Reagan has picked as his third choice to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court And if the President had originally hoped to fill the seat with a doctrinaire conservative he will not find that in Judge Kennedy an energetic selfeffacing and immensely polite man who likes to read history complain about his deteriorated golf game and taste fine California wines While Tony Kennedy as friends call him is clearly a political and legal conservative he strikes those who know him as a quiet pragmatic one open to persuasion His 500 or so written opinions in 12 years on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco are cautiously and narrowly crafted sticking close to precedent and avoiding sweeping statements on social issues Judge Kennedy sits well to the right of center of the 36 regular and senior judges of the Ninth Circuit which has been badly divided on such issues as immigration and criminal rights But he is by no means on the extreme It is very hard to read Tonys opinions and see his personal philosophy come through but if you add up the results you can tell he is a conservative said a fellow appeals judge a liberal who often disagrees with Judge Kennedy and who requested anonymity But he is thoughtful and fair You can talk to and reason with him He may come back with the wrong position but hell go and think about it You dont say it was a waste of time His ideology does not hang all over him Another fellow judge Alex Kozinski a conservative who was once a clerk to Judge Kennedy said He does not have some broad theory of the law that he tries to fit every case into He added that the judge was above all a lawyer Judge Kennedy is an active member of the Roman Catholic Church which has led opposition to abortion and homosexual behavior but his personal views on those issues could not be readily determined And while some of his court opinions have offended womens and homosexual groups colleagues say he has no rigid positions on these issues Does Not Go Off on Tangents He reaches opinions only to the extent you need to said another former clerk J Clark Kelso He does not go off on tangents about social policy Mr Kelso cited the case in which Judge Kennedy upheld the right of the Navy to discharge a sailor for homosexual conduct but avoided the broader question of the legality of sexual relations between consenting adults Lawyers describe Judge Kennedy as extremely bright but not brilliant in the way that Judge Robert H Bork is While they have not all liked his decisions liberal and conservative lawyers alike praise Judge Kennedys temperament If you picture a Federal judge he does not fit it said Ronald Zumbrun director of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento He has a low ego threshold he has no airs about him He is a normal person Although he seldom prevails with Judge Kennedy Barry Portman the Federal public defender in San Francisco concurs calling him one of the most pleasant judges to argue before He added I never found he had a private agenda or ideology He was conservative but never tried to reach some holding not justified by the facts If he has a consistent criminal judicial philosophy I am not prepared to say what it is The 1987 edition of The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary gives this distillation of lawyers views of him Courteous stern on the bench somewhat conservative bright well prepared filled with nervous energy asks many questions good analytical mind not afraid to break new ground open minded good business lawyer hard to peg an enigma tends to agonize over opinions Hes More Provincial Colleagues say his style marked by boyish enthusiasm contrasts markedly with the apparently more worldly Judges Robert H Bork and Douglas H Ginsburg who were chosen ahead of him for the job Nobody will find anything in his opinions or personal life that will raise any problems

the opera Judge Kennedy was born into Republican politics on July 23 1936 His mother Gladys was a prominent civic booster and his father Anthony J Kennedy was a politically connected lawyer and lobbyist in Sacramento who was associated with Artie Samish a powerful lobbyist and fixer who ultimately went to jail for tax evasion At the age of 10 the youth took a year off from school to serve as

Lawyer After graduation Kennedy joined a law firm in San Francisco and in 1963 married Mary Jeanne Davis who now teaches elementary school in Sacramento That year was a turning point in the young lawyers life His father died of a heart attack leaving his personal financial affairs in extraordinary disarray The son returned to Sacramento sacrificing a potentially lucrative practice in San Francisco to take over his fathers solo practice and help the family In his confirmation hearings for the Federal appeals court in 1975 Kennedy characterized his law practice as widely diversified including people with individual legal problems divorce minor criminal probate matters my acquaintances from my many years in Sacramento and some very major companies But the bulk of his practice he told the committee was representing businesses in the middle of the spectrum His cases were mostly garden variety disputes such as a condemnation case involving a development company whose owners

1973 He was appointed to the appeals court in 1975 by President Ford Judge Kennedy does not appear to have accumulated much wealth His Federal financial disclosure statements show he has no more than 200000 in assets not including his residence An issue that may arise in confirmation hearings is his membership in the all male Olympic Club a private social group in San Francisco since 1962 According to press reports here he resigned from the club last month when he was under consideration for the nomination before Judge Ginsburg was chosen Such exclusionary clubs have come under increasingly wide criticism particularly from womens groups His life in recent years has been marked by sorrow His only brother died in a surfing accident in Hawaii his only sister died of cancer and

constitutional law once a week at the McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific in Sacramento He is a hard grader but much admired by his students They are stunned to see this man walk in and give a threehour dissertation and Socratic dialogue without ever looking at a note said the dean Gordon D Schaber who called the energetic judge a human hydroelectric project It was a way of

Give the 60's Generation a Break,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/14/opinion/give-the-60-s-generation-a-break.html,With President Reagans nomination of Judge Anthony M Kennedy to the Supreme Court the Ginsburg marijuana episode is gone but not forgotten For days the Washington Establishment  though not most of the public  recoiled with horror after the disclosure that Judge Ginsburg had smoked pot How could a onetime dopesmoker however rightwing on economic and legal matters ever earn his way onto the Supreme Court Subsequently two Democratic Presidential hopefuls Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee and Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona came clean that they too had tried marijuana when younger One need scarcely be supporters of Judge Ginsburg Senator Gore and Governor Babbitt we both are not to think that the marijuana flap signifies that something beyond individual careers is at stake The question is How will the generation that came of age in the 1960s find its way into political life Judge Ginsburg no radical then or now belongs to a generation whose members sought to remake the world and themselves Many were the routes many the extravagances No authority was exempt from scrutiny affront devaluation It became normal though not universal to experiment with drugs sex and politics Closets minds and roads to transcendence glory utopia and sheer fun were opened Experiments that started in small circles rippled outward sometimes in earnest sometimes in emulation Motives were complicated and blurred drugs could be a channel to God an evenings recreation a chronic dependency The spunky young transgressed and by the mid70s so did the timid and conformist As a consequence what serious 40yearold public figure  or journalist doctor lawyer professor film maker and corporate executive  doesnt have behind or her at least some familiarity with nonalcoholic drugs unorthodox sex cohabitation abortion divorce and political demonstration How many on elite campuses didnt smoke marijuana at least casually Americas centuryold cultural civil war between modernizers and traditionalists between proponents of freedom and of order drew fresh life from the upsurges of the 60s the civil rights antiwar and womens and gay movements as well as drugs public eroticism and the eradication of social taboos Counterspasms of moralism by those aiming to repeal the various legacies of the 60s have reached a crescendo during the Reagan years American conservatives barely keeping economic racial and ecological crises at bay have lashed out indiscriminately Now even a judicial conservative can get flayed Few members of the 60s generation were inclined toward political careers antiauthoritarian to the core the generation disdained even its own leaders Now that the generation is beginning to put leadership forward it confronts yet again the proponents of order declaring that ye who have had too much fun shall never be permitted through the portals of power The spasm of horror at Judge Ginsburgs erstwhile smoking practices suggests that the cultural civil war has surfaced in a curious way The line dividing public from private life is being blurred Sometimes private life is of legitimate public concern especially when it entails corruption and deception  but often it is not Instead of careful distinctions we are witnessing an unprecedented surge of moralism directed at public officials private lives Private sin is now regarded as a soiling of the public sphere which the rightminded must hasten to purge The traditionalist side of the culture war wants our authorities  our politicians and judges  either squeaky clean or impeccably discreet either saints or good liars But neither sainthood nor slickness has anything to do with the wisdom intelligence skill courage and vision that public life requires Obsessed by pecadilloes moralist politics is driving talent away Since transgression was the common coin of the 60s tens of millions who took some part in the upsurges now run the risk of being disfranchised The generation that ended a dreadful war and brought the grievances of blacks and women into politics must be allowed its due place if national renewal is to follow the evasions and corruptions of the 80s Yes 60s experiments turned to excess and lives were damaged The surge toward freedom often on the cheap was riddled with selfindulgence It should come as no surprise that few members of that generation today are as cavalier about many things including drugs as they were in their teens and 20s But if lifelong lawfulness is a prerequisite for public life who will volunteer but drones and masochists Which college students of the 60s could pass the moral means test of the 50s Dare we hope that moralists of all stripes whether in politics or the press will acknowledge that the 60s took place and call a halt to prurient inquisitions
"Hearth at Harvard, Heart and Soul at High Court",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/14/us/hearth-at-harvard-heart-and-soul-at-high-court.html,Laurence H Tribe may have his office in the bookish confines of the Harvard Law School But in a sense his heart and soul lie 380 miles to the southwest in Washington at the United States Supreme Court As a member of the Harvard law faculty for the last 19 years the 46yearold Mr Tribe has scrutinized the High Court more conspicuously and from more vantage points than perhaps any other scholar in the country He has studied it taught about it written about it opined and testified on it and on many occasions argued before it By now in fact he has done just about everything but serve on it a prospect that intrigues many people including Mr Tribe himself 3 Networks Sought Comment Indeed in recent years it seems as if any event pertaining to the Supreme Court is not complete until Mr Tribe has commented on it invariably in pithy or alliterative prose After President Reagan nominated Judge Anthony M Kennedy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to the Supreme Court on Wednesday Mr Tribe was interviewed on the evening news programs of all three networks in each case appearing to lend his imprimatur to the choice On the ABC News World News Tonight for instance he opined that Judge Kennedys opinions showed more decency than dogmatism more sensitivity than stridency Late last month Mr Tribes preeminence in the field of constitutional law found corroboration of a more dubious sort An inspection conducted after his secretaries heard suspicious noises on his office telephone revealed that a wiretap had been placed on it Phone company officials said the device was apparently installed several months ago The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General are investigating Mr Tribe declined to discuss the wiretap But on Monday he retained Philip A Lacovera a Washington lawyer who is former counsel to the Watergate Special Prosecutor to conduct an investigation of his own Reason for Tap Is Unclear Why anyone would want to monitor the professors phone calls is unclear What is clear though is that more than anyone else he is the intellectual architect of the more expansive and aggressive role the Senate is now taking in reviewing President Reagans Supreme Court nominations a role that culminated last month in the rejection of Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia It was moreover Mr Tribe who helped prepare the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for Judge Borks confirmation hearings and who in the carefully choreographed parade of witnesses served as the keynote speaker for the opposition 12 Appearances Before Court There are those who believe the Bork case may not have been the reason for the wiretap it is not the only controversy involving high stakes in which Mr Tribe has recently been embroiled Earlier this year he successfully represented Pennzoil in pressing one phase of its 10 billion antitrust suit against Texaco before the Supreme Court It was by his count the 12th time he had appeared before the High Court in the last decade and the ninth time he had prevailed The role played by the professor in defeating Judge Bork has raised anew a favorite subject of speculation in the competitive and catty world of legal academia Mr Tribes own prospects for a Supreme Court seat in some future Democratic Administration A Tribe appointment has long been talked about But at issue now is whether the review process he helped design for the Bork nomination could one day boomerang on him and whether he could come a cropper on the same set of obstacles that helped trip up Judge Bork his academic writings his longheld views on controversial issues and his visibility Mr Tribes detractors who have long considered him immodest and overly ambitious tend to discount that possibility They maintain the professor has long allied himself to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and they say his help in defeating Judge Bork was a calculated effort to endear himself further To his admirers however his decision to take so conspicuous a role in so nasty a debate was a profile in courage In opposing Judge Bork they note Mr Tribe ran the risk not only of antagonizing a future member of the High Court but of turning himself into a lightning rod for conservative groups Sitting in his office this week in Griswold Hall in Cambridge Mass clad in corduroy pants and running shoes Mr Tribe said he was not terribly concerned I Saw There Were Risks I tried not to think about the very long run he said I saw there were risks in being as open and vocal as I was that it would have been far safer for me to just hold my peace But in the end I decided that things I cared very much about were really at risk that I really didnt have very much choice Ive said what I believed as carefully as I could If people dont find that a positive quality so be it Mr Tribe was born in Shanghai in 1941 and moved with his family to California at the end of the war As a Harvard undergraduate he majored in algebraic topology but impressed by the greater human relevance of legal issues he enrolled in Harvard Law School The only unusual thing about his career there was that he did not make the Harvard Law Review a failure he attributes to a parsimonious professor of property law He nonetheless was a clerk for Justice Potter Stewart of the Supreme Court Since returning to Harvard in 1968 Mr Tribe has written 11 books including a widely used and widely quoted treatise on constitutional law Before the Supreme Court he has advocated homosexual rights a moratorium on nuclear power projects and busing to achieve school integration Before Congress he has testified against antiabortion laws and a proposed constitutional convention The professors classes are habitually oversubscribed a result of both the inherent appeal of constitutional law and his own undeniable star status A joke making the rounds among Harvard law students this week was that the professor tapped his own phone so he would not miss a word he said Before the Bork nomination Mr Tribe had never opposed a Supreme Court nominee In recent years he said he supported the confirmation of Justices John Paul Stevens Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia and took no position on the elevation of William H Rehnquist to Chief Justice But in his 1985 book God Save This Honorable Court Mr Tribe urged the Senate to abandon its quiescent posture The appointment of Supreme Court Justices is not minor surgery but the selection of lifetenured surgeons licensed to operate on the entire body politic he wrote While theoretically neutral Mr Tribes arguments provided the intellectual blueprint for the antiBork forces And as the hearings approached he played the role of the nominee in mock questionandanswer sessions held in the living room of Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee The dress rehearsals were most impressive according to Mark H Gitenstein chief counsel to the committee Tribe he said was a better Bork than Bork
FOOLING AROUND AND OTHER FAMILY HABITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/books/fooling-around-and-other-family-habits.html,TIME WITH CHILDREN By Elizabeth Tallent 158 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1595 IF in the past few years there has been a reactionary wave in the sexual revolution  with the literary corollary that men are best left after all to writing about guns tanks banks and hitchhiking and a womans place is in the home  Elizabeth Tallent has taken that counterrevolutionary view turned it inside out and made it work for her They chopped wood they lit the stove they kept busy the epigraph from Edna OBrien says here There is always something to do in a house Wood enough gets chopped in these stories but only as background for the worst deadly sins imperfectly attempted lust betrayal indifference to the needy overweening greed So you want me to write about a womans world Ms Tallent seems to be silently asking No problem But you may be sorry you asked Each one of these 13 stories is about the state of the family today what life is like inside American domestic walls whether the home is gentrified and spotless borrowed and English lovingly kept or simply home for an hour  a musty motel on a desert road Again Ms Tallent appears to address the question of why we think home and hearth is such a good idea right now why we choose to cleave once again to nuclear families why we choose to engage in that seemingly most natural of projects the having and raising of children In the title story Time With Children Kyra a desperately voguish young wife  sojourning for a year in London with Charles her husband a publisher and Nicholas her melancholy 4yearold son  falls in love with a pleasing playwright who forgoes a party in order to babysit Nick A man who volunteers to spend time with children No wonder Kyra is crazy about him But the dark subtext here is that the American couple have come to England to wean Charles from his unfortunate habit of philandering Kyra is spoiling for adventure and revenge Brian the playwright is getting over a bad love affair with an actress named Pippa all is definitely not right in his world Nicholas is left out in the cold as over a series of three stories Kyra Charles and Brian all ignorantly scramble greedy as bad children at a chaotic birthday party for love they shouldnt have and dont deserve  testing like bad kids just how much they can get away with before something really bad happens Two other families are examined here each in a series of stories set in stunning Western settings around Santa Fe Families are set up two ways on this ancient land the Hispanic network of aunts cousins grandparents and the Anglonuclearadolescent crazy method where a husband and wife marry only to flirt and reconsider and along the line have children In The Fence Party and Hannahs Example a handsome man we know only as Hart projects the white Protestant image of a liberal socially conscious devoted family man but he literally lives to charm deceive and womanize His first wife Hannah has sent her son to stay with his father and Caro a likable Nicaraguan woman whose whole extended family has managed to make places for itself all across the North American continent What position could be safer than that of the beloved second wife of a womanizer who appears finally to be settling down Except that in The Fence Party Hart for the sake of a fiveminute flirtation risks his own life to impress a pretty stranger with dyed hair And in Hannahs Example the bedraggled bereft first wife in a stunningly manipulative coup almost snags her man again Caro is  what else  pregnant facing a 20year stretch with children Theoretically theres time for an abortion but not with the dozens of family members on her side already preparing for the birth Her mothers fingers fly stitching arranging bringing together the delicate pieces A baby needs so many things In the third family that merits a series here Jenny a coldhearted little chiseler true soul mate to that rabbity Hart mentioned above is married to Sam whos bought her a dream house loves her dearly and wants to stay with her the rest of their lives Jennys not up for it For her life is fooling around stealing love thats not hers She routinely jeopardizes her supposedly idyllic marriage for an affair with a married Jewish surgeon who makes love to her on the couch in the corner of his office where she thought patients often got the bad news The commonsense question  why would Jenny want to spend time with this fellow rather than her devoted husband  is answered in another story where a fox just goes on stealing chickens because thats what foxes do Some people  the Harts the Jennys the Kyras the Charlies  arent made for family for honesty for whatever it is were all supposed to be doing with our lives THE sin here is not lust but theft Two children in these stories are nabbed for that petty crime both by sanctimonious grownups at the very margin of these tales Stealing equaled stealing affection the stylish Kyra exiled in London with her philandering husband reflects even as she herself philanders Its the children who take the rap for their outrageously irresponsible parents But can we change human nature any more than we can teach that thieving fox to keep his paws to himself Its in our nature to want more than we can get Ms Tallent insists here as she has in her previous collection In Constant Flight and her novel Museum Pieces Even Sam the perfect husband yearns for the wife on the other side of the meadow Given our imperfect nature our time with children may be a penance a travail a solitary confinement We may be doing time instead of spending it DUCK ITS HER CADILLAC For my eighteenth birthday Jack gave me a fiveyear diary with a latch and a little key light as a dime I was sitting beside him scratching at the lock which didnt want to work when he thought he saw his wifes Cadillac in the distance coming toward us

Planned Parenthood Warns of Abortion Surge,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/us/planned-parenthood-warns-of-abortion-surge.html,A study by Planned Parenthood projects a rapid increase in live births maternal deaths and selfinduced abortions worldwide if the Reagan Administration proceeds with a planned cutoff of funds for the groups international division The Federal Agency for International Development which administers foreign aid abroad will not renew its aid to Planned Parenthood because the group has refused to sign a pledge saying it will not give financial or other support to any programs abroad that perform advocate or advise women on abortion services The foolishness of this Administration is tragic said Faye Wattleton president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America She said that by next year the policy would prevent the organization from providing the family planning services that 14 million people in 41 countries now receive She also said the policy would prevent an expansion of the program to reach the millions more who need assistance Next month the policy will affect Planned Parenthoods international division Family Planning International Assistance when the current 89 million fiveyear agreement with the AID expires 311000 More Births Predicted The study made public Thursday was commissioned by Planned Parenthood and conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan They found that the cutoff of aid could lead to 311000 additional live births 69000 selfinduced abortions and 1200 more maternal deaths over the next three years Officials of the Federal aidadministering agency called the study terribly premature and said AID hoped to make a new fiveyear cooperative agreement with Planned Parenthood in January to include the antiabortion clause But Ms Wattleton indicated that the organization would not accept any agreement with such a clause A spokesman for the agency who declined to be identified said Planned Parenthood is trying to cast this whole dispute as a fight over family planning and its not  its a fight about abortion The Administration strongly supports family planning but opposes abortion The spokesman added We deal with hundreds of other organizations who are ready willing and able to perform family planning services without objecting to the abortion clauses The Adminstration announced at a family planning conference in Mexcio City in 1984 that it was adopting a stringent policy prohibiting private organizations that receive Federal funds from associating with any groups abroad that engaged in abortionrelated activities Out to Defund the Left This is an Administration thats out to defund the left and Planned Parenthood is the pelt theyve wanted on their wall for years said Dr Sharon Camp vice president of the Population Crisis Committee a private organization Planned Parenthood and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in New York last January seeking to overturn the policy The case was ruled as a nonjudiciable political issue but Planned Parenthood is appealing the decision We are optimistic that the decision will be reversed Ms Wattleton said The bottom line of this issue is who is going to suffer from this decision poor women in developing countries said Dr Joseph Speidel president of the Population Crisis Committee an international demographic organization
BOUNDARIES OF DESIRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/books/boundaries-of-desire.html,LEAD MAPS By Nuruddin Farah 246 pp New York Pantheon Books Cloth 1195 Paper 795 MAPS By Nuruddin Farah 246 pp New York Pantheon Books Cloth 1195 Paper 795  THIS is a novel about the politics of desire as well as a lyrical evocation of childhood but above all Maps is a book about borders boundaries and territorial ambitions what Nuruddin Farah calls pastures of the imagination The novel sets out to delineate with a cartographers scrupulousness the anguish of living on a continent where national boundaries have been drawn by foreign hands where geography merges with politics and where even though the old imperialists have departed their successors have inherited not only their powers but their maps In short this is a novel of modern Africa in which the growing pains of the orphan boy Askar and his inchoate fragmentary memories of his dead parents reflect the wider tragedy of a dismembered Somalia  a country split among the competing owners of its various territories Askar is a child with magical mysterious gifts whose coming to consciousness is both a personal biography and a history of the fierce war of liberation being waged in the Horn of Africa between the Western Somali Liberation Front in the cause of whose struggle both the boys mother and father have died and the Ethiopian forces that presently occupy the Ogaden The most notable feature of this strange poetic passionate narrative is the extraordinary way in which Nuruddin Farah transforms what might in other hands be an angry political treatise into a sensitive account of an orphan of the storms that in Africa pass under the name of politics And although the novel is set in the Horn of Africa it has applications that reach as far as my own country South Africa where questions of homelands have violent political repercussions and where the drawing of lines between people the making of maps and the meaning of words are ultimately matters for the police and the army Among the powers possessed by the boy Askar is his ability to move backward and forward in time to be present at his own birth and to peer into the future His relationship with Misra the woman who adopts him is described with savage tenderness and a brilliant accumulation of intimate detail Mr Farah who was born in 1945 and has written several novels has considerable lyrical gifts Askar is a kind of wonder child a boyman in some ways the Somali messiah the wise child of his people obsessed with the circumstances of his birth possibly his own midwife perhaps even his own creator since the existence of his parents is problematical Askar enjoys a relationship with Misra so close as to be almost incestuous and sufficiently powerful to cut them off from the rest of the world However it is Askars growing recognition that he must begin to discover his own independence that sets him on the path to political awareness and maturity It is no coincidence that Misra is not a Somali but an Ethiopian and it is Askars destiny to fight against Ethiopian domination of his mother country Such personal and political consonances are handled with great delicacy and imagination Misra herself is a remarkable creation warm motherly shrewd but at the same time sexually submissive devious and possibly a traitor to the Somali cause Even so the intense relationship between orphan and foreign mother provides the underlying strength of the novel and knits the whole together Among the richly woven incidents of their mutual dependence Askars observation of an abortion performed on his stepmother is one of the outstanding moments in the novel a description spare pungent unforgettable But their relationship is doomed by geography and politics Two events begin the inevitable separation of Askar and Misra there is his circumcision and the presentation to him of an atlas in which the topography of his desire becomes clear Askar begins deliberately to reunite the sundered sections of his homeland redrawing the map of the Somalispeaking territories copying it curve by curve Both as a child and then as a young man in Mogadishu by now a supporter of the Western Somali Liberation Front Askar must contemplate the personal tragedy of the Somali people scattered across Africa delivered by geographers into the hands of foreign armies And he must also confront the wider equally familiar struggle in Africa between the new imperialists the Russians in Ethiopia or the Cubans in Angola and live with the bitter knowledge that Africa is once again little more than a playfield where African armies are simply part of the reserve to be drawn on by the major powers in their new scramble for Africa Of course this is true and has a familiar ring to anyone alarmed by the spectacle of African countries caught in the trap between domestic incompetence and international interference Such is the force of Mr Farahs anger that it sometimes overshadows the delicate portraits at the heart of the novel And his allusive playful style in which the narrative moves between past and present with great rapidity is not always easy to follow But it is always the sincerity of the emotions and his ability to make them palpable that distinguish this tantalizing and original novel and make it a journey into what Mr Farah calls the territory of pain and what we rather loosely perhaps call Africa A MAN IN A MANTLE   You sit in contemplative posture your features agonized and your expressions pained you sit for hours and hours and hours sleepless looking into darkness hearing a small snore coming from the room next to yours And you conjure a past a past in which you see a horse drop its rider a past in which you discern a bird breaking out of its shell so it will fly into the heavens of freedom Out of the same past emerges a man wrapped in a mantle with unpatched holes each hole large as a window  and each window large as the secret to which you cling as though it were the only soul you possessed And you question you challenge every thought which crosses your mind Yes You are a question to yourself It is true Youve become a question to all those who meet you those who know you those who have any dealings with you You doubt at times if you exist outside your own thoughts outside your own head Misras or your own It appears as though you were a creature given birth to by notions formulated in heads a creature brought into being by ideas From Maps
LET DEMOCRATS BE DEMOCRATS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/books/let-democrats-be-democrats.html,THE LIFE OF THE PARTY Democratic Prospects in 1988 and Beyond By Robert Kuttner 265 pp New York Elisabeth Sifton BooksViking 1895 SUDDENLY Democratic prospects in 1988 look a little better and so do New Deal politics The stock markets troubles have left the nation longing for the sort of leadership Franklin D Roosevelt offered a kind of experimental activism that saw Government as potentially helpful in restoring order out of the chaos that markets can produce The timing of the crash is certainly fortunate for Robert Kuttner the economics correspondent for The New Republic He has issued a call for Democrats to return to what he sees as their central mission the espousal of progressive populism as a way of giving voice to the aspirations of the poor and average working families After several years in which Democratic policy debates often seemed to be but faint echoes of what the Republicans were talking about The Life of the Party is refreshing Mr Kuttner has a clear sense that policy and politics are closely linked  a realization that he sees at the heart of Ronald Reagans victories in 1980 and 1984 Unlike many liberals Mr Kuttner takes President Reagan and the conservative movement very seriously He does not pretend that Mr Reagan was effective politically in his first five years in office just because he learned to speak well on television while hosting Death Valley Days The author is especially impatient with the dry approaches of policy specialists who think a political party can come up with socalled pure solutions absolutely free of the influence of  God forbid  politics Voters are not as cynical as those who write about them often suggest they are but citizens want to get something tangible in return for their ballots For most of the last six years the Republicans delivered a lot of tangible benefits to the wealthy and some real benefits in the form of lower taxes and low interest rates to a substantial share of the middle class The Democrats left their traditional supporters  working people with little except promises to raise their taxes This is not how it used to be as Mr Kuttner shows convincingly Roosevelt offered Social Security publicworks jobs the Tennessee Valley Authority farm subsidies minimum wages and labor unions After World War II the Democrats gave veterans a large share of the population then two of the most important prerequisites of middleclass status free college educations and cheap mortgages And in 1984 the Democrats offered    deficit reduction  Tax and tax spend and spend is a scornful description of the Democrats popularized by Ronald Reagan Mr Kuttner writes But the original version of the phrase attributed to FDRs aide Harry Hopkins went Tax and tax spend and spend elect and elect  Mr Kuttner argues that in 1984 the Democrats offered tax and tax  to pay for deficits  without the spend and spend handing over the elect and elect to Ronald Reagan who preferred borrowing to taxing In retrospect Walter Mondale may well have been right about deficits But by making them the centerpiece of his campaign he cramped the Democrats social vision  and was not credible Voters knew instinctively that backing Democrats to balance the budget was like joining the American Civil Liberties Union to get prayer back into public schools Mr Kuttner builds on the analysis in The New Politics of Inequality 1984 by Thomas Byrne Edsall a Washington Post reporter to show how American politics has steadily tilted away from the concerns of the working and lowermiddle classes and toward those of the better off In the Democratic Party this skewed the discussion away from breadandbutter issues and toward an antiinterventionist foreign policy and cultural liberalism on such matters as abortion and womens rights Mr Kuttner understands how this cut the party off from its base Democrats more often than not tend to be liberal on a whole range of issues involving social tolerance he writes But only when the party delivers the economic goods to socially conservative workingclass voters is it forgiven for its social cosmopolitanism It takes a Harry Hopkins to buy the political space for an Eleanor Roosevelt And he adds What the party cannot be is an awkward alliance between rich eccentrics and the dependent poor But Mr Kuttner explicitly ignores foreign policy and cultural issues in effect telling Democrats to shut up on these issues and let economic populism carry them to power This is the central weakness of his analysis It leads him to underplay the extent to which Democratic victories have often depended on welloff voters who stuck with the party because they liked its stands on civil rights civil liberties and foreign policy Many of these voters might be scared off by Mr Kuttners populist economics  though Mr Kuttner believes that by mobilizing less welloff people who do not now vote populism would more than make up for the losses Yet he deals only in passing with the fact that many of the poor white voters he wants in his populist coalition find Democratic foreign policy far too soft What does the party have to say to them If Mr Kuttner is not clear on how the Democrats should deal with cultural and foreign policy issues he is extremely insightful on how to rebuild an alliance between blacks and whites of moderate income Unlike some of the liberals he criticizes Mr Kuttner does not try to paint the white working class as racist What Democrats failed to do he says was show how Government programs could be used not only to assist the poor but also to shore up the standard of living of the middle class Mr Kuttner would do this by following Roosevelt and Truman in offering specific benefits help for people to buy their first houses and educate their children and real training assistance for those thrown out of work by economic change Call his program the New Fair Deal He also warns Democrats against a wholesale assault on entitlement programs The genius of such initiatives as Social Security he says is that they provide benefits to everyone notably the middle class and thus have a broad base of political support At the same time they help the poor more than they help anyone else Why Mr Kuttner asks plausibly should the Democrats cut the very programs that bolster support for the welfare state the party is trying to strengthen and improve And yes all this will require new taxes He suggests a modified consumption tax but acknowledges that Democrats probably cant talk about it until after the election MR KUTTNER is at his best in excoriating those who would blame the worker first for Americas lack of economic competitiveness He points to case after case in which workers made deep wage and benefit concessions to employers only to see their companies taken over by a new crowd their sacrifices ignored Somebody who buys shares today and sells them tomorrow has legal control over a corporation  total control if she acquires 51 percent Mr Kuttner writes but a worker who has served the corporation loyally for twenty years has no legal standing whatsoever Mr Kuttner has a point when he says that the Democrats  like their social democratic counterparts in Western Europe  have a duty to articulate that workers sense of grievance He is also right when he says that Democrats believe that people are social beings not just individual consumers and that solidarity is a word Democrats should not be ashamed of But his analysis is weakened by his unbridled optimism about social democracy which is what his economic populism comes down to While he cites hopeful examples from European social democratic practice he largely ignores the fact that European social democracy is itself in deep crisis The triumph of rugged individualism and unfettered market economics is not just an American phenomenon and doubts about the welfare state have spread to even such solidly welfarist nations as Britain and Sweden For those of Mr Kuttners persuasion the crash of the Dow Jones averages may at least have the benefit of suggesting that those who believe in unfettered markets are no better at managing the economy than those who do not And on his central point Mr Kuttner is surely right the Democrats have been at their best when they have sought practical ways of giving voice to the aspirations and demands of the nonwealthy the people who live on paychecks and aspire to at least a modestly better shot in life for their children than they had themselves If the Democrats fail to to do this they will continue to lose elections And they will deserve to NO TIME FOR AUSTERITY It was two weeks after the stock market took a dive Robert Kuttner sat in his home in Brookline Mass his philosophical fist metaphorically raised in a gesture of defiant if premature victory A mixed economy never looked so good and laissez faire never looked so bad the 44yearold pundit said on the telephone I see the stock market crash as a real opportunity for the Democrats But sobriety soon returned to his manner The question is whether the Democrats will have the boldness to take this opportunity and run with it During the early 1980s Mr Kuttner edited Working Papers a nowdefunct centerleft journal he now writes for Business Week The Boston Globe and The New Republic He believes Democrats should remain true to their credo despite years of failure Im waiting for a Democrat to pick up the essence of Keynesian economics and say The last thing we need is austerity What we need now is expansionary politics If the Democrats argue austerity and belt tightening they lose Mr Kuttner has fierce opinions He likes the welfare state John Kenneth Galbraith deficits between 2 and 3 percent of the gross national product He dislikes neoliberals  and Republicans of course But he plays the wallflower when candidates come courting Im not so much in the business of telling the Democrats how to get elected as I am in the business of telling them how to rebuild the links between the party and the community RANDALL ROTHENBERG

SITTING OUT THE DANCE OF LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/books/sitting-out-the-dance-of-life.html,THE YEAR OF SILENCE By Madison Smartt Bell 194 pp New York Ticknor  Fields 1595 THE epigraph to Madison Smartt Bells fourth novel is the last sentence of Albert Camuss essay The Myth of Sisyphus Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux Sisyphus must be regarded as happy The essay addresses the problem of suicide and quickly becomes as it must a discussion of whether life has meaning Camus concludes that even the absurdist hero Sisyphus has the freedom to be happy However the problem of suicide remains an elusive one and for that reason we approach a novel about it with great interest Perhaps here we think we can begin to piece together bits of the puzzle Perhaps here we can discover the relationship between as Camus put it individual thought and suicide In Mr Bells new novel a young woman Marian kills herself by taking an overdose of pills The book is carefully constructed in the form of a triangle the first and last chapters take place on the first anniversary of Marians death the middle chapter is the vertex the only one written from Marians point of view and the one in which she dies The chapters in between work backward and forward in time to her suicide and through the year since her death It is a ballet really in which the characters graze one anothers lives sometimes connecting in a heartstopping flash of contact sometimes trying to connect yet sometimes not touching or speaking or even making eye contact Mr Bell captures vividly and poignantly that chancy dance of life from various points of view Marians lover Weber is described through the eyes of his friends Larkin and Sinclair Larkin is in New York to search for his missing brother Clarence the protagonist of Mr Bells earlier novel Waiting for the End of the World Weber hates his job teaching English in an innercity school yet he cannot abandon his students and after class instructs them in karate It is he who is most affected by Marians death and his anger and bewilderment are expressed in the two most tensionfilled sections when Larkin rescues him from his dangerous perch on the Williamsburg Bridge and when a stranger visits the karate class There are also Marians cousin and lifelong friend Gwen a dwarf called Jocko who hangs out near Marians apartment and has fallen in love with her some drugtaking acquaintances and several characters whom Marian doesnt know but whose paths happen to cross hers And finally Marian who carries a portfolio because she is an illustrator who has a round sometimes beautiful face surrounded by black hair who isnt afraid to gaze directly into peoples eyes who may be the dwarfs only friend who drinks beer with a shot of vodka who becomes thinner and more depressed as she undergoes her third abortion The enigmatic nervous girl about whom Weber says Oh Marian    I see you going down that lonesome road but who cannot connect with anyone even those who care for her and who ultimately cannot cope AS he has in his earlier work Mr Bell plumbs the depths of New York his characters are loners who live on its seamy underside Many take drugs are often out of control eat pickup meals sit mostly in bars and see the world as slimy There are many references to snakes and snakelike images Mr Bells city is not unlike Celines Paris and like Celine Mr Bell knows his city very well the greasy light the gray sky descending like the sole of somebodys shoe the ubiquity of suppressed and actual evil It is a bleak vision and by now a little too familiar We know those cops who find Marians body that old woman struggling with her walker that insecure guy who almost beats up his girlfriend and the drugdealing pair whose monologues are grating Although Mr Bell portrays the questioning the guilt the sense of betrayal and the peculiar exhilaration at being alive that can afflict those whose lives have been somehow connected to a suicide he doesnt tackle the problem of the suicide itself There is only one glimpse of the young Marian  as a mischievous firstgrader mesmerizing her parochial school class as she rolled up the absentminded sisters veil a leader the privileged kid who had it all But what happened We never know Though I watched the last hours of Marians life with a mounting sense of horror I really didnt know Marian well enough What interests Mr Bell is the possibility of violence that lurks under the surface of these lives Most of the time its easy enough to see yourself as being basically good one of his characters thinks But at other times in other moods youll find youve committed acts enough to construct a completely different person a regular evil bastard you could never bear to be    In the end theres no outrunning the terror of what you might be and of what you are Some of this violence is a response to Marians death but some is random And that is the books principal flaw Despite its careful structure The Year of Silence is not an organic whole in which the tension grows from the characters and their plight as it did in Mr Bells Straight Cut In this new novel the form seems superimposed on the characters making it read more like reportage than fiction As the book ends the most interesting characters  Weber Larkin and Sinclair  fade away and we are left wanting to know more about them Gwens memory of a card on which Marian had quoted Camus Le ver se trouve au coeur de lhomme Cest la quil faut le chercher The worm is in mans heart It is there that we must look for it  is disappointing So is Gwens sense of triumph that she has survived There is so much that could have been developed here yet Mr Bell stays on the surface though it is often a brilliantly conceived surface Still Madison Smartt Bell has a strong distinctive voice and writes as Rilke put it out of necessity At the age of 30 he has published five books of fiction He also has an uncanny understanding of the way many people must struggle to live Surely with time his novels will become deeper and even more complex ON THE EDGE WITH WEBER There was a three or fourfoot gap between the cable and the flat top of the tower which at ground level would have been easy enough to vault but up here it was a desperate clinging affair Larkin clawed his way over the edge keeping his head tucked in Below two policemen gripped him at the knee and hoisted Larkin lifted his eyes in a rash attempt to locate Weber and met again the fearful emptiness of midair Trembling he dropped his eyes to the gritty surface of the metal floor and slithered all the way over the top For a moment he lay at full length in a sort of pushup position and then he sat up crosslegged looking down at the space between his knees Well Tom decided to come out after all Weber said It is a nice day dont you think Freaking wonderful Larkin said He glanced up very briefly in the direction of the voice From The Year of Silence
"Vermont's Republican Party, Shaken by Losses, Adopts More Liberal Line",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/us/vermont-s-republican-party-shaken-by-losses-adopts-more-liberal-line.html,Vermonts Republican Party the colossus of state politics for more than a century but struggling in recent years is planning for a political comeback by recasting its image in a new more liberal light At its platform convention in Burlington last weekend the party backed some traditional Republican positions like a cut in the states personal income tax rate But it also took stands in favor of cleaning up Lake Champlain and increasing the availability of day care issues not usually associated with Republicans Republicans are often accused of always focusing on dollars and cents of being fiscally oriented and insensitive said Ralph Howe chairman of the Republican State Committee We believe that is untrue In this platform we are talking about the issues first in terms of human need Secondly we are offering solutions that are based on traditional Republican values  solving problems at the local level avoiding the creation of new bureaucracies 1986 Democratic Sweep The platform reflects new political alignments in a state that despite its conservative reputation has quietly become one of the most liberal in the country The need to do something different hit home last fall when Gov Madeleine M Kunin who is a Democrat won her second term and Senator Patrick J Leahy another Democrat won a huge reelection victory over Richard Snelling a former fourterm Republican Governor who had been out of office only two years The Democrats also took control of the 30member state Senate and reelected a Democrat as Speaker of the Vermont House despite a Republican majority in that chamber of the Legislature With the impending retirement of the states Republican Senator Robert T Stafford the party is left with only one proven statewide votegetter Representative James M Jeffords a liberal who votes frequently against the Reagan Administration and is anathema to the partys conservatives Mr Jeffords has announced that he will run for the vacant Senate seat in 1988 and is considered the leading contender As Maine Goes    The outcome of the 1986 elections would have been unthinkable as recently as the 1970s in a state dominated by the Republican Party since the Civil War The state voted for every Republican Presidential candidate until 1964 and in 1936 was joined only by Maine in voting for Alf Landon over Franklin D Roosevelt But in the absence of a viable Democratic Party the Republican Party encompassed a broad spectrum of political thinking including an isolationist conservative wing identified with Senator Robert A Taft of Ohio and a large moderate Eisenhower wing whose politics were epitomized by the late George Aiken who represented Vermont in the United States Senate from 1940 to 1975 The influence of the moderates was enhanced by the open primary system which allowed nonparty members to vote in Republican primaries As late as the 1950s 90 percent of Vermont voters voted in Republican primaries said Garrison Nelson a political scientist at the University of Vermont The conservatives hated the open primary system it meant that the more moderate Republicans would win the nomination and go to Washington Arrival of the Marpies The beginning of the Republican decline came in 1962 with the election of a Democratic Governor Philip Hoff a charismatic attorney from Burlington who defeated the incumbent Republican by less than 1500 votes Moderate and liberal Republicans became Democrats as the party became more viable Mr Nelson observed The native liberals started to move toward the Democrats These first stirrings of the Democratic Party coincided with the arrival in Vermont of large numbers of newcomers who dramatically changed the political geography Between 1970 and 1980 the population of Vermont grew by 66724 an increase of 15 percent The new arrivals Mr Nelson said were Marpies  Middle Aged Rural Professionals They were the white liberals who were confronting racial tension in the cities Mr Nelson said They chose to remove themselves from that tension by moving to Vermont So they came up here with their copies of Vermont Life  and it looked just like that Pretty soon you couldnt tell them from the natives The Independent Factor The new Vermonters signed on as Democrats or more commonly as independentminded voters without party affiliation Today nearly half of Vermonts 328000 registered voters are independents up from 30 percent in the 1960s The independent vote is the key to Vermont politics said Richard Dresner a New York pollster who works in the state They vote for candidates and issues not for parties They are fiscally conservative and moderate to liberal on social issues Representative Jeffords has been a beneficiary of the independent vote since he first ran for the House in 1974 he regularly has won more than 80 percent of the vote much of it from the independents If you dont have a united party behind a candidate who can attract the independents you cant win said Mr Jeffords I am the direct heir of the Aiken wing My hallmark has been that I attract the independent voter Jeffords and the Conservatives His popularity has enraged conservative Republicans like John McClaughry a former Reagan aide who considers Mr Jeffords disloyal Jeffords should give back the money he has raised for his Senate race from Republicans and run as a Democrat candidate for the US Senate Mr McClaughry said after Mr Jeffords voted with House Democrats earlier this month for a Federal deficitreduction package that Republicans opposed The plan was approved by one vote But the party in general was unexpectedly and noticeably silent on the matter at the platform convention and Mr Howe when asked later whether Mr Jeffords should resign the party said no In the past we have been quick to jump on what we perceived as errant behavior said Mr Howe What we need to be about is telling people what were for Beginning to Wake Up Mr Jeffords said he is pleased by the partys new face This is a better platform than we have seen in the past he said In the past weve gotten into emotional divisive issues like abortion and school prayer that do not appeal to the mainstream Mr Nelson attributed the softened Republican stance to the 1986 SnellingLeahy contest in which Mr Leahy took 64 percent of the vote to Mr Snellings 34 percent 1986 will go down in Vermont history as its single most important election he predicted The Democrats took over everything It ended the career of Dick Snelling the most important Republican figure of the last 20 years The dimension of the Snelling defeat had to have struck horror into their hearts Its taken them a long while to smell the coffee but theres evidence theyre beginning to wake up
"With the Kennedy Nomination, The Center Holds",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/weekinreview/with-the-kennedy-nomination-the-center-holds.html,THERE was none of the usual suspense or drama to President Reagans announcement on Wednesday that Judge Anthony M Kennedy was his latest choice for the Supreme Court The Federal appeals court judge from California the runnerup only two weeks earlier to Judge Douglas H Ginsburg had become the allbutofficial choice in the four days since revelations about marijuana use forced Judge Ginsburgs withdrawal With Congress and the rest of official Washington shut for Veterans Day Mr Reagans deliberately lowkey presentation of his third nominee for the Court vacancy had the appearance of an anticlimax But this was a truly startling event one that beyond its obvious significance for the Supreme Court was painfully revealing of the status of Ronald Reagan and of the conservative revolution he came to Washington to lead Almost seven years to the day after Mr Reagan first won the Presidency running on a platform that included reversing the direction of the Supreme Court he was forced by political reality to turn to a nominee whose judicial career offers not a hint of revolutionary fervor Mr Reagan has appointed 324 judges to the Federal district and appeals courts including both Judge Ginsburg and Judge Robert H Bork his first choice It was telling that when he finally realized he needed a consensus nominee he looked beyond his own appointees to a man who was named to the appeals court by Gerald R Ford a President who never made the Court an issue and whose one Supreme Court nominee John Paul Stevens is a moderate who has perhaps the least predictable voting record of all the current Justices The 51yearold Judge Kennedy little known to the general public is a popular and respected member of the judicial establishment a kind of judges judge Those who know him say he fits the mold of the retired Justice he would replace Lewis F Powell Jr in contrast to Judge Bork the ideological crusader whom the Senate rejected last month by a vote of 58 to 42 the biggest margin of defeat for any High Court nominee In fact the path Mr Reagan has followed in his effort to fill Justice Powells seat is a kind of metaphor for the evolution of his Presidency He has been forced to modify if not jettison not only his agenda for the Court but also many of the core positions that defined his unique political personality his reliance on supplyside economics to erase the Federal deficit his characterization of the Soviet Union as the evil empire his commitment to social policy goals including banning abortion and restoring prayer in schools These were extreme positions that despite two landslide elections simply never made much headway in a nonextreme society Statisticians and social scientists use a concept called regression to the mean to explain why extraordinary events tend to be followed by the more ordinary  why extremely tall parents often have averagesized children for example or even why great movies tend to have mediocre sequels In a way the concept fits the Reagan Administration as well Drift Toward Compromise While conservatives have been complaining for some time about the inexorable drift toward compromise the Supreme Court battle crystalized their anger as no other loss has done Early in the week as word spread that Judge Kennedys nomination was inevitable many remained almost disbelieving For them Mr Reagans announcement along with his concession that the experience of the last several months has made us all a little bit wiser signified a world turned upside down The sense of fruition many conservatives felt with the Bork nomination in the early days of summer turned to bitterness as they watched the third and presumably final chapter unfold in a freak nearblizzard on Veterans Day Its just amazing to contemplate said Michael P McDonald an official of the Washington Legal Foundation a nerve center for conservative Washington lawyers We were so close to locking in a conservative majority on the Court into the next century Now he said given the likelihood the next President will have a number of vacancies to fill a Democratic President could be in a position to accomplish the opposite The Kennedy nomination is also for many conservatives a symbol of Mr Reagans failure to translate his election victories into significant change There has been no institutional change whatsoever said Gordon S Jones a vice president of the Heritage Foundation a once tiny conservative research group that achieved prominence in the early Reagan years He listed a series of discouraging developments from new regulatory initiatives to the Presidents endorsement last week of a new Cabinet department for veterans The effort to seat a Justice also opened embarrassing fissures within the Reagan coalition White House chief of staff Howard H Baker Jr who all along had advocated a nonconfrontational approach was denounced until virtually the last minute as a compromiser of principle by those who think themselves true believers Nearly lost in the polemics was Judge Kennedy himself That was ironic because in many ways this former smallcity lawyer with the stable marriage and three attractive children and the fine reputation appears to personify just those values that made the image of Ronald Reagan so attractive after the convulsions of the 1960s and 1970s It is a measure of how muddled political discourse has become that those around the President and he himself were so slow to recognize that these values could be the legacy he might most wish to leave
NORTHERN DEMOCRATS ASSESS GAINS IN ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/nyregion/northern-democrats-assess-gains-in-election.html,LEAD AMAZING as it seems we won the election AMAZING as it seems we won the election For nearly two weeks now those have been the first words to greet callers who reach the answering machine in Patricia V Hotchkisss Bedford Hills home And while the voice belongs to Mrs Hotchkiss the sentiment is shared by many in the northern part of the county To the surprise of even some within her own party Mrs Hotchkiss a Democrat defeated Ursula G LaMotte an incumbent Republican for the Second District seat on the Board of Legislators Unofficial election results show that Mrs Hotchkiss received 6151 votes and Mrs LaMotte 5604 votes Mrs LaMotte had been given the advantage by most political observers first because of her incumbency and then because in the district which includes Bedford Mount Kisco New Castle and parts of Cortlandt and Ossining Republicans outnumber Democrats 10362 to 8645 There are an additional 7345 registered voters with no party affiliation Both women had been members of the Bedford Town Board but last May Mrs LaMotte who was also the towns deputy supervisor was appointed to the County Board replacing Robert D Hazzard who resigned to devote more time to his law practice The appointment had angered some supporters of Lawrence E Dwyer Jr Bedfords popular Republican Town Supervisor for the post and there have been suggestions that Mrs Hotchkiss gained from the resulting disaffection Mrs Hotchkiss cited voter resentment of the maneuvers of a downcounty party machine as a factor in her election Others believe Mrs Hotchkiss was greatly aided by a lastminute campaign by some who portrayed Mrs LaMotte as an opponent of legalized abortion Mrs LaMotte acknowledged that the misrepresentation of her view contributed to her defeat Whatever the reasons Democratic leaders said Mrs Hotchkisss victory would help their efforts to reestablish their party in Westchesters traditionally Republican northern tier Theres no question that she will help said Richard L Weingarten the County Democratic Party chairman Shes clearly a northcounty person Referring to the attention that Sandra R Galef the Boards Democratic minority leader brings the party in the Ninth Legislative District which includes parts of Greenburgh Mount Pleasant and Ossining Mr Weingarten said Im sure Pattys going to do the same thing I think Patty Hotchkisss win has to be the biggest thing not only for northern Westchester Democrats but for county Democrats as a whole said Bill Smith chairman of the Pound Ridge Democratic Party It makes us feel that somewhere we can put it together and beat Republicans in their stronghold Mr Smith who said he revitalized the towns dormant Democratic Party only last June discussed gains made in a municipality where there are 1151 registered Republicans and only 692 registered Democrats Nancy J Woolley a Democrat was not only elected to the Town Board but also was the leading vote getter and Paul L Kohnstamm the Democratic candidate for supervisor lost to James Trippe the Republican and Conservative Party candidate by only 53 votes Two years ago the Democrats had no slate Before this Democrats in the town were fatalisticnihilistic Mr Smith said They felt there was no sense running or even voting However he said that the local victories coupled with Mrs Hotchkisss election has shown them that we can run people who can get elected Meanwhile in neighboring Lewisboro as well as in Somers the Democrats also ran slates  they had none in 1985 No candidates were elected but the effort demonstrated a further local resurgence of the party Just by running I think we won said Margaret E Rush chairwoman of the Somers Democratic Party and a candidate for the Town Board Im darn proud of what we did Mrs Rush like others interviewed predicted that the Democrats would make a stronger showing in two years I think the solid north is starting to crack said Walter I Seligsohn chairman of the Democratic Party in Cortlandt where an upset was scored when two of its candidates were elected to the Town Board Mr Seligsohn said that those victories showed that ours is not a hopeless cause He also noted that because the Second District includes part of Cortlandt Mrs Hotchkisss success would be felt even more However Mr Seligsohn said it would be particularly important for Democrats in northern Westchester towns to act quickly on the strength of their gains to soldify party organization and recruit new members But the Republicans also have accomplishments to boast about including the victory in North Salem Robert J Spinna registered over Lois Q Lippmann the incumbent Supervisor in northern Westchesters one traditional Democratic oasis Mr Smith said he fully expected Republicans in Pound Ridge and other towns to regroup so as to better meet a potential Democratic resurgence Still Mrs Hotchkiss and possible spillover from her election  remains the most immediate Republican problem in northern Westchester I see Patty Hotchkiss getting a new press that traditionally had not been given to Democrats in northern Westchester Mr Dwyer said And I see that as a major inroad into the strength of the Republican Party When you get recognition for another stand that creates twoparty government But I think Patty will tend to get attention more on the basis of issues than party politics She tends to be very independent Although Mrs Hotchkiss will be presenting views contrary to those of the Republicans Mr Dwyer said that isnt necessarily a bad thing Most political observers expect a particularly intense effort by the countys Republican Party to limit Mrs Hotchkiss to one term Should Mrs Hotchkiss choose to run again in 1989 she will be the one enjoying the advantage of incumbency That may pose an interesting problem for the Republican leadership On one hand the Republicans could turn to Mrs LaMotte for a rematch But Mrs Hotchkiss would as an office holder have the advantage of voter recognition Reportedly Mrs LaMotte will be offered a political appointment that should she choose to take it would give her continued visibility in anticipation of another race There are many who believe that Mr Dwyer could be asked to run Political observers say he might prove a much stronger candidate even though those close to the Republican Party say that he is not favored by either Anthony J Colavita chairman of both the county and the state Republican Parties or Edward J Brady Chairman of the County Board These same sources say that neither man wanted Mr Dwyer because he was considered a loose cannon who would not necessarily adhere to party discipline While not directly commenting on his relationship with the Republican leadership Mr Dwyer said that if my outspokenness made me an uncertainty then Im very proud to be an uncertainty I dont think I made any mistakes by standing up and saying what I thought he continued But I have never challenged the socalled Republican bosses unless Ive felt it was best for my own constituency While he does not deny that he was once interested in serving on the County Board or that he is very anxious to go forward in politics Mr Dwyer said that at this time I have no desire and no interest in running for the County Legislature Mr Dwyer who ran unopposed this year for his third term as Town Supervisor said that when the time came he would see whats out there I dont know if what Im looking for is County Legislator he added Associates of Mr Dwyer said that he was really seeking to become County Executive and that he felt that he might develop a stronger base for that position as a town supervisor with an accomplished administrative record They noted that among the Democrats James P Doody who just scored his third impressive victory as Town Supervisor in Eastchester once a Republican bastion appeared to be following a similar strategy That could be why Mr Dwyer who has run before for Supervisor with the Democratic endorsement supposedly turned down an early offer to run as that partys candidate for the Second District seat In any event he has been active in trying to bring together many of the towns in the north of Westchester around common issues By not running against Mrs Hotchkiss he could be trying to cultivate a bipartisan constituency He speaks highly of both Mrs Hotchkiss and Mrs LaMotte Mr Weingarten however is less concerned about Mr Dwyers ambitions than about capitalizing on Mrs Hotchkisss success even though he conceded that it might take some time to make another impressive gain in the northern part of the county There are indications that while Mr Weingarten may not believe that Mr Brady and John E Hand the Republican majority leader who represents the Fourth District can be defeated he believes the Democrats might be able to take the seats when the two step down provided there are some strong town Democratic committees in place It may not happen while Im chairman but it will happen Mr Weingarten said speaking of the possibility of a solid Democratic political presence in the northern part of the county I may be like Moses who led people to the Promised Land was able to see it but wasnt allowed to enter it himself
JUDGE KENNEDY: TILTING RIGHT BUT NOT FAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/us/judge-kennedy-tilting-right-but-not-far.html,Judge Anthony M Kennedy could slightly shift the balance of the Supreme Court on criminal law and perhaps some civil rights issues a review of several of his decisions suggests But little can be determined about his views on key issues including abortion affirmative action and churchstate relations When Justice Lewis F Powell Jr resigned from the Court President Reagan and his conservative supporters had hoped to use the vacancy to move the Court to the right on these and other issues in which the centrist Justice Powell often supplied the fifth vote for liberal majorities But the record of Judge Kennedy a compromise nominee selected after the defeat of Judge Robert H Bork and the withdrawal of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg provides no clear evidence that he would differ on these issues from Justice Powell At the same time it offers no clear evidence that he would not To the Right of Center Some of Judge Kennedys opinions in his 12 years as a Federal appeals court judge in Sacramento suggest that he is willing to uphold death sentences and other tough penalties when no procedural errors have been made He seems reluctant to strike down criminal convictions on technical grounds but willing to do so when real police misconduct is involved His opinions also indicate that he is skeptical of novel or speculative discrimination suits can be receptive to free press and free speech claims and is sensitive to the danger of Congressional encroachment on executive and judicial powers But he is less clearly an advocate of a strong executive than Judge Bork Judge Kennedy is generally placed well to the right of center on the 26judge Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit but not at the far right However he has been so balanced and cautious that it is difficult to predict how he would resolve many of the politically charged issues facing the Court Apprehension and Hope In his weekly radio address today President Reagan urged the Senate to quickly confirm Judge Kennedy whom he said has won bipartisan praise Based on preliminary study of Judge Kennedys 400 judicial opinions both conservative and liberal legal experts and others express a mix of apprehension and hope as to whether he will end up on their side of issues For example while there was praise among liberals for what Prof Laurence H Tribe of the Harvard Law School called the spirit of decency and moderation civil rights groups have faulted some rulings and questioned his sensitivity to discrimination cases They cite among others a 1976 opinion dismissing a housing discrimination suit which the Supreme Court later overruled 7 to 2 in an opinion by Justice Powell The latest nominees judicial style especially his penchant for narrowly drafted opinions carefully anchored to precedent has been likened by some experts to that of Justice Powell and by others to that of Justice Sandra Day OConnor and the former Justice Potter Stewart all three pragmatic centrists who usually but not always leaned to the right This stylistic similarity does not necessarily mean Judge Kennedy would vote the way Justice Powell did all or even most of the time Those who predict he would do so and thus leave the Courts ideological balance largely unchanged or shift it only slightly to the conservative side include Bruce Fein an adjunct scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation Mr Fein acknowledged that such predictions involve a large degree of speculation and extrapolation from decisions by Judge Kennedy that did not directly discuss the most important issues facing the Supreme Court In addition Judge Kennedys views may evolve in unpredictable directions once he is confirmed Notwithstanding these uncertainties Mr Fein said Judge Kennedys opinions on the death penalty and in some other criminal cases suggest he will move the Court in a more conservative direction although perhaps not dramatically on those issues A Firm Call For Restraint Unlike Judge Bork Judge Kennedy has made few broad pronouncements on judicial philosophy and his opinions tend to be short to the point and grounded on Supreme Court precedents rather than philosophical principles But he did touch on the fundamental role of the courts in enforcing the openended clauses of the Constitution in a panel discussion last August at the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference in Hawaii In calling for judges to be restrained in exercising judicial review Judge Kennedy struck a theme often sounded by Judge Bork Judicial power without rational restraints is simply the exercise of raw will the arrogance of power abuse of office he said He added rather cryptically that there must be some demonstrated historical link between the rule being advanced in court and the announced declarations and language of the framers But unlike Judge Bork and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d he stopped well short of suggesting that constitutional problems could be solved by strict adherence to the original intent of the framers or any other formulaic approach And unlike them he made no suggestion that the Supreme Court had broadly usurped the powers of elected officials in recent decades Criminal Law Close to Powell Judge Kennedy was touted by President Reagan on Wednesday as tough but fair on criminal law The comments of both prosecutors and defense lawyers who have appeared before him and the nominees dozens of written opinions on criminal law issues support the description On criminal law and death penalty issues the Supreme Court has been moving for more than a decade in a generally conservative direction that favors law enforcement Justice Powell was usually in the majority Although few experts expect Judge Kennedys confirmation to lead to dramatic changes several predicted he would be marginally more likely than Justice Powell to side with prosecutors on some closely contested issues Judge Kennedy has shown no reluctance to uphold procedurally correct death sentences Earlier this year for example in Neuschafer v Whitley he wrote an opinion for a threejudge panel upholding the death penalty for a Nevada man who strangled a fellow inmate while serving a life sentence for raping and murdering two young women But in 1986 in Vickers v Ricketts Judge Kennedy wrote an opinion for a different threejudge panel holding that Supreme Court precedent required overturning the death sentence of another prisoner who killed his cell mate because the trial judge had not instructed the jury properly Judge Kennedy has repeatedly criticized rigid restrictions on police searches and seizures and has called for relaxing the exclusionary rule which courts have used to bar evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment In a 1983 case United States v Harvey Judge Kennedy dissented from a decision to bar the results of a blood alcohol test on technical grounds As a result an involuntary manslaughter conviction was reversed He said If the exclusionary rule becomes an end in itself and courts do not apply it in a sensible and predictable way then one approach is to reexamine it altogether While noting that only the Supreme Court had the authority to do that he said the rule should not be applied in the Harvey case because the police had acted reasonably and in good faith Justice Powell joined in several Supreme Court decisions limiting use of the exclusionary rule to situations in which it was likely to deter police misconduct and in scaling back earlier decisions that had expanded defendants rights under the Fourth Amendment It is far from clear however that Judge Kennedy would vote to abandon use of the exclusionary rule In United States v Penn in 1980 he argued emphatically in dissent for barring the use as evidence of heroin that Federal agents had obtained by paying a 5 bribe to a 5yearold boy to inform against his mother Assailing this disruption of the constitutionally protected parentchild union he said I view the police practice here as both pernicious in itself and dangerous as precedent Question Mark On Abortion Much of the opposition to Judge Borks nomination was based on his sweeping denunciations of Supreme Court decisions that recognized a vaguely defined right to sexual privacy including the rights to use contraception and to have abortions in the early months of pregnancy President Reagan has long sought to overturn the Courts abortion rights decisions Moreover four of the Courts eight current members have indicated a desire to narrow the protection of abortion and rights to sexual privacy Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Justice Byron R White have stated explicitly that they would overrule Roe v Wade the 1973 decision legalizing abortion Judge Kennedys vote could thus be decisive on such issues So far much speculation over Judge Kennedys views has centered on his 1980 decision in Beller v Middendorf which upheld the constitutionality of Navy regulations providing for dismissal of enlisted persons who engage in homosexual acts Ruling for a threejudge panel he cited the special need for discipline and order in the service the Navys concern that tolerance of homosexual conduct might hurt recruiting and morale and other factors including moral precepts recognized by many in our society as legitimate These factors he said outweighed any constitutional protection of homosexual conduct But Judge Kennedys opinion contrasted with Judge Borks broad assertion in a similar Navy case that the Constitution provides no protection whatever for such conduct Unlike Judge Bork Judge Kennedy noted that some Supreme Court precedents could arguably be deemed to suggest that some kinds of governmental regulation of private consensual homosexual behavior may face substantial constitutional challenge He also went out of his way to assert that upholding the challenged regulations as constitutional is distinct from a statement that they are wise In addition Judge Kennedy cited with no hint of disapproval the series of Supreme Court decisions protecting some aspects of sexual privacy including the right to have an abortion Nonetheless the question of what Judge Kennedy would do about these issues on the Supreme Court is still wide open Rights Rulings Raise Concern Although Judge Kennedy has ruled both for and against civil rights plaintiffs in discrimination suits some civil rights and liberal groups have faulted what some see as a pattern of not favoring such claims But the muted concerns voiced by these groups been far more subdued than the outcry against the Bork nomination Judge Kennedys supporters say that there are no grounds for concern about his civil rights record which some liken to Justice Powells So far the civil rights criticisms have focused on five decisions They include AFSCME v Washington in 1985 in which Judge Kennedy wrote the nations first major appellate decision on whether Federal sexdiscrimination law requires equal pay for women doing jobs that are not identical but are of comparable worth to higherpaid job categories dominated by men Judge Kennedys opinion overturned a decision by a Federal district judge that could have provided as much as 1 billion to 15500 Washington State employees He ruled that no state liability was established by a 1974 study showing that state workers in jobs dominated by men were paid 20 percent more than those in jobs that involved equivalent skills responsibilities and working conditions held mainly by women Holding that the state did not create the market disparity and had no proven intent to pay women less than men Judge Kennedy said that neither law nor logic deems the free market system a suspect enterprise The decision has been criticized by feminist groups government employee unions and others who say that Judge Kennedy took liberties with the factual record compiled by the trial court The judges supporters deny this however and even some liberal lobbyists concede that the comparable worth theory that he rejected has not yet won wide acceptance by courts The case in which Judge Kennedys opinion was later overruled in a 7to2 Supreme Court decision was Topic v Circle Realty a 1976 ruling protecting real estate agents who steer customers to onerace neighborhoods from some private lawsuits Judge Kennedy held that an organization of black and white couples who had posed as home seekers for purposes of detecting racial steering had no standing to sue the real estate agents under the Federal Fair Housing Act Only direct victims of this practice such as black couples genuinely seeking homes would have standing he said In 1979 Justice Powell rejected this logic in a similar case Another Kennedy decision that civil rights groups have criticized is Spangler v Pasadena in 1979 He said in a concurring opinion that there was no constitutional obligation to provide a particular racial mix in schools and that once Federal courts in school desegregation cases had dismantled past official segregation they should end their jurisdiction He suggested this would allow the school district to adopt a neighorhood schools approach even if it would lead to resegregation of the schools But Judge Kennedy has also ruled in favor of civil rights plaintiffs in a number of cases One example is Flores v Pierce in 1980 in which his opinion upheld an award of 48500 in damages to two MexicanAmericans based on evidence that racially motivated officials of Calistoga Calif delayed issuing a liquor license for their restaurant Receptive View Of Free Speech Judge Kennedy like Justice Powell has generally been receptive to First Amendment free press and free speech claims in the handful of such cases that have come before him In Goldblum v National Broadcasting Corporaton in 1978 his opinion for a threejudge panel granted emergency relief to the network in a suit filed by a man involved in a major securities and insurance fraud scandal who sought to block the broadcast of a partly fictionalized television show about it The trial judge had ordered NBC to submit the film so he could review it for inaccuracies before the scheduled broadcast The network refused Upholding the networks position Judge Kennedy said the order was a threatened interference with the editorial process and that an injunction would be a sweeping prior restraint of speech and therefore presumptively unconstitutional In CBS Inc v United States District Court in 1985 Judge Kennedys opinion for a unanimous threejudge panel ordered a trial judge to allow CBS to see sealed documents filed with the court in connection with the reduction of a defendants sentence in a highly publicized narcotics case Rejecting arguments by the prosecution and the defendant for secrecy Judge Kennedy emphasized that public examination study and comment is essential if the corrections process is to improve Judge Kennedy also wrote an opinion upholding a lower courts dismissal of a slander suit by a Germanborn woman against the Mayor of Santa Monica Calif who had compared her to a Nazi war criminal with the same name While deploring this vicious slur Judge Kennedy found it was a constitutionally protected statement of opinion because no reasonable listener would think that the plaintiff was in fact the Nazi war criminal In some instances speech must seek its own refutation without intervention by the courts he said In this case if the mayor chose to get in the gutter the law simply leaves her there Balancing The Powers Perhaps Judge Kennedys most important ruling was his 1980 decision striking down the legislative veto a device by which Congress sought to revoke decisions by Federal agencies and officials by means short of new legislation The Supreme Court affirmed his ruling in 1983 and in the process swept from the law books legislative veto provisions in hundreds of laws more Federal laws than the Court had overturned in its entire previous history The case Chadha v Immigration and Naturalization Service was a challenge by an alien who faced deportation under a provision of the immigration laws that permitted either House of Congress by a majority vote to rescind decisions by the Attorney General to suspend deportation of certain aliens
"WASHINGTON TALK: CONGRESS; Taft? Hartley? The Names Ring a Bell, but Why?",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/washington-talk-congress-taft-hartley-the-names-ring-a-bell-but-why.html,Anybody remember Representative Fred A Hartley Jr A New Jersey Republican with 20 years in the House who was briefly chairman of the Education and Labor Committee Wait a minute wasnt he Hartley of the TaftHartley Act the restrictive 1947 labor law that the unions bitterly fought and are still mad about Right he was that Hartley which puts him in the small corps of lawmakers who have escaped obscurity by leaving their names on famous statutes Even his cosponsor Senator Robert A Taft of Ohio may be better remembered today for that labor law than for his considerable Senate leadership or his persistent though unsuccessful attempts to win the Republican Presidential nomination 40 years ago Ever since Jenkins Hill came to be known as Capitol Hill people up there have been wondering how is it that some Senators and Representatives have their names immortalized on legislation while others often more prominent do not Why do some acts of Congress preserve their sponsors names while others carry only dull forgettable titles How can a shrewd legislator improve his or her chances for such a footnote in history How Its Done Old Congressional hands provide a few guidelines Sometimes as in the TaftHartley Act of 1947 a major party policy bill will be sponsored by the chairmen of the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over the bills subject But look at KempRoth the tax cut proposal of 1981 Senator William V Roth Jr of Delaware was only the thirdranking Republican on the Finance Committee and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York wasnt a member of the Ways and Means Committee at all Most frequently a bill carries two names one Senator and one Representative in that order But see KempRoth in reverse order above Also see GrammRudmanHollings the deficitreducing proposal with three names all Senators Phil Gramm of Texas Warren B Rudman of New Hampshire and Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina And consider among historic onename statues the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 Senator John Sherman of Ohio and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 Representative Henry De Lamar Clayton of Alabama who had left Congress for the Federal bench by the time his proposal became law Failure Can Breed Fame A resourceful legislator may even achieve undiluted fame with something less than a law like an amendment to a bill or an amendment to the Constitution that almost always identifies only one sponsor Witness the Hyde Amendment to limit Federal spending for abortions Representative Henry J Hyde of Illinois the Boland Amendment to prohibit financial support for the Nicaraguan rebels Representative Edward P Boland of Massachusetts and the Gephardt Amendment to try to correct international trade imbalances Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri All three are household words on Capitol Hill these days Generally an amendment loses its identification with its author and thus its publicity value after it is adopted and absorbed in a bill But if it is defeated and then repeatedly resubmitted on the floor the sponsors name becomes recognizable shorthand for the proposal sometimes even for the cause as in the case of Mr Hyde Occasionally a disputed amendment usually constitutional rather than statutory remains memorable after its backer passes into history the Bricker Amendment to limit Presidential power to enter into international agreements Senator John W Bricker of Ohio and the Dirksen Amendment to permit prayer in the public schools Senator Everett M Dirksen of Illinois SmootHawley Redivivus The current debate over the Gephardt Amendment has revived the faded familiarity of a landmark trade bill the SmootHawley Tariff Act of 1930 and its sponsors Senator Reed Smoot of Utah and Representative Willis C Hawley of Oregon Representative Kemp of the KempRoth bill in his Presidential campaign speeches likes to predict that the Gephardt Amendment would bring back the grim protectionist days of SmootHawley Some in his audiences nod agreement others just nod Richard A Baker the Senate historian said he did not know of any Congressional scholar who has analyzed how bills are named He speculated that some laws identified with their sponsors have been technical in character named after authors who were specialists in the field He cited the PriceAnderson Act of 1954 dealing with atomic energy Both sponsors Senator Clinton P Anderson of New Mexico and Representatively Melvin Price of Illinois were members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy but as Democrats in the last Republicancontrolled Congress they had limited political standing Stephen H Hess a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies Congress suggested that some laws like TaftHartley memorialize political godfathers ranking lawmakers with strong party motivation whose identification is reinforced when opponents of the law attack it using their names for years thereafter Laying a Foundation On the other hand Mr Hess observed the sponsors of BradleyGephardt might better be classed as intellectual godfathers of the tax simplification bill that emerged from Congress in 1986 Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and the ubiquitous Representative Gephardt were not major figures on their respective taxwriting committees but their proposal helped lay the foundation for the final legislation Prof Steven Smith a political scientist at the University of Minnesota said that the use of sponsors names adds color and flavor to legislative history for the lawyers and academics who will cite the law in the future and gives members of Congress a sense of identity and achievement they might otherwise lack He said the BradleyGephardt bill although it never had any prospect of adoption intact contributed to Presidential status for its authors something Mr Bradley is now avoiding and Mr Gephardt is doggedly pursuing Giving an act of Congress a memorable nickname isnt easy Professor Smith said When a bill has many sponsors or when the subject is one that nobody particularly wants to be identified with like tax increases the measure is likely to wind up as something like the Guaranteed Deficit Reduction Act of 1987 accurate but not exactly catchy A Bill of Two Names Most Federal legislation in fact is not identified by author but by a general title like the Civil Rights Acts the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the War Powers Act or the Endangered Species Act On rare occasions a major proposal comes to be known by both a title and its sponsors names The Full Employment Act of 1978 is as frequently called the HumphreyHawkins Act after Senator Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota and Representative Augustus F Hawkins of California In earlier Congresses onename laws were much more common Examples include the Tillman Act of 1907 prohibiting political contributions by banks Senator Benjamin R Tillman of South Carolina the Mann Act of 1910 barring interstate transportation of women for immoral purposes Representative James R Mann of Illinois the Wagner Act of 1935 establishing the National Labor Relations Board Senator Robert F Wagner of New York the Hatch Act of 1939 restricting political activity by government employees Senator Carl A Hatch of New Mexico and the Smith Act of 1940 making it illegal to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government Representative Howard W Smith of Virginia
Topics of The Times; Cruelty in the Name of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/20/opinion/topics-of-the-times-cruelty-in-the-name-of-life.html,Several years ago having listened hard to Americas righttolifers the Reagan Administration found a way to throw them a bone The Agency for International Development would not renew its contract with Planned Parenthood unless the birth control agency pledged not to help any overseas programs that also offer abortion services Never mind that Planned Parenthood has at no time used grants for abortion programs in this country Or that this and similar Administration initiatives added up to an abandonment of Americas long commitment to helping poor nations control population growth Planned Parenthood refused to sign the pledge and now it has issued a report that makes clear the folly and cruelty of the Reagan policy The aid cutoff would take effect Jan 1 and deprive 14 million people in 41 countries of help with family planning According to researchers at the Universty of Michigan that could lead to 311000 additional live births 69000 selfinduced abortions and 1200 more maternal deaths over the next three years Unless the Administration changes its mind about the proposed cutoff those Americans who lobbied so hard for it may eventually claim a victory But the victory wont be over the promoters of abortion so despised by the righttolifers It will be instead over the worlds poorest women living in the worlds poorest countries Only the meanest spirit could find satisfaction in denying them Americas help
Organized Groups Flock to Iowa Trying to Gain Influence in '88 Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/21/us/organized-groups-flock-to-iowa-trying-to-gain-influence-in-88-campaign.html,Organized groups representing causes ranging from the unborn to the elderly are more involved than ever in trying to influence the Presidential campaigns in Iowa Many of the groups are national organizations that say that they have recognized in the Iowa caucuses a chance to get more attention for their issues than they could by staying home in Washington There are certainly more groups said Hugh Winebrenner a professor at Duke University who is an expert on Iowas Presidential caucuses the first real test of support for the 1988 Presidential candidates They seem to think this is a unique opportunity to gain access to the process Unions womens organizations peace groups antiabortion leagues farmers associations and a multitude of other groups are trying to organize their members to attend the caucuses on Feb 8 and to inject issues of importance to them into the debate over nominating the Presidential candidates This is the first time that Right to Life has ever tried to have an impact on the caucuses said Sarah Leslie president of the Iowa chapter of the National Right to Life Commitee We see Iowa as critical in 1988 Robert P Canavan of the American Association of Retired Persons said This is the first time weve gotten involved in caucus activities No Endorsement Yet Neither Right to Life nor the AARP is endorsing a candidate But both are using videotapes and workshops to train their members on how to participate in the caucuses Both are also arming their members with detailed information to question candidates and to press for passage of resolutions at the cacuses The AARP sponsored a forum for Democratic candidates Thursday This morning the group sponsored another that was attended by two Republican candidates Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and former Gov Pete du Pont of Delaware The candidates were presented with the associations positions on health care and income security for the elderly Were telling the candidates If youre right on the issues you have a shot at getting their support  Mr Canavan said of the associations 300000 members in Iowa The increased involvement of groups seeking to press specific issues has been noticed by many politicians A few have criticized the development saying these groups tend to set up litmus tests on narrow issues that every candidate must pass or risk losing crucial support in a competitive race One group Stop the Arms Race a political action committee has been pressing each Democratic candidate on several issues including whether each will halt flight testing of intercontinental missiles If it takes a passing grade on every one of StarPacs tests Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee a Democratic Presidential contender said of the groups tactics a candidate like John Kennedy or Harry Truman or Franklin Roosevelt could never win the Iowa caucuses Senator Gore recently curtailed his campaigning in Iowa Other campaigns recognize the growing activity of these groups but are less critical or even welcome it Thats what its all about being pushed said another Democrat Bruce Babbitt former Governor of Arizona The question is what do you do about it when youre pushed At todays forum Mr Kemp thanked the AARP for pressing the issues of health care and income security into the race Scott Reed Mr Kemps Iowa campaign manager said the activities of groups such as the Right to Life Committee and the AARP provided an effective and inexpensive vehicle for Mr Kemp to reach voters and counteract the visibility of his better known opponents Vice President Bush and Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate minority leader Bigger Turnout Is Possible One likely effect of the increased activity of organized groups politicians say will probably be to increase the turnout at the caucuses of both parties which in 1984 drew a little more than 100000 participants But whom this increased turnout will help or hurt is far from clear as is the larger impact of the organizations Whether theyre having more influence or canceling each other out I cant say said Professor Winebrenner On the abortion issue for example all the Republicans are in the ranks of the antiabortionists on the Democratic side where groups favoring a womens right to choose whether to have an abortion have been active all six candidates support that position Many of the organized groups plan to continue their activities through the remainder of the Presidential nominating process The AARP has been sponsoring television advertisments urging senior citizens to participate both here and in New Hampshire which holds its primary a week after the Iowa caucuses But there is general agreement that the Iowa caucuses offer such groups an unusual opportunity This is partly because they are first and partly because of the special nature of Iowa campaiging with candidates being far more accessible than they will be later In addition the caucuses place a special emphasis on organization You can have all the people in the world for you said Mr Reed of the Kemp campaign The real question is how many will go out on that snowy night to the caucuses

that  the Dukakis campaign This skit was not exactly a thighslapper but it did have a political barb the campaign of Gov Michael S Dukakis was the source of an attack video showing that Senator Joseph R Biden Jr had stolen the words  indeed the entire family background  of a British labor leader which led to the demise of the Biden candidacy on the rocks of the character issue We will be hearing a great deal about this issue in the coming year In the campaign of 1900 William Jennings Bryan called imperialism the burning issue of the campaign giving more zip to the customary labels of leading issue and paramount issue These are the formal intellectually approved subjects for debate a cut above the plebeian breadandbutter issue and in contrast to the gut issue which often deals with race or class resentments not to be mentioned in hightoned debate Gut issue probably long bruited about in politics on both sides of the Atlantic may have been first recorded in The Economist of London as recently as 1964 For Harold Wilson it was a carefully planned campaign    the neoKennedyism combined with a concentration on gut issues A generation before the word gut  from the Old English for bowel  was a part of college slang as gut course meaning easily passed course That referred to the bellys softness in general slang gutsy means courageous and gut used as an adjective in politics means visceral appealing to emotion rather than reason A switcher issue is known to pollsters as a subject of conflict such as abortion or gun control that would cause a voter usually aligned with one party to switch to the opposition on that matter alone The social issue coined in 1970 by the psephologists Ben J Wattenberg and Richard M Scammon denoted the concern with drug use alienation unrest and changing morality that seemed to be replacing the economic or breadandbutter controversies Whence character issue Whence whence That useful adverb means from what source place or cause from whence is considered redundant  and is usually followed by comes but a lot of us are treating that followup word as understood When looking for a neat and punchy opening word to a question about sources dont say hence to whence OK hence has two meanings 1 away over there as in Get thee hence and 2 therefore as in He flouted convention and hence the convention hooted at him which brings us back to the character issue Rhetoricians will recognize this as an example of a boomerang tangent a lurch off course that unexpectedly returns to the point The problem or shortcoming we call the character issue is as old as campaigning from the iciness of the Romans Coriolanus to the acknowledgment by Grover Cleveland of paternity of an illegitimate child Ma Ma wheres Pa was the slogan used to embarrass him but the phrase seems to have sprung up in our time In October 1979 Newsweek attributed the phrase to an unnamed politician in a piece speculating on a bid by Senator Edward M Kennedy to wrest the Democratic nomination away from President Jimmy Carter If Kennedy is the nominee the character issue will be fair game for the Republicans in the fall a Democratic strategist agrees Five months later The Associated Press observed In addition campaign aides said Kennedy was not hurt as badly in Massachusetts as in other states by the socalled character issue For weeks polls have shown and aides have conceded that Kennedy has been hurt by voter questions about Chappaquiddick and concerns about his marriage IN THE 1984 CAMPAIGN a columnist writing about Senator Gary Hart struck first Mary McGrory wrote that Vice President Walter Mondale was not however ready for Hart and his unexpected lethal challenge on the character issue Hart whose campaign is vaguely new and futuristic suggests that Mondale is old at heart Senator John H Glenn Jr then raised what he called the character issue by stressing personal accomplishments rather than position papers But it was left to Walter Mondale with his Wheres the beef campaign to imply that Senator Hart was a hollow or plastic man AP defined character issue as a synonym for questions about Harts age and his decision to shorten his name from Hartpence The next man to be brought down by the CI was Joseph Biden in 1987 Democrats use this issue on each other Republicans have not yet learned its efficacy When plagiarism charges began to fly Phil Roeder an Iowa Democratic spokesman was quoted by AP as sighing Theres the potential this could raise some of the character issues When Jane Ann Gephardt was asked about the tribulations of one of her husband Richards rivals she replied The character issue is important It is a necessary part of the campaign as painful as the process may be After the furor forced Mr Biden to abandon his candidacy a minor flap was caused by the revelation that the Dukakis camp had provided the media with the information that did him in standard political procedure in the past but now considered by some antipartisan types as some sort of indelicacy This admittedly was a dumb thing for a staff person to do said the same Iowa Democrat but this is not an issue that strikes to the character issue like the Hart incident and the Biden incident both did This historical study of the phrase shows how it began in an indirect slam at moral turpitude swung over to a general uneasiness about uprightness or straight whatyouseeiswhatyouget then swung back to a suspicion of hankypanky coming to rest today in a state of confusion To some it means hes a swinger to others it means you just cant trust him What is character anyway that makes it an issue that can cripple candidates This is one of the most powerful and mysterious words in the language no satisfying synonym exists for it Etymologically it is a 14thcentury English word from the Greek kharakter which means engraving tool and by extension the mark made by that tool the word character for example contains nine characters or letters By further extension the word came to mean the mark a person makes the features and qualities that distinguish that person from others But character has another sense beyond distinguishing trait It is the mark of an individual with a brave outlook and noble heart the person with character has the judgment to know what is right and the courage to do what is good The character issue takes aim at the degree to which a candidate falls short of that state as candidates and most human beings do Politics ruins the character said Otto von Bismarck in 1881 but Woodrow Wilson less cynically defined it in 1914 as a quality that cannot be deliberately created If you will think about what you ought to do for other people your character will take care of itself Character is a byproduct    William James the philosopher explained it to his wife in a letter in 1878 I have often thought that the best way to define a mans character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which when it came upon him he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive At such moments there is a voice inside which speaks and says This is the real me 
THE NATION; G.O.P. SEES SIGNS OF A ROBERTSON INCURSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/22/weekinreview/the-nation-gop-sees-signs-of-a-robertson-incursion.html,Bob Doles campaign chairman in Iowa Steven Roberts says that while Vice President Bush is still the major target Dole forces are real concerned about Pat Robertson John Buckley who does public relations for Jack Kemp says We have always taken Pat Robertson seriously Lee Atwater Mr Bushs campaign manager is more blunt Anybody who doesnt take Mr Robertson seriously he says is crazy Their concern is a measure of the emergent political importance of the religious right Exit polls indicate that 12 percent to 15 percent of Ronald Reagans vote in two successive elections came from bornagain Christians and some analysts say Mr Robertson might be able to count on even more In traditional terms that is by no means enough to win the Republican nomination let alone the Presidency But Mr Robertson is no traditional candidate as he demonstrated in Michigan where he matched or possibly outdid Mr Bush in early contests to select delegates embroiling state Republicans in acrimony in Iowa where he decisively won a straw poll earlier this year and in Florida where he came in a strong second last weekend in a straw vote that other candidates avoided saying the rules favored Mr Bush It is the zeal of Robertson supporters that makes him a political force to be reckoned with Most of Mr Robertsons supporters have had a personal religious experience and many as Pentacostal or charismatic Christians experience religion as ecstasy Their commitment to Mr Robertson is not political it is religious Americans for Robertson is as much a crusade as a campaign In numbers alone Mr Robertsons potential following is far from insignificant Gallup polls in 1986 found that 33 percent of adults identified themselves as evangelical or bornagain Christians and a 1981 Market Opinion Research poll found 36 percent of respondents answered yes to the question Was there a specific time in your life when you made a special personal commitment to Christ that changed your life Such a commitment is the central element of bornagain faith There is of course no guarantee that all or even most of these people will vote for Pat Robertson Many in fact feel that religion and politics dont mix  a fact Mr Robertson acknowledged when he gave up his ministry last month Even those who argue that Christians should have a stronger voice in government dont necessarily support Mr Robertson The Rev Jerry Falwell for example who as the founder of Moral Majority has probably done more than anyone else to bring Christians into politics is a vocal supporter of George Bush and says Mr Robertson cant win the nomination Mr Robertson draws high negative ratings in national polls not least because of the very beliefs that won him devoted supporters As a minister he practiced faith healing described his performance of miracles spoke in tongues and suggested that the end of the world and the Second Coming of Christ were close at hand In addition it is axiomatic in politics that the more a candidate succeeds the more his views and his past are exposed to scrutiny Already newspaper and magazine articles have examined Mr Robertsons fundraising tactics rebutted claims on his political resume and revealed that his first child was born 10 weeks after his wedding date Nevertheless the Republican field has been carefully respectful of Mr Robertson Just as the Democrats are loath to criticize the Rev Jesse Jackson for fear of alienating the black vote which is crucial to any Democratic victory a year from now Republican candidates fear a backlash from bornagain voters Beyond fundamentalist fervor Mr Robertsons campaign has both political expertise and money  he has spent 11 million more than any of his rivals Mr Robertson received 33 million signatures on petitions urging that he run and those names are now in a computer to be followed up by letters phone calls fundraising appeals and eventually with appeals to go to the polls in caucuses and primaries In targeted precincts volunteers are drumming up still more signatures they are aiming for 7 million which would produce enough votes they think to win the nomination Mr Robertsons campaign manager is R Marc Nuttle who has managed or advised dozens of Republican House and Senate campaigns Mr Nuttle said in September that 38000 Iowans signed petitions for Mr Robertson and field workers there say that figure is now much higher The turnout in the Republican caucuses is likely to be about 100000 people so if all the petition signers turned out  even fervent Robertsonians concede that is unlikely despite his elaborate phone bank there  he would place very well or even win in a sixway race The impact of his candidacy has struck fear into such liberal groups as People for the American Way whose Action Fund is seeking contributions to challenge the Religious Right and Pat Robertsons grab for ultimate political power as a recent mailing puts it The letter notes Already the Pat Robertson for President campaign has come much further than any political pros ever thought it would Stopping Mr Robertson is also much on the minds of Republican candidates The Bush forces for example are suing the campaigns of Mr Robertson and Representative Jack F Kemp in an attempt to have more Bush supporters selected as Michigan caucus delegates and on Friday publicly accused Mr Robertson and Mr Kemp of conspiring to change state party rules to further their own ends In the Florida straw poll last weekend Mr Bush won with the help of more than 1000 party officials and contributors Among the 1438 other participants who were chosen by county caucuses Mr Robertson actually won a majority of votes The only candidate thought to have any hope of winning over Mr Robertsons supporters since he shares Mr Robertsons abhorrence of abortion and his fervent anticommunism is Mr Kemp His strategists make no bones about their hope that Mr Robertson will ultimately falter after seriously damaging Mr Bush or Mr Dole or both and that Mr Kemp will pick up his support But Pat Robertson as he recently told Republicans in Minnesota figures it will be the other way around
COURTS ACTING TO FORCE CARE ON THE UNBORN,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/23/us/courts-acting-to-force-care-on-the-unborn.html,Ayesha Madyun a 19yearold Washington woman had been in labor two days when she arrived at DC General Hospital to give birth to her first child Eighteen hours later her labor had not progressed and the doctors decided that Mrs Madyun needed an immediate Caesarean section the babys likelihood of developing a fatal infection was steadily rising But Mrs Madyun wanting a natural delivery refused the surgery The hospital would not accept her decision Instead it won a court order authorizing the surgery It is one thing for an adult to gamble with nature regarding his or her own life it is quite another when the gamble involves the life or death of an unborn infant wrote Judge Richard A Levie of the District of Columbia Superior Court The Madyun case last year and similar court fights around the country pose harrowing problems for lawyers and doctors alike forcing them to balance a womans right to refuse treatment against societys desire to protect babies only an operation away from birth 21 Cases Are Cited in Survey According to a survey reported in the May 7 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine there have been at least 21 cases since 1981 in which hospitals have sought court orders to override the wishes of a pregnant woman by performing a Caesarean detaining her against her will or treating the fetus inside her womb In all but three cases the courts granted the orders deciding as Judge Levie did that they could not indulge the desires of the parents when there is substantial risk to the unborn infant In one of the most extreme cases so far George Washington University Hospital sought and won a court order last June requiring a Caesarean section before her 26weekold fetus was viable for a woman who was dying of cancer The woman and the baby died soon after the operation The woman and her husband had said that they didnt want the operation and the doctors on staff agreed said Lynn Paltrow an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who fought the order But the hospital legal staff called in outside counsel and within six hours they had a court order This month the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the order ruling that since the woman had at best two days left of sedated life the court was correct to place the interests of the unborn child over her right to avoid bodily intrusion They treated this woman as if she were already dead as nothing more than an incubator who is supposed to sacrifice her life said Ms Paltrow Abortion Debate Clouds Issue The question of how much treatment a pregnant woman can be forced to undergo is likely to become even more controversial with the development of more sophisticated prenatal diagnostic tests and treatments for fetuses still in the womb Already there is considerable debate about which groups of women should have genetic screening tests and whether doctors can require their patients to undergo such testing The issue of forced treatment is complicated by the continuing debate over abortion and the extent to which fetuses are entitled to legal protection In addition there is a growing consensus that many unnecessary Caesarean sections are being performed The percentage of Caesarean births in this country has quadrupled in the last 16 years to almost one in every four births The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently issued a policy statement that doctors were almost never justified in going to court to compel treatment for pregnant woman Some feminists and civil libertarians argue that compelled treatment is never justified because it violates a pregnant womans basic rights of privacy bodily integrity and selfdetermination Fetalrights groups meanwhile say an unborn child deserves as much legal protection as a pregnant woman Legal Basis Questioned Civil Court Judge Margaret Taylor of New York City who sits in Manhattan says she is convinced that there is no legal basis for forcing a pregnant woman to undergo medical treatment when any other legally competent man or woman would be allowed to refuse surgery that would benefit a third party I dont think a judge has the right to force a man to undergo the risk of surgery to donate a kidney for his child and I dont think the legal analysis is any different just because a woman is pregnant said Judge Taylor who turned down a hospitals request for an order authorizing a Caesarean St Vincents Hospital asked her to order a Caesarean section for a 35yearold indigent woman who had borne 10 children and had seen many women in her neighborhood suffer complications from gynecological surgery The hospital said the surgery was necessary because the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babys neck But a few hours after Judge Taylor refused to grant the order the woman delivered a healthy child I really sweated it out but I felt comfortable with the decision even when I accepted the doctors assessment that there was a probability that the baby would die said Judge Taylor George Annas a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Medicine said the question of forced Caesareans usually comes up in cases involving poor women foreign women or women who have religious beliefs the doctors do not share Some people say its because of the doctors fears of getting sued but I think thats wrong since these are not the kind of women that sue he said What I think happens is that a lot of doctors identify more with the fetus than with a woman who is different from them Attitudes May be Changing According to The New England Journal of Medicine report almost half the maternalfetal specialists surveyed last year said that women who refuse medical advice and endangered the life of the fetus ought to be detained in hospitals and forced to follow doctors orders But attitudes may be changing in the wake of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology statement against forced treatment issued in August Obstetricians should refrain from performing procedures unwanted by the pregnant woman the statement said The use of judicial authority to implement treatment regimens in order to protect the fetus violates the pregnant womans autonomy Dr Kenneth J Ryan whose committee wrote the statement said it represented a compromise between people who think about the protection of the fetus at all costs and the people who think about womens rights at all costs What we were trying to do was to get people to remember our fallibility in making these medical judgments and become a little less cavalier about overriding what the woman wants said Dr Ryan the chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Going to court has to be a last resort kind of thing since it destroys the physicianpatient relationship Some doctors and lawyers however argue that when a woman endangers her fetus by refusing treatment society must act Punishment a Possibility Im not saying we should seize women and strap them down if they refuse treatment  especially Caesareans which are so overused  but I think its silly to say women have no obligations before the baby is born said John Robertson a professor at the University of Texas law school If a woman refuses medical help and her child is born damaged as a result maybe she has fallen below acceptable standards and should be punished Maybe she should be turned over to the child abuse authorities who could punish prenatal child abuse just the same as postnatal abuse Last year in a widely publicized San Diego case Pamela Rae Stewart Monson faced criminal charges of child abuse for ignoring doctors advice during her pregnancy and for not summoning medical help when she began to hemorrhage Her braindead son lived only a few months The charges against Ms Monson a 27year old indigent woman who had received no medical care until late in her pregnancy were dropped in February But many lawyers and doctors saw the case as a harbinger of problems in the area and warned that it was only a small step from courtordered treatment to criminal penalties for those who refuse treatment Case Influenced Statement  It created a lot of revulsion said Janet Gallagher a New York lawyer who writes on the subject of fetal rights It showed just how brutal the legal process can be Dr Ryan said he had the Monson case in mind when drafting the part of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology statement that says court intervention in medical treatment may lead to undesirable societal consequences such as making it a crime not to follow doctors orders There are some real problems with the whole fetalrights argument said Judge Taylor Its absolutely clear that cigarettes and liquor are harmful to babies that bad nutrition brings brain damage So do you prevent a woman from doing those things the minute she gets pregnant And as a practical matter how is the judge going to enforce the orders If a woman says a month before her baby is due that she wont have a Csection do you put her in jail or chain her to a hospital bed until its time to deliver the baby
Feminism Goes Beyond Civil Libertarianism,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/24/opinion/l-feminism-goes-beyond-civil-libertarianism-259087.html,To the Editor In Feminists vs Civil Libertarians OpEd Nov 8 Stephen Gillers warns feminists that they will isolate themselves from civil libertarians who protect everyone and lose political power and public position if they continue to condemn pornography antiabortion pickets and trial tactics that focus on the victims supposed promiscuity Although feminist and civil libertarian goals often overlap feminism goes beyond the civil rights movement and its success depends on its ability to divorce itself from civil libertarianism when necessary The basic flaw in Mr Gillerss theory is his misconception of feminism as a subcategory of the civil liberties movement Feminism did not begin as a traditional civil liberties quest for constitutional and legislative equality Rather civil rights and legal equality have always been considered among the many prerequisites to achieving the ultimate goal of selfdetermination The feminist movement began with the realization that women were prevented from understanding and actualizing their true individual selves As Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote Our inner being which we call ourself no eye nor touch    has ever pierced Thus the feminist quest has been for a society in which women may realize their true individual identities The development of such a society entails not merely the attainment of civil rights but also a transformation in attitudes toward women a greater appreciation by women of our value as women the development of a new relationship between the sexes and more This is why feminists oppose the sexual exploitation of women through pornography prostitution and surrogate motherhood in which womens wombs become commodities This is also why onsite day care comprehensive sexual harassment policies and womens study programs are on the feminist agenda Although some of these goals are shared by civil libertarians many are not To the extent that Mr Gillers and other male civil libertarians fail to understand the unique qualities of feminism they are incorrect in perceiving themselves as allies of feminists LAURA ANNE SILVERSTEIN New York Nov 8 1987 The writer is a member of the NYU Law Women Steering Committee and coordinator of the NYU Student Sexual Harassment Committee
County Ordered to Pay For Prisoner Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/26/nyregion/county-ordered-to-pay-for-prisoner-abortions.html,A Federal appeals court ruled today that a New Jersey county must pay for abortions for prison inmates if no other public or private financing is available The ruling by a threejudge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld key portions of a decision by Judge Harold A Ackerman in Federal District Court in Newark However the appeals court narrowed Judge Ackermans ruling by not requiring Monmouth County to pay for all inmate abortions Instead it limited the countys financial responsibility to abortions when other funds like inmate resources or philanthropic grants are not available In the opinion written by Judge A Leon Higginbotham Jr the panel also struck down a portion of Judge Ackermans ruling requiring the county to arrange for the abortions However it said the county must provide transportation to medical facilities The case arose from a 1986 suit filed by the states Department of the Public Advocate on behalf of an unidentified 29yearold inmate at the Monmouth County Correctional Institution The woman citing cocaine and heroin abuse during her pregnancy and saying she could not cope with bearing a child requested an abortion at county expense At the time of her request the county required inmates to obtain a court order releasing them to go to an abortion clinic and it paid only for abortions deemed medically necessary Judge Ackerman said in 1986 that the policy was unconstitutional
Deadly Tale of Obtaining a Child Without Adoption,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/27/nyregion/deadly-tale-of-obtaining-a-child-without-adoption.html,The life and death of Lisa Steinberg illustrate how easy it was for a Manhattan couple to obtain a child and rear her without going through the formal process of adopting her The couple Joel B Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum face charges of murder in the beating death of 6yearold Lisa It began with what Michelle Launders thought would be a private or independent adoption of her newborn baby to be arranged by her attorney Mr Steinberg When she became pregnant in 1980 Ms Launders now 26 was desperate to disguise that fact and to find a suitable home for her child For Ms Launders who is a Roman Catholic there was no thought of abortion Portrait of Desperation In testimony before Surrogate Marie M Lambert this month in a hearing to determine who would bury Lisa Ms Launders revealed just how desperate and just how gullible she had been According to Ms Launders a friend referred her to Dr Michael Bergman an obstetrician who told her he knew a lawyer who could arrange the adoption Dr Bergman who died recently also arranged for her to live with his receptionist during the last months of her pregnancy About one month before the childs birth she testified she met Mr Steinberg in a Greenwich Village restaurant She was accompanied by her mother and Dr Bergmans receptionist The receptionist she said had told her to bring 500 in cash to Mr Steinberg to show good faith that we were going through with this and to start the legal process of filing papers Lawyers familiar with adoptions say it is highly irregular for a lawyer to solicit a fee in such circumstances It is also illegal they say for a lawyer to become involved in placing a child Absence of Suspicion The lawyer now representing Ms Launders Anthony W Cornachio said neither she nor her mother was suspicious about the payment To them they were dealing with a professional and this seemed like a way that very quietly their problem could be put to rest and the child would be taken care of Mr Cornachio said According to Ms Launderss account of the meeting Mr Steinberg explained that he could not allow her to sign legal papers until after the childs birth That was the last she ever saw of Mr Steinberg and she never signed any documents According to records at the New York InfirmaryBeekman Downtown Hospital which were submitted to Surrogate Lambert in the hearing Ms Launders gave birth to a girl on May 14 1981 at 812 AM I saw her for about 20 seconds she testified Steinberg Took Baby On May 16 the records indicated Dr Bergman gave the baby to Mr Steinberg who took it from the hospital Ms Launders testified that she had been in labor when she was admitted to the hospital on May 13 so Dr Bergmans receptionist had provided much of the information contained in the hospital records Among other things Ms Launderss address was listed in care of Joel Steinberg 14 West 10th Street an incorrect Social Security number was given a birth date was given to indicate falsely that she was 21 rather than 19 and a sister was listed as the next of kin Ms Launders has no sisters It is unclear why this inaccurate information was given to the hospital As for what became of the baby Mr Cornachio said in an interview Initially the child went to one couple and perhaps to more than one couple but the child was returned to Steinberg Naming Ceremony Why the child was returned to Mr Steinberg is unclear but according to a source familiar with the investigation Mr Steinberg may have sought a large sum of money from prospective adoptive parents who refused to pay For whatever reason Mr Steinberg and Ms Nussbaum kept the baby and within a few days of her birth they participated in a naming ceremony at the Teaneck NJ Jewish Center A rabbi issued certificates to them indicating that the childs name was Elizabeth Erin NussbaumSteinberg that her parents were Joel Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum and that her Hebrew name was Rochel Malya Tovah These documents are commonly issued by some synagogues though according to Rabbi Wolfe Kelman the executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly an organization of Conservative rabbis they have no official legal or even religious standing That fact apparently slipped the notice of school officials when Lisa was enrolled in Public School 41 According to testimony in the hearing those documents were accepted in lieu of a birth certificate  an apparent violation of state law The principal of PS 41 Elliott Koreman said he had been told by the Manhattan District Attorneys office not to discuss the documents or the circumstances of Lisas enrollment Lawenforcement officials in Manhattan and in Nassau County are now trying to determine whether Mr Steinberg was involved in a blackmarket baby ring how he ended up with Lisa and another infant and what if any criminal law he may have violated by not properly adopting the children
THE NATION; NOT MANY JUDGES PRACTICE WHAT THE PRESIDENT PREACHES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/weekinreview/the-nation-not-many-judges-practice-what-the-president-preaches.html,ALTHOUGH no President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been able to appoint more judges than Ronald Reagan the Federal court system has not yet become the conservative bastion that he and his supporters had intended It has not been for lack of trying By the end of his term Mr Reagan will probably have named more than half of the nations 743 Federal judges So far he has won Senate confirmation of 332 judges  249 of the 575 judges on the Federal District Courts or trial courts 75 of the 168 judges on the Federal appeals courts and six of the nine judges on the International Trade Court Of the nine Supreme Court Justices Mr Reagan has appointed two Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia Hearings are to begin Dec 14 on Mr Reagans nomination of Judge Anthony M Kennedy to the Court barring major revelations his confirmation is likely to come in February It is not clear however that the Reagan appointees are practicing the kind of judicial restraint the Administration has been preaching A sizable chorus of critics including some conservative theorists as well as the Presidents perennial detractors are saying that the Administrations determined effort to change the course of constitutional law is coming up short Kenneth R Feinberg a law professor at Georgetown University and a former aide to Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts said I am surprised at the marginal difference these appointments have made It seems that there are certain legal doctrines that have become so ingrained in America  like affirmative action the exclusionary rule like Miranda  that no socalled conservative revolution has been able to overturn it The impact so far has been modest said Bruce Fein a conservative legal expert with the Heritage Foundation here because precedents allow Reagan appointees little leeway unless the President succeeds in appointing a philosophically congenial majority on the Court Unless the Supreme Court changes youre just left with wiggle room as a lower Federal judge Mr Reagan was handed an enormous opportunity to leave his mark on the Supreme Court when Justice Lewis F Powell Jr retired unexpectedly last June But Administration officials privately concede that that opportunity may have been squandered in the crushing defeat of Judge Robert H Bork and the withdrawal of Judge Douglas H Ginsburg Judge Kennedy Mr Reagans third nominee for Justice Powells seat is considered a judicial pragmatist neither the right nor the left expects him to give new life to the Presidents social goals Accusations of Activism These goals were laid out in October 1981 when William French Smith then the Attorney General launched a broadside at Federal judges asserting they used expansive interpretations of constitutional rights to usurp the powers of elected officials on such issues as abortion school prayer and pornography He said Mr Reagan would appoint new judges attuned to the groundswell of conservatism evidenced by the 1980 election But a statistical study published last summer in the Columbia Law Review indicated that Reagan appointees have been only slightly if at all more conservative than judges named by Presidents Nixon Ford and Eisenhower The study compared the votes cast by Democratappointed judges with those of Republicans appointees in more than 1200 nonunanimous Federal appellate decisions Not surprisingly the latter were more likely to vote against civil rights plaintiffs criminal defendants and liberal public interest groups and in favor of business interests However just four of the Reagan judges  Justice Scalia Judge Bork and two other appellate judges Ralph K Winter and Frank Easterbrook  cast such votes with significantly greater consistency than other Republicans appointees The extreme right wants instant change but the courts dont work that way said Sheldon Goldman a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Of course precedents can be overturned but courts as a rule dont like to do that They prefer incrementalism rather than broad change The Administration was not just looking for traditional conservative advocates of judicial restraint it sought judges who supported what Attorney General Edwin Meese 3rd calls the jurisprudence of original intention  strict adherence to the intent of the Constitutions framers Judge Bork is perhaps the best known proponent of the original intention school but as the Senates resounding rejection of his nomination to the Supreme Court suggests the doctrine has not yet found a comfortable niche outside academia In a poll of 405 state and Federal judges released in August by the National Law Journal only 9 percent said they strongly agree with this doctrine Twentynine percent of the judges agree somewhat 23 percent disagree somewhat 34 percent strongly disagree and 4 percent said they didnt know To be sure several courts have acquired a decidedly different ideological hue under the Reagan Administration The 11judge Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered the nations second most important tribunal and long one of its most liberal has taken a sharp turn to the right since Reagan appointees became a majority last summer Bitter ideological feuding has characterized several decisions since including an important ruling striking down the District of Columbias quota of 60 percent blacks among new firefighters Similarly Reagan appointees have made the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago an increasingly important outpost for the lawandeconomics movement which seeks to weigh the importance of a right to an individual for instance against the cost to society of enforcing that right With the Reagan appointees the 7th Circuit is simply a horse of a different color on antitrust economic regulation and jurisdictional questions said Mr Fein of the Heritage Foundation Whether the Administration will be able to push other Federal courts along those lines in its remaining 13 months is increasingly doubtful For one thing a fierce battle is looming between Senate Democrats and the Justice Department over a new crop of judicial nominees Justice Department

REAGAN WANTS END OF TWO-TERM LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/us/reagan-wants-end-of-two-term-limit.html,President Reagan says that after leaving office he would like to start a movement to repeal the constitutional amendment that limits Presidents to two terms Mr Reagan in a restatement of a past position said the limitation interfered with the right of the people to vote for someone as often as they want to do The President discussed the amendment and other issues in a television interview conducted by the British personality David Frost that is to be broadcast this weekend along with discussions with two former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R Ford The program is to be followed in later weeks with interviews with candidates now seeking the Presidency Whether Mr Reagan will campaign actively to repeal the amendment remains to be seen He has declared strong support for two proposed constitutional amendments one to allow states to bar abortions and the other to prohibit Federal deficits but has not worked for their passage Not a Top Priority The twoterm limit established by the 22d Amendment in 1951 was pushed to ratification by Republicans concerned over the four terms won by a Democratic President Franklin D Roosevelt Since then only three Presidents have been elected to second terms  Dwight D Eisenhower Richard M Nixon and Mr Reagan  all Republicans In 1986 a White House spokesman Albert R Brashear said that although Mr Reagan had argued for repeal of the 22d Amendment on the ground that a Presidents effectiveness was restricted in a final term hes never mentioned that as a top priority In the Frost interview Mr Reagan said I would like to start a movement to eliminate the constitutional amendment that was passed a few years ago that limits a President to two terms Now I say I wouldnt do that for myself but for Presidents from here on The Frost series The Next President is syndicated and will be broadcast at various times across the country In New York the first program will be broadcast at 11 PM Sunday on Channel 9 In the interview with Mr Frost Mr Carter said that use of proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran to support of the Nicaraguan rebels was much more serious than the Watergate scandal that brought down the President Nixon The Presidents Disagree Watergate was a very simple relatively insignificant crime of breaking into an office and trying to steal some things from the Democratic Party Mr Carter said He did not mention the subsequent coverup of the breakin that reached into the White House Mr Carter continued The Iran scandal has damaged our nation in the MideastArabian Gulf area and internally as well The difference is that when Nixon made his Watergate mistakes the country was in a punitive mood The press was determined to punish President Nixon the Congress had that inclination and maybe the general public did as well Because of what Mr Carter called the horrible experience of Watergate he said Congress the press and the nation were averse to punishing Mr Reagan as severely He added that while he considered the Irancontra affair more serious than Watergate he approved of protecting the Reagan Administration from the full consequences Comments of Ford When Mr Frost conveyed Mr Carters assessment of the Irancontra affair to Mr Reagan and asked if he agreed the President replied No no Mr Ford was also critical of some aspects of the Reagan Administrations handling of the arms sales to Iran I think in my Administration we would have carefully supervised any highrisk covert or overt operation Mr Ford said Mr Reagan has been criticized by a Presidential review panel and a Congressional committee of inattention to the activities of subordinates When Mr Frost asked Mr Ford if he would have agreed to exchange arms for American hostages Mr Ford answered I dont think so if my Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State advised strongly against it Mr Reagan agreed to such a deal against the advice of his Secretary of Defense at the time Caspar W Weinberger and Secretary of State George P Shultz Mr Ford said I would have listened to the arguments of others but I cant imagine overruling the two top Cabinet officers and taking the judgment of some individuals of lesser responsibility

A CLARIFICATION ON LAMOTTE STATEMEBT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/nyregion/l-a-clarification-on-lamotte-statemebt-239287.html,The article Northern Democrats Assess Gains in Election [ Nov 15 ] reported on Patty Hotchkisss victory over Ursula LaMotte in County Legislative District 2 It said some believe Mrs Hotchkiss was greatly aided by a lastminute campaign by some who portrayed Mrs LaMotte as an opponent of legalized abortion Mrs LaMotte acknowledged that the misrepresentation of her views contributed to her defeat The above is not correct and it is important to set the record straight lest history be rewritten Of course it should be stated at the outset that the prochoice effort for Mrs Hotchkiss was conducted by Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion The coalition decided to support Mrs Hotchkiss after carefully discerning the positions on abortion rights of both candidates There was no misrepresentation of Mrs LaMottes position On Aug 3 I sent all candidates a letter and a questionnaire In the letter I suggested that it is in the candidates own interest to answer the questions so that our final evaluations accurately reflect your position I also invited them to call for information on an issue Mrs Hotchkiss sent her questionnaire in immediately and her views matched ours Mrs LaMotte failed to return the questionnaire and failed to return repeated phone calls until Sept 21 On that date Mrs LaMotte told me that though she was prochoice she opposed Medicaid funding of abortion except for rape and incest cases and supported parental notification or judicial bypass laws that force minors to get a court order for an abortion During the conversation I tried unsuccessfully to educate her and change her position but she took a hard line on the very issues that have come before the County Board [ of Legislators ] for a vote As I do routinely I took careful notes during the conversation On Oct 12 our political action committee began telephoning our supporters in District 2 Our callers sought support for Mrs Hotchkiss Our short script included the sentence Though LaMotte is not totally against abortion she supports the kind of laws that severely affect poor and young women Mrs LaMotte soon learned the calls were eroding her support On Oct 26 she called me to change her position on Medicaid but stood fast against minors rights She requested that we stop the phoning In my view she came around on Medicaid for political reasons I dont think shed have called to change positions if we hadnt been helping Mrs Hotchkiss No one here saw any reason to back off our support of Mrs Hotchkiss Since the election Mrs LaMotte and others say we misrepresented her position on abortion and engaged in a lastminute read scurrilous campaign against her In fact we gave her every opportunity to gain our endorsement by adopting a prochoice stance on the issues that come before the Board The coalition did play a part in Mrs Hotchkisss victory and is proud of being able to make an impact While Mrs Hotchkiss had a strong campaign and other important issues going for her we believe that a significant number of voters looked at the candidates positions on choice and went for Mrs Hotchkiss Were sympathetic to Mrs LaMotte as we are to anyone who loses a close election But in this case we believe she shot herself in the foot by taking the wrong position on abortion and is now trying to blame the coalition Had Mrs LaMottes position been the same as that of Mrs Hotchkiss the coalition would have endorsed both and stayed out of that race It is our fervent hope that all candidates of both parties will support the right of all women regardless of age or income to legal abortion POLLY ROTHSTEIN Director Westchester Coalition For Legal Abortion The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication should include the writers name address and telephone number Letters should be addressed to The Editor Westchester Weekly The New York Times 229 West 43d Street New York NY 10036 Because of the large volume of mail received we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or return unpublished letters

MAKING HAY IN IOWA,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/magazine/making-hay-in-iowa.html,FRED GRATZON FOUNDER AND CHAIRman of The Great Midwestern Ice Cream Company in Fairfield Iowa doesnt follow politics closely But hes hoping to turn a sweet profit on the battle for the Presidency He has established the nations first and only Presidential ice cream poll The 41yearold entrepreneur manufactures the ice cream and distributes it through his own stores in the Midwest and other retail outlets as far away as Bloomingdales in New York City Gratzon predicts sales this year of 5 million boosted he says by assigning flavors to the candidates campaigning for votes in Iowas precinct caucuses next February Preppymint for Vice President Bush Top Banana for the Senate minority leader Robert Dole Massachewy Chocolate for Michael S Dukakis Governor of Massachusetts Gratzon is keeping a daily tally of the candidates standing with ice cream eaters So intense is the competition among the contenders that they hardly dare overlook any opportunity to influence caucus voters Gratzon reports large orders for particular flavors orders he suspects originate with staffers seeking to tilt the poll results We are thinking about running the poll right up until about caucus time he says with satisfaction In his own small way Gratzon has carved off a piece of a gold mine The Federal election laws permit each of the candidates to spend about 750000 in Iowa Limits for each state are set according to votingage population and the inflation rate That means the contenders are likely to spend at least 10 million in the state whose caucuses are the first major contest in the race to succeed Ronald Reagan Thats just the beginning Candidates may generate more business for the state by importing volunteers who pay their own living expenses Staffs sometimes engage in creative accounting that winds up charging Iowa expenses against their limits in other states Moreover the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce estimates that spending by the candidates is equaled if not exceeded by that of the swarm of journalists who cover the caucuses unconstrained by any legal restrictions on their expenditures This year the campaign is expected to bring Iowa 25 million in sales of everything from beer to bumper stickers Thats as much as a national nominating convention generates for its host city and worth more than 60 million as it ripples through the states economy The focus of this spending is the night of Feb 8 when about 100000 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans out of Iowas 15 million registered voters will trudge from their homes to party caucus meetings The caucuses begin the process of apportioning delegates to the national conventions The Iowa caucus vote usually winnows a crowded field drastically and this year the focus on the state is especially intense The Democratic candidates tend to discount the New Hampshire primary traditionally a crucial early race because Dukakis is expected to have an edge as the popular Democratic governor of a neighboring state Some of the Democrats have been spending time and money on the Iowa caucus for more than two years The lavish courtship of caucus voters brings a welcome boost to the economy of a state now rebounding from almost a decade of hard times in agriculture and manufacturing This year more than ever it also appears to have inspired a search among Iowans for inventive ways to profit from the campaign The only hitch has been a tendency of some campaign staffs to spend more money than they have Many businessmen in Iowa have begun demanding payment on the spot or in advance The candidates court votes in a ritual unique in Presidential politics Television dominates in the other primary states but it is inefficient to broadcast messages to all 29 million Iowans when only about 1 in 15 votes in the caucuses Most spending on TV will be limited to the weeks just before the vote Meanwhile the candidates practice an anachronistic form of handtohand political combat Many Iowa voters expect to meet all of the contenders before they cast their ballot  and the candidates try not to disappoint It is just a daytoday thing says Representative Richard A Gephardt Democrat of Missouri who has been campaigning in the state since early 1985 Youve got to be out here the time required to get it done Candidates regularly appear in Iowa coffee shops or living rooms before groups as small as a dozen Anywhere else the price of getting into a room that size with a Presidential candidate would be a contribution of hundreds of dollars On one typical campaign day Gephardt began just after 7 AM in Bloomfield where he spoke to a small group of farmers By 930 he was in the ornate old Hotel Manning in Keosauqua where he stood in shirt sleeves and promised tough new trade and farm policies occasionally pounding his fist into his palm to emphasize his impatience for change After he finished his speech and briskly dispatched a few questions Gephardt pointed to a table in the back of the room Theres a signup sheet that we want you to sign he said because were starting to build the structure of people that will come to the caucuses Two dozen people wrote down their names From there Gephardt went on to Fort Madison Burlington Mount Pleasant Fairfield and Indianola where he spoke forcefully pounded his fist into his palm and collected about 85 more names of potential supporters In exchange for a 14hour day on the road he netted about 110 such expressions of support The candidates supplement these grinding personal appearances with intense efforts to identify and win over those who attended the last caucus and are most likely to vote again in 1988 For 10000 the state party provides a list of Democratic and independent voters including those taking part in previous caucuses That search involves a relentless cycle of telephone calls to measure the voters preferences and followup mailings intended to sway them A Democrat who attended the caucus in 1984 and in this race remains undecided until late in the process may receive as many as 10 pieces of mail from the Gephardt campaign along with the barrage of phone calls I would not want to be someone who went to the caucus in 1984 said Reid Wilson the Iowa campaign director for Senator Albert Gore Jr Democrat of Tennessee A lot of them enjoy it but they will get deluged Republican candidates are making similar efforts but their state party does not prepare a comprehensive list of previous caucus voters So the GOP contenders unlike the Democrats cannot easily lock their sights on a narrow target group Part of the action will shift to television in January when Iowa stations expect the campaigns to saturate the airwaves  a tactic that wont break the bank in a state where a 30second spot adjacent to the 6 PM news in Des Moines might cost only 500 It could potentially be very crazy very hectic says Ron Briggs sales manager for KCCI a CBS affiliate in that city In all the candidates are likely to spend some 2 million for spots on local television and radio stations  about 20 percent of their allowable Iowa expenditures So the bulk of the campaign money in Iowa will get spread around to a wide variety of businesses often along party lines There are for example Democratic printers and Republican printers The Carter Printing Company a small union shop has done work for the state Democratic Party for almost 20 years Referrals from the party according to Ron Hoyt the companys president were worth 64000 through the first seven months of the year about 20 percent of his total billing Hoyt insists that he is a political noncombatant  hell work for Republicans But Bob Anderson who owns Christian Printers Inc steers away from Democrats A lot of it is ideology he says Im more of a conservative guy I feel strongly about abortion and if a guy comes through and hes a big supporter of abortion I dont want to do his printing In Des Moines there are Democratic hotels and Republican hotels Democrats typically congregate and hold many of their events at the venerable Savery Hotel which is owned by William C Knapp an active local Democrat For many years the Hotel Fort Des Moines was known as the Republican hotel but it has been supplanted by the Des Moines Marriott Hotel the most modern downtown facility which opened in 1981 We just went after the business says Tom Booth the Marriotts director of marketing We found out who the Republican leaders were in the state and talked to them Now the state Republicans make the Marriott their caucusnight headquarters and the Fort Des Moines describes itself as nonpartisan We have Democratic candidates that stay here says Carole Chambers the Forts general manager and we have Republican candidates that stay here Partisanship extends even to bars The Des Moines Yacht Club a small dark establishment with a few weary ferns is the kind of place where the bartender asks if you want a glass for your beer Yet it is convenient to many campaign offices and was once considered a Republican hangout Then the Democrats caught wind of it and showed up says one Republican operative resignedly Now the GOP looks elsewhere for a place to unwind Pameco Inc a Des Moines mailing house no longer works for the GOP The Republicans found out we were registered Democrats said Ada Jackson a vice president Being registered Democrats has nothing to do with our corporation But people cant seem to discern that Pameco keeps busy anyway Jackson estimates that the company sent out a million pieces of mail tied to the 1984 race Triad Productions Inc in Des Moines has strung sound systems for most of the Republican contenders but for no Democrats Political preference has nothing to do with the imbalance says Jeffrey Niedermayer an engineer for the company The Democrats tend to use whatever is cheapest and generally they turn us down on the basis of price THE OTHER GREAT PLAYER IN the Iowa drama the national press corps suffers from no spending limits except those its accountants may devise and thats one of the best things to happen to Iowa since corn The press may be more economically important than the campaigns says Keith R Glaser a California real estate developer who ran Gary Harts 1984 Iowa campaign and is now helping Gephardt raise money They come in with unlimited expense accounts rent blocks of rooms at the downtown hotels and run open bar tabs all over the city I welcomed the invasion because we had no money to eat By taking us out for interviews those guys kept the campaign fed for the last two weeks Following the candidates lead this year the press has appeared early and in force Television stations from the home states of the candidates and foreign news crews have greatly increased their presence compared with previous caucuses In the final days before Feb 8 Iowa political operatives predict the state should host up to 2000 reporters and crews including large contingents from the television networks Hotel and restaurant owners await the presss arrival no less avidly than their counterparts in Fort Lauderdale anticipate spring break Major news organizations began booking caucusnight hotel space in 1986 The impact is sort of like an upsidedown bell curve says Booth of the Marriott Hotel It starts off well from January to May Then June July August is a little quiet But September to December and January of the caucus year through Feb 10 it is gangbusters Ellen Brown executive director of the Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau expects that occupancy in Des Moines area hotels in January will run 80 percent 20 points higher than average and about double the increase experienced four years ago On caucus night itself she expects all 6000 hotel rooms within a 10mile radius of Des Moines to be filled Restaurant owners are getting ready for the influx Michael R LaValle the owner of City Grille a neon and chrome Des Moines restaurant that looks as though it got lost on the way to Los Angeles plans to install several television monitors and stock up on cold liquid refreshments There are only two things these guys want he says Theyre not going to want to miss the nightly news And theyre going to want to have a beer you know that Reporters and campaign aides transplanted from Washington have already found Des Moines to be a congenial town for drinking even if state law requires the bars to close by 2 AM Des Moines is a great place a Democratic campaign aide says enthusiastically sitting in a bar crowded with young people You can get a Heineken for 125 An influx of reporters is also good news for car rental companies Nothing else generates as much business in Iowa for Hertz to meet the demand the company may have to import cars from as far away as Minneapolis Northwestern Bell which installs hundreds of additional lines for reporters in the final weeks also enjoys the surge of business The company charges a months rate 45 and an installation fee about 105 to turn on a line even if only for a day or two And in the final days before the vote when the major news organizations descend in force Iowas caterers come into their own LaValle whose catering affiliate worked for several of the networks in 1984 recalls the frenzy It was a 24houraday job NOT EVERYONE IN IOWAS business community looks forward to the invasion of politicians Horror stories of unpaid bills and other woes abound In 1984 Dewey Vukovich the owner of Dewey Ford Inc in Des Moines leased a van to the staff of John Glenn the Democratic Senator from Ohio When the campaign moved on to New Hampshire so did the van Then it went to Florida Vukovich says with a sigh We threatened to file charges against the person who was driving it and then it came back Elliott Flying Service a charter company finally wrote off charges accumulated by the 1980 Presidential campaign of John B Connally The campaign ran out of money long before Connally who recently declared bankruptcy Candidates may come and go but debts endure Like several other local businesses Koch Brothers a Des Moines office supply firm settled for partial payment of Gary Harts 1984 debt This year a printer Don Westerheim actually extended credit to the Hart campaign for the printing of a speech in which the candidate responded to the revelations about his relationship with Donna Rice a model Westerheim eventually got his money but Harts withdrawal from the race left a number of Iowa businesses once again uncertain about payment Disgust with politicians who dont pay tends to be bipartisan There isnt any truth to any of them Republican or Democrat says Dick Koch of Koch Brothers They get a bunch of young dreamyeyed kids to work for them they dont understand finance and they let someone else worry about the money if they can get away with it Ive got to be smarter than they are Many vendors seem to have reached the same conclusion The phone company and local television stations always demanded large deposits or cash payment in advance but this year they have been joined by virtually everyone else charter services mailing houses audiovisual services The standard thats set in Iowa now says William J Fleming a Gephardt aide is money up front And its not negotiable either So far the tough policies are only an irritant to the campaigns but candidates without deep financial resources could find their lastminute efforts hampered by the new reluctance to grant credit Early this year Senator Doles Iowa staff rented a helicopter to take him from an appearance in Marshalltown to another in Pella a 45mile journey When the helicopter arrived the pilot turned to his passengers and said laconically but firmly Youll be paying me now He didnt move until Doles regional field director Tom Synhorst wrote a personal check Thats Presidential politics in Iowa a helicopter pilot telling the minority leader of the Senate just where and when to get off

A Conservative Call for Compassion,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/30/us/a-conservative-call-for-compassion.html,An influential conservative group is issuing a major new manifesto this week that chastises some in the movement as lacking compassion toward the needy The document Cultural Conservatism Toward a New National Agenda insists that the future of the American right rests more on cultural issues than economics It tries to sketch a consistent moral vision that unites a conservative critique of sexual permissiveness with an assault on social indifference in the economic sphere The 146page statement of conservative principles is to be made public Tuesday by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation a research organization closely aligned with the New Right The foundation and political action groups that are affiliated with it played important roles in the rise of the conservative movement in the 1970s The product of more than two years of work the statement comes as conservatives are vigorously debating their movements future and often conveys a pessimistic tone reflecting the fears of many conservatives that their cause is losing the political initiative in the twilight of the Reagan years Different Conservatives The document highlights fundamental differences between economic conservatives whose views are dominated by a faith in free markets and an opposition to government action and cultural conservatives who value tradition over the market and favor some state regulation of personal behavior Paul M Weyrich president of the Free Congress Foundation and an architect of the statement said one of its purposes was to reintroduce Americans to cultural conservatism after many years in which the right was defined largely by opposition to government Conservatives make a mistake in identifying with a politics that says it really doesnt matter what happens to the community as long as those who can survive get theirs he said There is a wonderful tradition in this country of serving others It is time we develop a conservative doctrine of service Mr Weyrich said he expected the statement to arouse substantial controversy among conservatives in part for its remarkably critical approach to the current state of the nation This he said reflected the unhappiness among cultural conservatives like himself with the Reagan Administration Meeting of Left and Right While the statement takes positions on many issues that are anathema to liberals its proposals in some areas an emphasis for example on helping the poor become selfreliant and support for programs to help poor people refurbish their own homes  reflect a convergence of the right and the left And some of the documents passages on the decline of the American economy echo sentiments expressed regularly on the campaign trail by Democratic Presidential candidates Both liberals and conservatives have been disturbed by Americas cultural drift the document declares Both realize that a moral vacuum is dangerous to a nation The absence of a moral base breeds a me first ethic of greed and ostentation and a loss of the concept of the common good As conservatives have long asserted the document sees this cultural drift as leading to high rates of divorce illegitimacy premarital sex and abortion the spread of pornography and a disrespect for religion Among its recommendations are a substantial toughening of divorce laws an end to legal abortion a voucher program to strengthen private and parochial schools and a reversal of court decisions that fail to recognize that a general encouragement of religion does not violate the principle of separation of church and state It is implicitly crtitical of homosexuality although it avoids strident language Root of Economic Ills But the statement goes beyond familiar conservative critiques of permissiveness in arguing that a cultural breakdown is at the root of many of Americas economic ills Both parties are moving to face a situation new in our history the very real prospect of longrange economic decline the statement said Though it is obscured by bright shortterm economic indicators the underlying situation is that much of our industry no longer competes as effectively as it once did One reason for this the statement says is that in a cultural free market the limits restraints and selfdisciplines required by traditional ways of living cannot compete with aggressively promoted liberationisms Human nature leads most people to put todays pleasure above tomorrows Carefully distinguishing between freemarket conservatives and traditionalists the statement maintains that some of the former are against welfare In their view if the free economy leaves some people destitute  so be it the statement says The cultural conservative view is different We accept the obligation to the less fortunate that welfare represents We accept it because it is one of the Wests longeststanding traditions Corporations Criticized The document is particularly harsh in criticizing what it calls a yuppie elite whose life revolves around materialism and status and it says many modern corporations are guilty of bureaucratic behavior a lack of concern for workers and an indifference to the suffering and disruption caused when large plants suddenly shut down Through several decades of cultural drift the values standards and principles that Americans could count on other Americans to share have been dwindling in number and content the document says at another point The prevailing standard is set not in terms of living up to sound values but in BMWs Mercedes career advancement lines of credit of being seen in the right places with the right people so as to show access and power Particularly in its approach to education the statement reflects an attempt to codify expressions of cultural conservatism that have been made popular by people like Allan Bloom the author of The Closing of the American Mind and William Bennett the Secretary of Education Cultural conservatism it says is the belief that there is a necessary unbreakable and causal relationship between traditional Western JudeoChristian values definitions of right and wrong ways of thinking and ways of living  the parameters of Western culture  and the secular success of Western societies
Speeches Offering Insight Into Judge Kennedy,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/us/speeches-offering-insight-into-judge-kennedy.html,Speeches written over the years by Judge Anthony M Kennedy show that he has expressed cautious skepticism about whether the Constitution protects sexual privacy and other rights not actually spelled out in the text Judge Kennedy President Reagans Supreme Court nominee has also questioned some decisions of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren expanding procedural protections for criminal defendants and aspects of the Courts handling of the 1974 Nixon tapes case But in none of the 20 speech texts obtained by The New York Times has Judge Kennedy stated flatly that the Courts privacy decisions have been wrong or argued for overruling any of the decisions His overall tone in the addresses to groups such as fellow judges graduating law students and Rotary clubs has been one of moderation subtlety and respect for tradition and precedent [ Excerpts on page B7 ] Most Previously Unpublished The speech texts which span the period from 1975 to last month and served as guidelines for the judges remarks were provided by the Reagan Administration to the Senate Judiciary Committee late today Most have not previously been published They will provide grist for questioning when hearings on his nomination begin Dec 14 Judge Kennedys speech texts provide the most detailed insights so far into his overall judicial philosophy and shed new light on his views about issues ranging from judicial enforcement of unenumerated constitutional rights to the rights of crime victims and criminal defendants Presidential powers federalism the Bernhard Goetz case and other issues In a 1986 speech discussing unenumerated rights including the right to sexual privacy Judge Kennedy said undue judicial activism in this area undermined representative government and the courts claim to be a neutral arbiter The speech texts are generally consistent with the image of the 51yearold Sacramento jurist as a thoughtful moderate man who is considered likely to win overwhelming Senate confirmation next year Judge Kennedy like President Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has repeatedly called in his speeches for judicial restraint and fidelity to the Constitutions language and history and has warned against the raw exercise of political power by courts In a 1984 speech he said My own judicial philosophy has been described by others as conservative and therefore unlikely to accept doctrines which substantially expand the role of the courts None of us like a simple label to explain our thought but the description is probably apt as a general rule But none of his speech texts mount the kind of broad attack on the modern Supreme Court or sound the kind of clarion call for a return to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution that marked the writings and speeches of Judge Robert H Bork and that contributed to the 58 to 42 Senate rejection of his nomination And some of Judge Kennedys statements contrast with those of Judge Bork both on particular issues and on broader philosophical approaches to constitutional law Judge Bork had worked out an overarching constitutional philosophy that led him to condemn much of modern constitutional law with an air of certitude that some critics called arrogance Judge Kennedys speeches on the other hand repeatedly sound the theme that neither he nor perhaps anyone else can plumb all the Constitutions ambiguities or provide definitive answers to the hardest questions it poses  such questions as how far the Supreme Court should go in restraining majority rule and how powers over foreign affairs should be allocated between the President and Congress Twilight Zones of Uncertainty My position has always been that as to some fundamental constitutional questions it is best not to insist on definitive answers he said in the text of a 1980 speech on Presidential powers The constitutional system works best if there remain twilight zones of uncertainty and tension between the component parts of the government The surest protection of constitutional rule lies not in definitive announcements of power boundaries but in a mutual respect and deference among all the component parts In an August 1987 speech to a Federal judicial conference in Hawaii he observed that its necessary to develop a theory of constitutional interpretation that respects the intentions of the framers of the Constitution and confines judges but that its far easier to point out the defects in someone elses theory than to defend the merits of your own Judge Kennedy is said by acquaintances to be widely read in American constitutional history and there is much evidence of this in his speech texts They are studded with references to littleknown but telling historical details and with apt quotations from the writings of political and judicial figures including James Madison Alexander Hamilton George Mason Oliver Wendell Holmes and others as well as from literary figures ranging from John Keats to Sigmund Freud to Jeremy Bentham According to one former law clerk Judge Kennedy has typically prepared his speech texts himself rather than having them drafted by law clerks He has used them as rough outlines rather than reading them aloud verbatim And he has declined to publish them in law reviews because he had not polished them to his satisfaction Stanford Speech Cited Judge Kennedys most detailed discussion of the Supreme Courts decisions enforcing a right to sexual and family privacy came in a 1986 paper prepared in connection with lectures at Stanford University Law School His views on privacy rights are of particular interest both because four of the Courts current eight members have indicated they would narrow or overrule the Courts most controversial decisions in this area those protecting abortion rights and because of what happened to Judge Bork Many of Judge Borks opponents placed special emphasis on his scathing attacks and flat rejection of the Courts entire line of decisions recognizing a generalized right to privacy since 1922 including a 1965 decision recognizing a right to use contraceptives Judge Kennedys Stanford lecture suggests the Court should not announce in a categorical way that there can be no unenumerated rights in the Constitution that judges can enforce and in this and other contexts he has made seemingly approving references to some of the Courts decisions protecting family privacy But in contrast to some liberal jurists Judge Kennedy also asserted in the lecture that it is imprudent as well to say that there are broadly defined categories of unenumerated rights He stressed the difficulties encountered in defining fundamental protections that do not have a readily discernible basis in the constitutional text including sexual privacy the right to travel and certain voting rights the Court has recognized Among those difficulties he said are the problem of judicial interference with the responsibilities of elected officials to determine the attributes of a just society and the imperative that the constitutional text and its immediate implications traceable by some historical link to the ideas of the framers must govern the judges If courts adjudicate claims by premises that are essentially political they forfeit their right to independence to the respect due a neutral arbiter and to lifetime tenure he said No Specific View on Abortion Judge Kennedys speech texts contain no specific discussion of the Courts decisions protecting rights to abortion and contraception One of his recurring themes is as he put it in his 1986 Stanford lecture One can conclude that certain essential or fundamental rights should exist in any just society It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system In other speeches Judge Kennedy has made these points  He said in his 1980 speech on presidential powers that the noble but general phrases of the Contitution do not by themselves provide the answers to the questions whether the Chief Executive has exceeded the bounds of his constitutional authority He added that the course of history and the necessities of modern life have dictated that great powers flow to the President in foreign affairs subject to the authority of Congress to issue corrective instructions in appropriate cases  In the same speech Judge Kennedy said there is room for argument about the wisdom of the extraordinary procedure by which the Supreme Court expedited a case pending in a lower court in order to require President Nixon to surrender the Watergate tapes to a special prosecutor in 1974 He suggested it might have been better to wait and let Congress solve its own problem with the Executive over Watergate which was the subject of impeachment proceedings But he did not say the Court should have upheld Mr Nixons refusal to surrender the tapes  In a March 1987 speech in New Zealand Judge Kennedy denounced the callousness of the criminal justice system towards the victims of crimes and suggested that while expanding defendants rights in the 1960s the Supreme Court had slighted the problems of victims In the same speech noting the disturbing public sympathy for Bernhard Goetzwho shot four youths in the subway in fear they might assault him the nominee said the public acclaim with which Goetzs actions were received in some quarters indicates that the present criminal justice system breeds disrespect for the rule of law In a 1981 law school commencement speech Judge Kennedy said some of the refinements we have invented for criminal cases are carried almost to the point of an obsession He did not specify which refinements he meant but in some judicial opinions he has criticized the rigidities of the rules against use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials
Poll Finds Reagan Support Down But Democrats Still Lacking Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/us/poll-finds-reagan-support-down-but-democrats-still-lacking-fire.html,President Reagans popularity is sliding and so is support for the Republican Party the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll shows But the survey found that the current field of Democratic Presidential candidates was in a poor position to take advantage of this opportunity because the individual Republican Presidential candidates were far more popular The poll found a significant decline in popular approval of the way Mr Reagan is handling his job And for the first time in four years Americans disapprove of his performance on both foreign and economic policy The survey of 1553 Americans conducted by telephone from Nov 20 through Nov 24 found that 45 percent of Americans approve of the way Mr Reagan is handling his job and 44 percent disapprove This was a significant decline for the President since last months poll which was taken Oct 19 in the week of the stock market plunge In that survey 52 percent approved of Mr Reagans performance and 38 percent disapproved Both surveys had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points The new survey suggests that in a kind of delayed reaction the stock markets difficulties and the related economic news have significantly reduced public confidence in Mr Reagans ability to oversee the economy Thirtynine percent of Americans approved Mr Reagans handling of the economy compared with 54 percent who disapproved The last time a majority of Americans disapproved of Mr Reagans economic performance was January 1983 at the end of a severe recession The latest poll also found a majority of Americans disapproving Mr Reagans handling of foreign policy by a margin of 49 percent to 38 percent The decline in confidence in Mr Reagan is translating into support for the Democratic Party Asked which partys Presidential candidate they expected to support in 1988 39 percent of registered voters said the Democrats candidate while 30 percent said the Republicans This was a significant shift in favor of the Democrats from the TimesCBS News Poll taken earlier this month That survey found 34 percent favoring the Republicans and 32 percent favoring the Democrats In the current poll only about half of those who said they voted for President Reagan in 1984 were prepared to say now that they would vote for the Republicans again in 1988 The Democrats seemed to be gaining most among groups that had been Republican bastions people under 30 and those economically better off Still as all 12 Presidential candidates prepare for a televised debate tonight on NBC the survey demonstrated clearly that the Republican Presidential field remained much better known and better liked than the Democratic field The researchers asked Americans if they had a favorable or an unfavorable view of each of the 12 candidates Sixtyfive percent had a favorable view of at least one of the Republican candidates while only 46 percent had a favorable view of at least one of the Democrats Moreover Republicans like their field of candidates far more than Democrats like theirs Among Republican primary voters 82 percent liked at least one of their partys candidates among Democratic primary voters only 56 percent liked at least one of theirs Barometer in South In a finding that could bode ill for the Democrats next November the survey showed that among white Southerners a key swing group 39 percent said they liked at least one of the Democrats By contrast 71 percent of white Southerners liked at least one Republican Although the public has not yet demonstrated much affection for the Democratic candidates it does seem to be moving toward the Democrats on many issues For example 38 percent said they favored reducing military spending up from 28 percent last month The proportion favoring increases in military spending fell to 13 percent  the lowest recorded in Mr Reagans entire term  from 18 percent last month The shift on the military spending issue since the beginning of the Reagan Administration is staggering In January 1981 when Mr Reagan took office 61 percent of Americans favored increasing military spending while only 7 percent thought it should be cut Support for social programs in the meantime remains high By a margin of 78 percent to 19 percent Americans say that the Goverment should guarantee medical care to everyone By 71 percent to 26 percent they say that the Federal Government should see to it that everyone who wants a job has a job They favor federally sponsored daycare programs by 62 percent to 35 percent They reject cuts in social programs to balance the budget by 60 percent to 33 percent Aversion to Tax Increases On one significant issue taxation President Reagan does seem to expressing the popular view 60 percent of Americans say they are unwilling to pay more in Federal taxes to cut the budget deficit But 37 percent say they would be willing to pay more in taxes to cut the deficit New York TimesCBS News surveys using a slightly different question found substantially less support for a tax increase in both January 1984 and January 1985 The shift may reflect the extensive attention given the emergency budget negotiations that followed the stock markets plunge Among the Democratic Presidential candidates only two Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts are viewed more favorably than unfavorably even within their own party And neither is yet broadly known or broadly popular Underlining the Democratic difficulties is the fact that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas a Republican candidate had a better rating among Democratic primary voters  29 percent favorable 15 percent unfavorable  than any of the partys own candidates The Rev Jesse Jackson leads among registered Democratic primary voters with 25 percent up from 17 percent last month Mr Simon has 10 percent no change from last month Mr Dukakis is at 9 percent down from 13 percent last month Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee had 6 percent in the latest poll Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri 5 percent and former Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona 1 percent But by far the largest number of Democrats 42 percent were undecided or declined to choose The lack of support for existing Democratic candidates is a major factor feeding support for Governor Cuomo of New York When Mr Cuomos name is added to the list the standings among Democratic primary voters are Mr Jackson 23 percent Mr Cuomo 22 percent Mr Simon 11 percent Mr Dukakis 7 percent Mr Gore 6 percent Mr Gephardt 3 percent and Mr Babbitt 1 percent The proportion declining to make a choice fell to 26 percent Mr Cuomo insists he will not get into the Presidential race if he did his candidacy would be especially harmful to Mr Dukakis On the Republican side the bad news for the Reagan Administration has so far left Vice President Bush largely unscathed Mr Bush has slightly expanded his nationwide lead over Mr Dole This month Mr Bush led Mr Dole 48 percent to 20 percent last month Mr Bush was ahead of Mr Dole by 43 percent to 22 percent In the current survey all the other Republicans lagged far behind Pat Robertson had 7 percent Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York 5 percent former Secretary of State Alexander M Haig Jr 4 percent and former Gov Pete du Pont of Delaware 2 percent THE NEW YORK TIMESCBS POLL Campaign Issues Where Voters Stand The Government in Washington should Regulate

POLL WAS CONDUCTED The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov 20 through Nov 24 with 1553 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example the potential error for registered Democratic primary and caucus participants is plus or minus 4 percentage points and for registered Republican primary and caucus participants it is plus or minus 5 percentage points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll
MAN IN THE NEWS; Patient Point Man in the Prison Crises: Joseph Michael Quinlan,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/us/man-in-the-news-patient-point-man-in-the-prison-crises-joseph-michael-quinlan.html,There were more than enough crises on J Michael Quinlans agenda when he took over this summer as director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons The Federal prison system was 60 percent over capacity with 44000 inmates crammed into 47 institutions Congress was unwilling to spend more money on prisons but quite willing to toughen drug laws and sentencing guidelines and send the system even more prisoners AIDS presented a threat with legal ethical and medical dimensions that no one had sorted out But 10 days ago before the 46yearold director had been on the job five months the twin uprisings of Cuban detainees in Federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale La made all other problems secondary An agency that penetrates the public consciousness only when there is trouble was suddenly in big trouble The problem was not of the prison bureaus making the riots were the consequence of policies set by the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service for which the bureau basically provided human warehouses With that impetus Mr Quinlan became in effect the line officer in a crisismanagement team that included senior officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department the parent agency of the FBI and the prisons bureau New to News Conferences Mr Quinlan became the public voice of the search for a solution A career Federal employee who had never been in the public spotlight or held a news conference he presided over six news conferences in the last six days In a calm manner he declared over and over that no precipitous action would be taken and that the safety of the hostages was paramount My patience is endless he said a number of times That patience was borne out by the settlement Sunday of the Oakdale uprising Negotiations in Atlanta are continuing A slightly built man who wears squarish steelrimmed glasses and has a decided New York accent Mr Quinlan is a lawyer and a former prison warden who has been a rising star at the Federal Bureau of Prisons headquarters here for years He was the handpicked successor of Norman A Carlson who retired last year after running the prison system for 17 years and who placed Mr Quinlan in key jobs beginning more than 10 years ago Hes Unflappable Mr Carlson who now teaches at the University of Minnesota said in a telephone interview today that Mr Quinlan was by far at the very top of all the people Ive encountered in his career Hes unflappable Mr Carlson said He has a very good analytic mind and a very deliberate style of management His hallmark is fairness Joseph Michael Quinlan was born in Rockville Centre LI on Nov 2 1941 His father was an insurance agent He graduated from Fairfield University in Fairfield Conn in 1963 and three years later from Fordham Law School He served as a lawyer in the Air Force and began his corrections career almost by accident joining the prison bureau in 1971 because he wanted to be a Government lawyer and the bureau had an opening For four years in the mid1970s he was Mr Carlsons executive assistant He then ran the Federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and in 1980 became the first warden of the Federal prison at Otisville NY He came back to Washington in 1985 as deputy assistant director for the bureaus Medical and Services Division Before becoming director on July 1 Mr Quinlan was Mr Carlsons deputy for 15 months As director of the prison bureau Mr Quinlan supervises 13000 employees and is paid 72300 a year Serves on Bar Panel Mr Quinlan and his wife Mary whose maiden name was also Quinlan although the two are related only by marriage live in Springfield Va with their two young daughters For several years Mr Quinlan has served on the American Bar Associations Committee on Prison and Jail Problems of which he recently became vice chairman The twodozen members include legal services lawyers academics and others devoted to the cause of prisoners rights In interviews some said described Mr Quinlans approach to committee work as openminded and without institutional bias Hes interesting and different a positive force in corrections said Alvin Bronstein director of the American Civil Liberties Unions National Prison Project which has brought many lawsuits against prison officials over the last 15 years He mixes more broadly than other corrections officials Mr Bronstein added Hes a lawyer who understands the concepts of due process and fundamental fairness Praise for 2 Decisions He said they met in the early 1970s when Mr Quinlan was an assistant to the warden at the Federal prison in Leavenworth Kan He recognized that corrections officers didnt always tell the truth any more than prisoners do Mr Bronstein said Thats a big hurdle to get over with a lot of career corrections people Mr Bronstein praised Mr Quinlan for two recent policy decisions One was to close down a highsecurity unit for female inmates at the Federal prison in Lexington Ky that was criticized as being too restrictive The other was Mr Quinlans response to a Federal law passed last year to bar the use of Federal funds for abortions for pregnant prisoners Mr Quinlan believing that inmates who wanted abortions should be able to get them contacted Planned Parenthood to arrange for free or lowcost abortions at clinics near Federal prisons Hes a quiet person but people listen to him because his judgment is good said Ira Robbins another member of the Bar Association committee who is a law professor at American University and active in prisoners rights issues Ive been confident he would come up with a decent solution to the Cuban situation At his news conference today Mr Quinlan was asked how the overcrowded prison system could absorb the Cuban detainees who are to be spread among a dozen other institutions after their release from Oakdale As always we will tighten our belt he said Were a very proud and cando organization
Justice Dept. Denies Querying Views of Nominee,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/us/justice-dept-denies-querying-views-of-nominee.html,The Justice Department said today that Judge Anthony M Kennedy President Reagans nominee for the Supreme Court was not questioned in advance about how he would vote on issues likely to come before the Court Before the selection of Judge Kennedy to fill the Courts vacant seat neither the President nor other officials asked the nominee his views on any case issue or subject that could be decided by the Justices the department said The department made the comments in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee which had requested documents on any communcations between Judge Kennedy and Administration officials Assistant Attorney General John R Bolton acknowledged the department had informal lists of questions that Judge Kennedy might have been asked but did not make clear whether they would be given to the panel Use of Litmus Test Assailed Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont a committee member said the panel should press for everything the department had available We have to make sure somebody is not appointed based on litmus test commitments of how they will vote in cases coming up he said in explaining the committees document request Conservative supporters of the President have expressed hope that the next Reagan appointment to the Court could tip the balance in their favor in their drive to ban abortion and quotas in employment based on race and to lower the wall of separation between church and state Confirmation hearings on the Federal appellate judge from Sacramento Calif begin Dec 14 Little opposition has come to light leaving a much calmer atmosphere than last September when a battle had broken out over the Reagan Administrations first nominee to the Court Judge Robert H Bork Furor Over Marijuana Use Judge Borks narrow reading of individual rights protected by the Constitution led to his defeat by the Senate 58 to 42 The Administrations second choice for the vacant seat on the Court Judge Douglas H Ginsburg asked Mr Reagan on Nov 7 to withdraw his nomination after a furor erupted over his past marijuana use In the letter Mr Bolton said the President met with Judge Kennedy Nov 9 and Nov 11 and asked questions relating solely to personal data and Judge Kennedys individual qualifications
Giuliani Weighs Private Post as Step to Senate Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/nyregion/giuliani-weighs-private-post-as-step-to-senate-race.html,Rudolph W Giuliani the United States Attorney for New Yorks Southern District says he has talked in detail to two law firms about joining them an important step to his imminent decision on challenging Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan next year Mr Giuliani a Republican insisted this week in an interview that such talks do not mean that he has decided to run for the Senate or even that he soon will leave the United States Attorneys office an event widely expected before the end of the year As he describes them the discussions are part of an intricate process he has designed to try to distance any political decision which he believes he has another four to five weeks to make from his prosecutorial duties A logical first step he said would be a return to private life almost inevitably with a law firm and at an annual salary that Steven Brill editor of The American Lawyer said he believed would range between 750000 and 125 million Speculation and Effectiveness Only then Mr Guiliani said would he have the freedom to explore a Senate race trying to put together a campaign organization and the 4 million to 6 million required for a statewide campaign Some officials who work with Mr Giuliani however said they believed the months of speculation about his political future which he has done little to encourage but nothing to refute  have begun to interfere nonetheless with the work of his office mixing politics with law enforcement in an unconscious relatively benign but ultimately distracting way How Does It Get in the Way Mr Giuliani heatedly rejected any suggestion that his work or that of his associates was suffering from his political uncertainty How does it get in the way he demanded his pale face flushing It shouldnt get in the way if theyre doing their job It doesnt get in the way of my doing my job His duties as United States Attorney Mr Giuliani said are his first priority He continued Whatever I do later there will be no job I ever wanted to do more than this one Still many friends and associates said they believed he would leave it and its 77500 salary before the end of the year Mr Giuliani said he was struggling to advance certain current cases in which he is deeply involved  especially in the area of political corruption  to a point where others can supervise them Thats part of the reason why I cant extricate myself as easily as some people on the outside think you can Mr Giuliani said If someone came to me and said and could prove to me You must leave today because if you dont leave today you wont be able to run for the Senate I would not be able to leave Those closest to him  his wife Donna Hanover his dearest friend the Rev Alan Placa and his longtime mentors Harold R Tyler a former Federal judge and now with the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler and United States District Court Judge Lloyd F MacMahon  confirmed that Mr Giuliani had not yet decided to run for the Senate but is increasingly intrigued by the idea What Comes Next Rudy knows that US Attorney isnt a permanent job and shouldnt be said Judge MacMahon whom the 43yearold Mr Giuliani served as a clerk Hes got to think of what comes next Staying in any one job too long is not good for the job or the person said Father Placa a childhood friend But trying to find the right moment to withdraw is difficult Rudy wants to do a good job correctly and well without leaving things dangling Hes much too wise and practical a man to really be a Hamlet and wring his hands forever Id be fascinated to see him run for office if not the Senate than another Father Placa said It would be a wonderful model to show that an honest man of modest means can run for office Hes a young man and there are a lot of options said Ms Hanover an anchorwoman on WPIXTV But he was brought up to public service and when we walk down the street to dinner people say Mr Giuliani  run man run So theres a kind of momentum that gets fed more and more Judge Tyler a prominent Republican who has had a hand in many of Mr Giulianis career moves is one of the few to say he would like to slow the momentum Being a good and effective prosecutor and a capable lawyer doesnt make you immediately into an oddson candidate for senator  there are different skills involved he said Weve discussed all these issues and Rudys bright enough to perceive them All Rudys friends say While youve got this notoriety go go go or lose the edge They say hes just like Thomas E Dewey In the 1930s Mr Dewey turned crimebusting prosecutions into political success Executive Skills And Capital Post But Im not at all sure that in modern New York State politics the analogy fits said Judge Tyler Im sometimes amazed by this comparison to Tom Dewey There was no television then and the press was different Nor is Judge Tyler convinced that Mr Giuliani often praised for being a skilled administrator and motivator of young people will be happy in the Senate I fervently hope hes thinking about that very carefully Judge Tyler said Hes had executive jobs very effective training for a man who wants to be governor or mayor of a big city Does that really help a junior legislator in the worlds greatest deliberative body as they call themselves Father Placa said I think his greatest gifts demonstrated to date are his abilities as a prosecutor as an administrator and executor A race for the Senate would mean a change of focus Im not sure whether he would be happy or not Mr Giuliani reacted defensively to these comments saying he should be happy in the Senate I think Id be very good he said I dont have any question that I could do the job in an innovative and creative way In the Senate Mr Giuliani said I think Id be able to focus on issues that other people have not been able to bring to the national forefront like the drug problem which we talk about a lot but dont do those things that need to be done to turn it around He suggested that if senators articulated a plan and held the Administration to account wed see a lot more movement But Mr Giuliani admitted that running for office left him cold citing the domination of appearance over substance and the loss of privacy as issues that hold me back Ive always had an ambivalence about running he said when asked if his indecision had deeper roots I knew that when I got to the decision it would be a much bigger gap to jump over than people realize A lot of it has to do with the fact that  is there enough substance in running for office and holding public office Opinion Polls And Foreign Policy There is a certain gap between substance and appearance in any visible thing you do in America he said As United States Attorney the substance drives the appearance he said You know youve made the separation and it will turn out all right that in time the criticism will fall away But you run for public office Mr Giuliani continued and its hard its really hard Things get out of control people view things single issue A lot of silly issues predominate Mr Giuliani a Roman Catholic once described as a priest in prosecutors clothing is critical of most politicians whom he regards as cowardly looking to avoid difficult votes and public choices He uses the word pander a lot and with great contempt to describe politicians who pay too much attention to opinion polls McGovern Democrats who were too solicitous of the Soviet Union and Americans who attend fundraisers for President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua an act he describes as mindboggling Mr Giuliani praised President Reagan for forcing the Soviet Union to negotiate an arms agreement saying The balance of forces between democracies and totalitarian governments has to be at least equal if not slightly tipped in favor of democracies not only to deter totalitarian governments but to lead them to become more reasonable Asked if that did not describe Mr Reagans contra policy Mr Giuliani hesitated saying that the United States had for too long ignored its borders and its neighbors He said he was so uncomfortable about the information I get from either side that I dont think I know the answer to that He criticized Mr Ortega but said Im not sure the contras are the right answer I dont know I would have to learn a lot more Mr Giuliani is similarly imprecise on other issues that have little to do with his current job He is opposed to abortion which is wrong but does not regard it as murder The leap from there to what you do  given the way were tragically divided by it isnt easy I dont think theres a facile answer He said he would like to reduce the number of abortions through better education but as a legislator would be bound by the Supreme Courts decision legalizing abortion At the same time he said I would vote against public funding for it and against anything that would extend it beyond where we are now He has given considerable thought to the politics of policymaking calling for a foreign policy based on the strengths of a society open to competing interests which recognizes that the era of bipartisanship is over and looks to build consensus We waste all this energy moaning about things that used to be he said instead of taking advantage of a much more open process which if used right should longterm build a much stronger sturdier policy that should withstand a few opinion polls Whether such issues can be explored in a political campaign however is another matter especially since the press is driven by the lowest common denominator he said Personal Plans And Party Needs His concerns were echoed by Ms Hanover who said During a campaign thered be a lot of not so much the attention because theres nothing to hide but the press is allowed to make up stuff about public figures and to caricature people  look at what they do to poor Princess Di and Nancy Reagan Ms Hanover said she was also concerned a Senate seat might mean too much separation given her job in New York Thats definitely one of the major things on both our minds she said how much it would mean him being away from us We waited a long time to have this little boy Their son Andrew Harold is nearly 2 years old Donna is a woman with a career of her own said Father Placa He said that while Mr Giuliani tried a corruption case in New Haven that was difficult for him to be separated from his wife and his child for a whole week He continued Any job that has built into it that kind of separation has a question built in But its not like a commute to the West Coast Ms Hanover said Im not going to say to him Dont do it because of this But I will say Keep your priorities straight And he says You and Andrew are No 1 in my life and as long as I know that I say Go for it if its what you want  Certainly Mr Giuliani is under considerable political pressure to run from a Republican Party looking for fresh and plausible candidates in a postReagan postIrancontra scandal political cosmos Anthony J Colavita the party state chairman struggled hard to be neutral  he needs a challenger to Mr Moynihan no matter what Mr Giuliani decides  but could barely restrain his enthusiasm I believe Senator Moynihan is beatable and that someone like Rudy Giuliani can beat him Mr Colavita said Hes got great positive name recognition in the most expensive market New York City Were a party  we can help with organization advice money  but first hes got to decide if he wants public life or a law firm Tom Mason of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in Washington said Our negotiation with Rudy Giuliani is very high level and we dont want to push too hard But the sooner he gets in the better it is Qualities Known And Untested Senator Alfonse M DAmato who has encouraged Mr Giuliani to run said Hed be a great boost to the ticket and to the party But he understands it will not be an easy task This is a Democratic state with a wellknown Democratic incumbent At this point the interesting thing about Giuliani is that nobody knows said David Garth the political consultant His record looks good hes a relatively young guy with a baby and a wife he smells like New York not like a Brahmin But that has nothing to do with being a candidate You dont know that until you get into a campaign Giuliani is untested how he handles that kind of pressure Giuliani is going through what we call the five stages said Jennifer Duffy of the National Republican Senatorial Committee referring to the psychological reactions  denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance  that Elisabeth KublerRoss described as typical of those facing imminent death What hes going through isnt so terribly unusual for prospective candidates Ms Duffy said They all go through it in one way or another
"WASHINGTON TALK: Supreme Court Nominations; After Bork, the Liberals' Silence On Judge Kennedy Is Deafening",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/04/us/washington-talk-supreme-court-nominations-after-bork-liberals-silence-judge.html,With the Senate Judiciary Committees hearing on the nomination of Judge Anthony M Kennedy barely a week away most of the liberal groups that were in the forefront of the successful effort to keep Judge Robert H Bork off the Supreme Court are maintaining a wary silence The contrast could scarcely be greater with the impassioned discourse that consumed the days and weeks leading up to Judge Borks hearing before the Judiciary Committee three months ago At that time the air rang with denunciations of Judge Borks views and warnings that his elevation to the Supreme Court could unravel the constitutional status quo Now organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union People for the American Way the Alliance for Justice and the National Abortion Rights Action League are refraining from taking positions until Judge Kennedy finishes answering questions at his hearing which begins Dec 14 Dozens of Lawyers at Work The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights a major force in the antiBork coalition has two dozen lawyers studying Judge Kennedys record and says it does not know when or whether it will take a stand on the nomination The changed atmosphere reflects the difference between certainty and ambiguity The outspoken Judge Bork perhaps the countrys best known conservative legal theorist was a symbol of everything that liberals did not want on the Supreme Court well before his longanticipated nomination by President Reagan But Judge Kennedy was largely an unknown quantity when nominated despite having written more than 400 majority opinions in 12 years as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit An Opaque Picture The picture that has emerged in the three weeks since his nomination is from the liberals point of view frustratingly opaque he has been virtually silent on such matters as abortion and related issues of privacy he has taken some actions that have alarmed feminists but at the same time he has no apparent agenda or desire to remake the law according to his own vision Ambiguity is not a comfortable state of mind for an issueoriented lobbying group And some liberal leaders searching for a strategy that best serves both their cause and their organization speak with some nostalgia about the heady days of the Bork fight when the battle lines were sharp and the call was clear Bork was easy Kate Michelman director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said with a slightly pained smile Now she said in an interview in the organizations headquarters here I feel a tremendous weight and burden The pressures on the abortion rights league are exacerbated by the fact that its issue maintaining womens constitutional right to choose abortion was widely perceived as hanging in the balance the moment Justice Lewis F Powell Jr announced his retirement last June For Justice Powell was a member of the Courts dwindling prochoice majority Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Ms Michelman said Roe v Wade is as threatened today as it was the day Justice Powell resigned I keep asking myself Can we risk being wrong  Consequences of Crying Wolf But although the abortion rights league is in some respects in a special position its dilemma is typical of the problems facing the groups that fought Judge Bork and that are now trying to decide what to do about Judge Kennedy Despite her deep concerns about how Judge Kennedy might vote in abortion cases Ms Michelman said she also is concerned about the consequences of crying wolf It doesnt serve the cause of womens reproductive freedom for us to be kneejerk or overreactive she said The effort against Judge Bork was a highly positive event in the institutional lives of many of the groups that participated including the abortion rights league It gave them visibility it energized old members and attracted new ones it placed the issues the groups care most about at the forefront of public debate and as a special bonus the fight succeeded The abortion rights league itself which has 250000 members and a budget of 35 million gained 11000 new members and raised 13 million during the peak of the fight against Judge Bork I Need to Balance That Obviously I want and our members want NARAL to continue to be in the forefront to have its voice heard Ms Michelman said But I need to balance that Our work enhanced our image as a mainstream effective organization and I dont want to dissipate any of that Norman Dorsen president of the American Civil Liberties Union which like the league has deferred taking a position said in an interview that his organization too felt the pull of the continued high visibility that came from the Bork battle I think every group in a way is in that position he said But I think were disciplined enough to examine this nomination on its merits The dilemma was brought home to Ms Michelman a psychologist who has headed the abortion rights league for two years within hours of Judge Kennedys nomination She was invited to go on network television to discuss the new nominee She thought about it and turned it down A Risk to Credibility The opportunity to go on network TV and have our point of view aired is very important she said But I couldnt do it without substantive information just for the sake of getting our name out there I couldnt take advantage of the opportunity without risking our credibility The league has two staff lawyers devoting full time to studying Judge Kennedys record Ms Michelman along with a number of other leaders of the Bork opposition is critical of Senator Joseph R Biden Jr the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee for scheduling the hearings barely a month after Judge Kennedys nomination There was a twoandahalf month gap between Judge Borks nomination and the start of his hearings Ironically because we know less about Judge Kennedy we need more time Ms Michelman said Senator Biden has said that although the hearings will probably take no more than a week the committee will not vote until early February He has also said that the hearing record will remain open until the vote for any groups that want to analyze the hearings before arriving at their position Although Judge Borks supporters tended to portray the opposition as a monolith in fact the antiBork coalition was made up of some very different organizations with separate institutional needs and their own internal clocks NOW Takes a Stance Two weeks ago the National Organization for Women became the first national civil rights organization to announce opposition to Judge Kennedy Its president Molly Yard said that based on his judicial opinions and private club memberships Judge Kennedy was a sexist whose confirmation would be a disaster for women Some other civil rights leaders said privately that NOW was making a strategic mistake by attacking so forcefully so soon Im not sure how it plays Ms Yard said in an interview Wednesday But we would have been negligent in our duty if we hadnt said it she continued For us to remain silent would have been a total admission of cowardice Everyone else was giving him a free ride and somebody had to say Hey wait a minute there are problems 
Dole Offers Iowa Voters A 'Down Home' Theme,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/05/us/dole-offers-iowa-voters-a-down-home-theme.html,It was dusk and the window of Chucks Palace Cafe was fringed with ice and Christmas lights Inside about 200 Iowans farmers and factory workers sipped coffee as Bob Dole pointed to a 7yearold boy for a question Whats it going to be like if you become President asked Jonathan Ruf Mr Dole the Senate Republican leader who is a key contender for the Presidential nomination seemed nonplussed for the moment Well I dont know he replied slowly I work hard I tell the truth And I try to remember where Im from Ill try to remember that when I was a county attorney I had to approve welfare claims for my grandparents because they were poor and old and broke Mr Dole continued in a rising voice The point of it is Ill remember precisely where Im from and there are a lot of people in this country that are hurting From Pancakes to a Hangar Mr Doles message to the Iowans whose Presidential caucuses Feb 8 will provide the first votes of the 1988 campaign echoed the down home theme that the 64yearold candidate repeated frequently Thursday a grueling day of campaigning that began with a pancake breakfast with farmer representatives in Des Moines and ended in a town meeting at a chilly airport hangar in Waterloo In between Mr Dole spoke on a radio callin show and hopping the state in small chartered planes attended town meetings in Sioux City and such towns in heavily Republican northwest Iowa as LeMars and Sibley Although Vice President Bush holds a lead of 2 to 1 over Mr Dole in most national polls recent surveys show the Senator moving ahead of Mr Bush in Iowa where victory is considered crucial to Mr Doles campaign On Thursday sizable and enthusiastic crowds welcomed the Senator who for the last year has made repeated stopovers in Iowa when traveling to his home state neighboring Kansas His speeches and comments here are marked by pointed efforts to contrast himself a man of nononsense leadership and experience and competence who grew up as a farmboy in Russell Kan with Vice President Bush to whom he frequently makes acidic references Asked by a reporter in Des Moines to discuss the differences in their agricultural policies Mr Dole said without hesitation I know whats going on and he doesnt Agriculture is not his strong suit I dont know what it is but its not agriculture Hard Knocks and Subtle Ones Most of Mr Doles comments about Mr Bush are references sometimes subtle to the Vice Presidents Ivy League background and wealth Speaking to a group of elderly Iowans in Sioux City Mr Dole said American voters want someone who understands the issues the Government Congress but just as important someone whos been tested and understands hard knocks and understands the problems of real people Of his own background Mr Dole said to a group of students at Westmar College in LeMars I went to public schools Some of the candidates didnt have that advantage Although Mr Dole has made strenuous efforts to erase his image as a hatchet man he can nonetheless seem testy with critics a trait his advisers are uneasy about On a callin show on radio station WHO in Des Moines a woman echoed criticism by one of his rivals Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York that Mr Dole was seeking to raise taxes to ease the Federal budget deficit You have a history of raising taxes the woman began In 1982 you singlehandedly pushed through the highest tax increase in the nations history   Youre calling from Jack Kemps headquarters replied Mr Dole No Im not And if you see Jack say hello from me Walter Mondale said he would raise taxes and he carried one state How can you say youre the most electable candidate Thats wellwritten material you have there said Mr Dole Lets face it In the world youve got to govern I cant help what Walter Mondale said That may have been a very courageous statement but it wasnt very smart Maybe he deserves a badge for being courageous A Political Tightrope In his daylong tour of Iowa Mr Dole was asked several times about his stand on abortion a powerful issue among some conservatives in the state Dole aides said Mr Kemps organization had suggested that the Senator and his wife Elizabeth Hanford Dole the former Transportation Secretary were hazy on the issue Mr Doles response was in some ways symptomatic of the political tightrope he walks as he seeks to gather conservative support but also reach out to moderates I do have a very strong prolife voting record he said in Des Moines Its been consistent The record is there This is a fundamental issue a basic issue People feel strongly about it So do I And then Mr Dole added But I dont want to lose people who say I dont want that guy because of his stance on abortion I would suggest that people listen with totally different views There are a lot of things that bring us together and there are a lot of things we can agree on and I would say that in addition to the unborn we ought to take a look at abused and neglected children if were talking about children and what we ought to be doing
Jersey Seeking Plans to Aid Students With 80's Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/05/nyregion/jersey-seeking-plans-to-aid-students-with-80-s-problems.html,To show just how profoundly life has changed for teenagers over the last few decades Drew Altman New Jerseys Human Service Commissioner recites a list of school discipline problems in the 1940s and in the 1980s In the 40s the most frequent discipline problems included talking chewing gum making noise running in the halls getting out of turn in line wearing improper clothing and not putting paper in wastebaskets In the 80s the problems include drug abuse alcohol abuse rape robbery assault burglary arson bombings murder absenteeism vandalism extortion gang warfare abortion and venereal disease To Mr Altman the list  compiled by California education officials  has become a verbal snapshot of why New Jersey is putting socialservice programs in schools to help teenagers succeed in the classroom and beyond Everything From Soup to Nuts We live in a different society he said and we can no longer just teach reading writing and arithmetic in the schools and think weve done our jobs This month New Jersey is to award 6 million to establish schoolbased service programs in 30 school districts at least one in each of the states 21 counties The programs will provide everything from soup to nuts in services dealing with three core issues  jobs health care and mental health and family counseling he said Mr Altman said New Jerseys program is the first of its kind Were trying to eliminate the artificial boundaries between education and human services and to bring services that are all over the map under one roof New Jersey did not have to look to California to document the problems afflicting teenagers who make up the only age group in the country with a rising mortality rate according to state officials In New Jersey more than 40 percent of those between 12 and 17 years old have used drugs alcohol or both Accidents account for 55 percent of deaths in this group and many accidents are related to drug and alcohol abuse Suicide is the second leading cause of death among New Jersey teenagers and drug and alcohol abuse is also a factor in onethird of the cases According to estimates 30000 teenagers between 15 and 19 become pregnant each year Last year 11000 gave birth risking low birth weight infant death and maternal mortality at twice the rate of adults In 1986 about 4800 adolescents had sexually transmitted diseases and many others have chronic health problems that go untreated or undiagnosed because of lack of access to health care About 1000 teenagers are treated each year for mental illness in residential centers or psychiatric hospitals Each year 20000 teenagers drop out of high school the dropout rate reaching 50 percent in some cities The teenage unemployment rate is over 20 percent reaching 60 percent in some cities The 30 schools selected for the program will be chosen from more than 60 that have applied The schools had to devise their own programs with community groups unions and parentteacher organizations The money for the initiative cannot be used to pay for existing services Because the program includes health services it has drawn fire from some groups that say they fear it will promote abortion Weve taken a neutral position on the question of family planning Mr Altman said If the school district wants to have it thats OK If they dont thats OK too However state funds cannot be used to pay for contraceptives or abortion services Mr Altman said about half the applicants have included family planning in their proposed health services Proposals Based Near Schools The assistant commissioner for intergovernmental affairs Edward H Tetelman will coordinate the statewide program once the grants are awarded Our success is going to depend on just how well we market the program in each local district he said The kids will know whether were really concerned They want someone who will talk with them and not at them They want a framework in which they can make decisions They want someone to lay out the pluses and minuses and help them talk through their problems The programs will be operated from buildings perhaps storefronts near the schools They will be staffed to provide substanceabuse counseling employment services health screening and referrals and some recreational and social activities One proposal included setting up a kitchen so the teenagers could start a food service to help raise money for the program There also will be some community outreach programs to bring dropouts back into the schools High Schools TeenAge Mothers New Brunswick High School one of the schools that applied for a grant reported in its application that it has 700 students out of a citywide highschoolage population of 1400 The remainder attend St Peters High School or vocational school or do not attend school New Brunswick High has a dropout rate of 19 percent and in the 198687 school year reported 26 suicide threats and seven unsuccessful attempts The school placed 35 to 40 students in an alternate school program because of their disruptive or antisocial behavior The municipal court reported that youngsters between 13 and 17 years old were arrested for crimes including 20 robberies 39 burglaries 78 thefts 50 simple assaults 38 narcotics violations and 12 drug sales Substanceabuse counselors working with teenagers report that 50 percent of the citys population has used drugs or alcohol Between 1983 and 1987 there were 197 teenage pregnancies in the city that were brought to term and 160 of the teenage mothers were students at New Brunswick High School There are no statistics about how many pregnancies were terminated LowIncome Families Most of the high schools students come from lowincome families 55 percent qualify for the free lunch program and 13 percent for the reducedcost lunch program The high school has designated New Brunswick Tomorrow a nonprofit social planning agency as its program manager if its application is approved The president of New Brunswick Tomorrow Ted Hardgrove said the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Mental Health Center in Piscataway and the Robert Wood Johnson Mental Health Center have agreed to serve as key subcontractors for the program We also would use the Eric B Chandler Health Center which is about a mile from the high school to integrate our medical program and have enlisted the Civic League which will be out on the streets trying to encourage those who have left school to go back he said The Puerto Rican Action Board and the Community Outreach Center two organizations that deal with the needs of the citys Hispanic population would also take part and the Greater New Brunswick Day Care Center would provide day care so teenage mothers could go back to school
Pennsylvania Tries Again to Limit Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/us/pennsylvania-tries-again-to-limit-abortions.html,Women would be required to notify sexual partners before having abortions under a bill approved by the Pennsylvania Legislature and girls under the age of 18 would need parental consent or a court order to allow the procedure The Senate voted 33 to 16 Wednesday on the bill passed the House last week by 140 to 59 It would replace a law struck down in 1986 by the United States Supreme Court Gov Robert P Casey a Democrat has said he opposes abortion but has not said whether he would sign such a bill He said this week that he would review it when he received it Informed Consent Requirement The bill also requires physicians to tell women awaiting abortions the nature of the procedure its risks and alternatives Before giving her consent to an abortion the woman in most cases would have to certify in writing that she had received the information The bill would also prohibit legal services from using public funds to advocate abortion Opponents of the measure denounced the renewed antiabortion efforts by Pennsylvanias Legislature which has repeatedly approved such laws since the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion They predicted it would be thrown out by the courts if the Governor signed it Morgan Plant executive director of Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Affiliates said the General Assembly was attempting to play God with the lives of women calling the bill unconstitutional antiabortion legislation at the behest of a small but vocal minority The bills backers disagreed This bill does not restrict a womans right to have an abortion said Howard Fetterhoff executive director of the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference It doesnt prevent a woman from having an abortion Proponents called the bill a carefully planned response to the 1986 Supreme Court decision that struck down Pennsylvanias 1982 law In some instances as with the segment requiring that doctors provide informed consent only minor changes were made The 1982 law said a woman had to be told of potential unforeseeable harm and available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and childbirth A woman then had to wait 24 hours before the abortion would be performed Other sections of the 1982 law required reports from doctors on each abortion they performed and that two doctors be present for abortions in the last three months of pregnancy
The Larger Nuclear Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/opinion/the-larger-nuclear-debate.html,LEAD It is of great importance that the treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear weapons and the further possibility of a dramatic cut in strategic nuclear weapons in 1988 be seen as the beginning of a deeper public involvement with arms control issues The danger is that these hopeful developments will instead further anesthetize a citizenry that for much too long has avoided serious thought and creative debate about nuclear weapons It is of great importance that the treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear weapons and the further possibility of a dramatic cut in strategic nuclear weapons in 1988 be seen as the beginning of a deeper public involvement with arms control issues The danger is that these hopeful developments will instead further anesthetize a citizenry that for much too long has avoided serious thought and creative debate about nuclear weapons Many thousands of these weapons will remain after a treaty is signed Their existence hovers over and indeed alters most other major issues  some directly relations with the Soviet Union and with our allies the Middle East terrorism Islamic fundamentalism and some indirectly a willingness to foul the environment the breakdown of ethics drug use lack of idealism among college students Who can measure the impact of the widespread doubt about the future of humanity on these issues But a relationship clearly exists What has been missing is the good common sense that usually accompanies overt active public interest in public affairs On the nuclear issue the public is concerned but not engaged troubled but largely unlettered Surveys and everyday experience indicate more interest in toxic waste AIDS crime abortion and taxes Why do we have this situation The instinct of most people is to avoid thinking about nuclear war It is overpowering depressing complex it threatens mental stability And there are no victims on television to compel our attention indeed the most common TV images are of the protests of the far left thereby allowing the public to persuade itself inaccurately that this is a subject of concern only to wellmeaning but naive ultraliberals Meanwhile the great majority of knowledgeable and responsible moderates pushing for change in our nuclear policies unwittingly cooperate in this evasion by confining their views almost exclusively to specialized publications And so out of sight of the public swirls a debate on nuclear tactics  a nasty debate and an endless one Not surprisingly a general public that is worried about the nuclear threat but unwilling to dwell on it gives off contradictory signals seeming to favor summit meetings arms treaties and detente but also arms buildups and Star Wars Conservatives view the peace movement as highly powerful if wrongheaded journalists know the public doesnt care about details of nuclear weapons and arms control Mailings of peace groups have done poorly since an arms deal seemed close and the fear is that a public not knowledgable about the great number of nuclear weapons that will be left will convince itself that the danger has passed Meanwhile policies and plans are in place about which most of the public has no knowledge and would not support if it did American commitment to a firststrike policy computertriggered responses plans for fighting and winning a nuclear war If people did know once they understood the tactical reasons that seemed to make these policies necessary their reaction would very likely be not so much against these tactics as against our having allowed ourselves to get into a position that seemed to make them necessary To break this cycle the public needs to feel that the subject can be understood that it can and must make a difference  instead of hiding as it now does behind the excuse that the issues are too complex and must therefore be ceded to the experts The debate over the treaty on intermediaterange forces could be the beginning of this process

CATHOLIC TAX CASE TO GET A HEARING,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/08/us/catholic-tax-case-to-get-a-hearing.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to consider whether to kill on jurisdictional grounds a lawsuit seeking to revoke the Federal tax exemption of the Roman Catholic Church The suit filed by abortionrights groups against the Government contends that the church has violated Federal law by using taxexempt funds in political campaigns But the Court ruling to result from todays action will presumably address only the technical question of whether the plaintiffs have a direct enough interest in the matter  or standing  to sue The issue of whether Catholic groups have violated rules involving taxexempt groups has yet to go to trial In May 1986 after two major Catholic organizations cited in the suit refused to give the plaintiffs internal records of antiabortion activities Federal District Judge Robert L Carter of Manhattan found them in contempt of court He ordered fines of 100000 a day until they comply with the document demands and the Catholic appeal of his contempt citation is the issue before the Supreme Court The fines against the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have been suspended pending appeals Lawyers and church officials have said they could not recall a contempt ruling with such stiff penalties against any major religious group Previous Cases on Standing We hope that this action signals that a favorable end to this burdensome and intrusive case is in sight Monsignor Daniel F Hoye general secretary of both Catholic groups said today He said that Judge Carter and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which rejected the groups appeal have been insensitive to the jurisdictional objections raised by the Government and the Church The Catholic groups argue that the Court has repeatedly held that third parties lack standing to challenge the tax exemptions of other groups Most recently in 1984 the Court ruled that parents of black publicschool children lacked standing to challenge the taxexempt status of private schools they believed to be discriminatory Solicitor General Charles Fried filed a brief for the Government urging the Court to hear the church groups appeal and saying the case raised important issues involving the separation of governmental powers By seeking to force revocation of the tax exemption the plaintiffs are essentially seeking to exercise control over the executive branchs allocation of its lawenforcement responsibilities Mr Fried said If the Supreme Court rules that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Churchs tax exemption that would effectively end the lawsuit If it does not the 100000aday fine would begin to mount unless and until the Church complies with the document demands and the suit would continue in the district court No Ruling on Tax Exemption The Court has not agreed to consider in the current appeal United States Catholic Conference v Abortion Rights Mobilization No 87416 the underlying issues of whether the Church has used taxexempt funds improperly and whether its tax exemption should be revoked Nor have the lower courts ruled on those issues The plaintiffs assert that the Government has allowed the Catholic Church for years to use taxdeductible contributions in a nationwide campaign against abortion The plaintiffs say that by selective enforcement of Federal restrictions on taxexempt funds the Government is effectively giving a subsidy to the church that is unavailable to them and to others who support abortion rights The plaintiffs said in a Supreme Court brief that contrary to Federal tax law the church has engaged in a nationwide persistent and regular pattern of intervening in elections in favor of candidates who support the churchs position on abortion and in opposition to candidates with opposing views Such activities the plaintiffs allege violate the Federal tax laws restriction of taxexempt status to religious charitable and educational organizations that do not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office Suit Was Filed in 1980 The two Catholic groups have not conceded that they violated any legal restrictions Carl Eifert a spokesman for the groups said today that they had a longstanding policy to carefully avoid any partisan political stance Abortion Rights Mobilization and about 20 other plaintiffs filed the suit in 1980 against the Internal Revenue Service and the two Church groups Judge Carter dropped the church groups as defendants in 1982 although this did not exempt them from responding to the plaintiffs demands for internal documents reflecting plans for antiabortion activities contacts with political candidates and relationships between church entities and antiabortion groups Although the two Catholic groups based their Supreme Court appeal solely on the argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing they previously said Judge Carters order threatened their religious liberty because compliance would expose sensitive internal matters to public view Seven other major religious organizations including the National Council of Churches the National Association of Evangelicals and the Mormon Church filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting the Catholic groups appeal and raising similar concerns

Life in the 30's,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/09/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,I REMEMBER the first time I smoked marijuana It was a summer night and I was 19 years old I was a passenger in a Volkswagen I believe that most first drug experiences during the 1970s took place in Volkswagens and we were driving down a back road redolent of honeysuckle and manure The effects of the drug were that I lost all feeling in my tongue and developed a maniacal craving for French toast I would fail the reefer test This is not as devastating as it might have been I have given no serious thought to taking a place on the Supreme Court and I dont plan to run for political office at least not while Im in full possession of my faculties But I suppose given my age that various people suspect that I once used drugs Certainly last month when smoking marijuana was news topic of the week I was asked my opinion on the matter so often that I began to understand how Henry Kissinger must feel when there is trouble in the Persian Gulf Now however the dust has settled Judge Anthony M Kennedy has passed the reefer test and can be questioned next week about important matters And it occurs to me that I have never heard as much selfserving silly nonsense in my life as I have heard about recreational drug use since Judge Douglas H Ginsburg was booted out of contention for the Supreme Court and Judge Kennedy was booted in Im not talking about Edwin Meeses turning his ideological pockets inside out to explain away the turn of events finally complaining You tell me that no one appointed to the Supreme Court has ever broken a law Im not even talking about the investigation of whether the reefer madness took place while Judge Ginsburg was in his impressionable 20s or his shouldhaveknownbetter 30s Meanwhile the substantive question  whether he should have handled a cabletelevision case for the Government while he had investment holdings in a cable company  faded into the background like the Cheshire cat leaving only the marijuana smile The sorriest thing was that no one liberal or conservative tried to catalyze public discussion over the reality of this matter That reality simply stated is that there is a considerable difference between occasional recreational use of soft drugs and drug abuse Since we like to make everyone either saint or sinner we prefer to take a monolithic line drug use of any kind is wrong In the past this led to the wellknown parental theory that the joint was the first step to the needle which has proven nonsense in most cases including my own Even today it is a common belief that drug use must stop at the threshold level In theory this is probably a good idea smoking marijuana tends to make you fuzzy and I think most adolescents are fuzzy enough as it is But in practice we have to deal with our perceptions of a generation that has already used drugs For people of Judge Ginsburgs generation and my own  there was a fairly common set of circumstances some parties perhaps the occasional evening in front of the stereo with the Stones or Vivaldi some friends and a joint At a certain point you have children long working hours a life that is sadly too busy for parties and the Stones and certainly too busy to keep track of where you put the rolling papers You start to work out watch the cholesterol At 19 you think youre going to live forever At 35 you know damn well you wont Maybe its better if you dont smoke anything at all Certain drugs are still part of our lives but since they are legal we dont have to think of them that way Beaujolais nouveau beer Wild Turkey No one asked Judge Ginsburg if he had ever drunk so much that he could not remember what he had done the night before It would be nice to think that someone realized that the martini standard is as dumb as the reefer test But the real reason I believe it didnt come up is that America often conveniently forgets about alcohol in its zealotry over drugs Between a quarter and a third of all Americans in recent polls said that alcohol had seriously affected their lives and their families Only 9 percent said that was true of other drugs We accept that a stiff drink in the evening doesnt inevitably lead to alcoholism and we need to accept that the occasional use of marijuana doesnt inevitably lead to drug abuse Perhaps what we also need to accept is that if were concerned about threshold levels we should be raising our children to be teetotalers Im not a teetotaler And Ive smoked marijuana Nowadays it seems Im supposed to stand behind the lectern and say I didnt like it and I regret it If smoking marijuana lost me a job Id dreamed of all my life as it did for Judge Ginsburg maybe I would regret it But right now I dont I do regret some things Ive done during my life  lies Ive told people Ive hurt  but not occasional social drug use At the time I enjoyed it For me as for many of my friends relatives and acquaintances it was no big deal In the years to come there are going to be a lot of people in high places who grew up during a time when people were arrested for participating in demonstrations left the country to evade the draft had abortions and used drugs Some will be good people and some will be bad people Some of the good people will have used drugs And some of the bad people the ones who would drive a steamroller over an elderly person to get where they are going will be clean as a whistle Well need a standard by which to judge all these people The reefer test isnt it
Krol Will Retire As Archbishop Of Philadelphia,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/09/us/krol-will-retire-as-archbishop-of-philadelphia.html,John Cardinal Krol a onetime meatcutter who became one of the most influential prelates of the Roman Catholic Church announced today that he would retire Feb 11 as Archbishop of Philadelphia  Bishop Anthony J Bevilacqua of Pittsburgh has been named by Pope John Paul II to succeed Cardinal Krol Bishop Bevilacqua is a Brooklyn native the son of Italian immigrants who previously served as chancellor and chief canon lawyer of the Diocese of Brooklyn As Archbishop of the Diocese of Philadelphia the nations sixth largest for more than 26 years Cardinal Krol in matters of church doctrine developed a reputation as one of the most conservative and orthodox American bishops The views of Bishop Bevilacqua are regarded as compatible with those of Cardinal Krol Role in Election of Pope Cardinal Krol who is 77 years old said that he was stepping down as Archbishop of Philadelphia because of his age Philadelphia deserves much better service than I am able to give at this stage of my life the forceful and sometimes sharptongued Archbishop said at a news conference He is regarded as having played a pivotal role in the election of the Pope a close friend with whom he shares strong ties of both belief and background Pope John Paul is Polish and Cardinal Krol is a PolishAmerican with many bonds to the old country And they share a common opposition to a loosening of church doctrine on such matters as sexuality birth control and abortion a stance that puts them at loggerheads with many Catholics in America Cardinal Krol has displayed a robustness of unapologetic traditionalism backed up by intelligence shrewdness and influence that will not be easily filled by anybody else in the American church Dr Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University in Chicago a former priest who is recognized as an authority on the church hierarchy in America said today Stronger Supporter of Rome The 64yearold Bishop Bevilacqua who today described himself as an orthodox Catholic was described by Dr Kennedy as a strongly traditional Roman loyalist who has already demonstrated that he will give strong support to the centralization again of authority in Rome In accordance with church law Cardinal Krol submitted his resignation as Archbishop when he turned 75 two years ago Such pro forma resignations are not always accepted immediately Last May he underwent extensive surgery for varicose veins in the esophagus and there were fears at the time that he might not survive The good Lord spared my life this past spring he said today As long as he continues to spare me I shall try to repay him and his people the people of the Philadelphia community by continued service He said he would remain here during his retirement Theyd have to drive me out of Philadelphia to get me out he said Cardinal Krols influence in the Vatican is unlikely to diminish much with his retirement said Father Richard McBrien chairman of the theology department at Notre Dame University and another authority on the church hierarchy His relationship with Pope John Paul II is personal its not simply professional Although he will not have a pastoral base he will still have the influence that is born of mutual trust and respect I would say that his voice will still count as long as his mental and physical power hold out Break With Past Cardinal Krol was born in Cleveland the fourth of eight children of John and Anne Pietruszka Krol For two years after high school he worked as a meatcutter and manager of a Kroger chain store in Cleveland He spent his entire priestly career in that city until rising steadily in the hierarchy he was named to head the Philadelphia archdiocese on Feb 11 1961 27 years to the day from when he is to relinqish the post Despite his unwaveringly orthodox position on central matters of faith and morals Cardinal Krol has taken progressive stands on other issues He has been for example an outspoken opponent of nuclear weapons and armaments in general In 1979 testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he declared that spending money on arms was a crime against God and man Ignoring of Church Teachings After the announcement today Bishop Bevilacqua said he recognized that many American Catholics were ignoring some church teachings We have to be patient with that he said but without changing our teaching Bishop Bevilacqua has said earlier Objectively birth control  and certainly abortion  is a moral evil Homosexuality is wrong It cannot be countenanced As the 8th of 11 children of Italian immigrants Bishop Bevilacqua has argued for a more liberal Government stance on the admission of immigrants from countries in political turmoil
WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Questions for Judge,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/11/us/washington-talk-briefing-questions-for-judge.html,Liberals have long accused the Reagan Administration of seeking to pack the Federal courts with antiabortion conservatives and of privately grilling prospective nominees on their views about disputed issues to make sure they subscribe to the Reagan social agenda Administration denials have met with some skepticism by Democrats With this in mind the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Joseph R Biden Jr plans to question Judge Anthony M Kennedy President Reagans Supreme Court nominee carefully in hearings next week about his prenomination chats with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and other Administration officials In fact Judge Kennedy has already given a concise answer A long questionnaire from the Judiciary Committee included a twopart question asking him 1 whether anyone involved in selecting him had seemed to be seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on any specific case legal issue or question and 2 to list each communication he had in the six months before the Nov 11 announcement of his nomination with any member of the White House staff the Justice Department or the Senate or its staff referring or relating to your views on any case issue or subject that could come before the United States Supreme Court The nominees answers were 1 No 2 None But an aide said Senator Biden wanted to explore the matter further in public session with the judge under oath Some liberal groups note that the questionnaire did not inquire into any general discussions of judicial philosophy Such discussions they say can provide insights into a prospective nominees views on particular issues The liberals also say that if Administration officials looked only at his published judicial opinions and speeches they could have gleaned little about the judges views on key issues about which the officials must have been curious including abortion affirmative action and churchstate relations
U.S. BISHOPS BACK CONDOM EDUCATION AS A MOVE ON AIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/11/us/us-bishops-back-condom-education-as-a-move-on-aids.html,The nations Roman Catholic bishops longtime opponents of artificial birth control yesterday offered qualified support for teaching about condoms in educational programs aimed at fighting the spread of AIDS In their first major statement on the disease the bishops emphasized We are not promoting the use of prophylactics but merely providing information that is part of the factual picture The only morally correct and medically sure ways to prevent AIDS the bishops said are abstinence outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage as well as the avoidance of intravenous drug abuse Teaching About Condoms They said their position that teaching about condoms could at times be appropriate even in Catholic schools was an acknowledgment that some people will not act as they can and should The statement was released in Washington by the 50member Administrative Board of the United States Catholic Conference which represents the nations 300 Catholic bishops Carl Eifert a spokesman for the conference said the administrative board had the power to speak for the bishops between its annual meetings As a general rule the bishops conference which is charged with applying the teachings of the church to the particular needs of its constituents informs the Vatican in advance of the positions it is going to take It could not be learned last night whether the statement on condoms had Vatican clearance The 30page position paper on AIDS The Many Faces of AIDS A Gospel Response was prepared over the last nine months by a committee headed by Bishop William Hughes of Covington Ky [ Excerpts page D17 ] Prevention of AIDS The paper calls on Catholic schools around the nation  from elementary schools to colleges and seminaries  to develop materials to teach about AIDS prevention The role that condoms can play in preventing AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be included in these courses as long as it was presented within the framework of Catholic moral teaching according to the Rev Thomas G Gallagher an adviser to the bishops who helped draft the document The bishops are also interested in influencing the broader public noting in their statement that they felt moved out of a responsibility as religious leaders to bring analysis to bear upon the moral dimensions of public policy Father Gallagher who is secretary for education for the bishops conference said that the statement in no way diluted the bishops opposition to artificial birth control rather he said it involved a choice between two evils We are saying that we dont like this idea at all he said of condoms but we know that ignorance about this matter could cause death Our position is a toleration of a lesser evil to prevent a greater evil In the paper the bishops also repeatedly call for compassion toward those suffering from the disease oppose mandatory testing for the AIDS virus reject calls that AIDS patients be quarantined and urge those in health care professions to be mindful of their general moral obligation The bishops state firmly that they oppose the approaches to AIDS prevention that involve the socalled safe sex methods such as condoms which do not involve the exchange of bodily fluids This avenue compromises human sexuality  making it safe to be promiscuous  and in fact is quite misleading the statement says It is within a discussion of living within a pluralistic society that the bishops give qualified approval to teaching about condoms In such situations they say educational efforts if grounded in the broader moral vision outlined above could include accurate information about prophylactic devices or other practices proposed by some medical experts as potential means of preventing AIDS The statement drew praise from organizations involved in AIDS education B J Stiles executive director of the National Leadership Conference on AIDS in Washington praised the bishops for fashioning a compassionate nonjudgmental response to the crisis He said it would help Catholics understand the enormous challenge of AIDS to all of us Criticism by Conservative The statement was condemned however by one conservative Catholic who leads an antiabortion organization Its atrocious said Judie Brown president of the American Life League which is based in Stafford Va Roman Catholic teaching against artificial contraception is as clear as a bell The bishops are confusing Catholics once again Mrs Brown criticized the bishops as falling down on the job since opposition to artificial birth control was affirmed in a 1968 encyclical by Pope Paul VI called Humanae Vitae The American bishops who once took strong positions against providing contraceptive services as part of United States foreign aid packages have not spoken as forcefully about birth control in recent years In their more recent public statements on sexual issues they have tended to emphasize the churchs opposition to abortion and homosexual practice One Catholic liberal who follows the activities of the bishops said that he was surprised by the bishops statement on condoms This reflects a pastoral acknowledgement of the real world said Eugene Kennedy a professor of psychology at Loyola University in Chicago You dont often find that in statements connected with human sexuality In most of their public statements he said the bishops reflect a commitment to high ideals while they are far more pastoral in administering to the people of the church Use of Contraceptives Public opinion polls including a New York TimesCBS News survey released in September just before the visit to the United States of Pope John Paul II indicate that a majority of American Catholics reject Vatican teaching that forbids the use of artificial contraception The bishops position on teaching about condoms was somewhat unexpected because they took a very strong stand at their annual meeting last month against schoolbased clinics that distribute condoms as well as information on teenage pregnancy and AIDS In a resolution passed overwhelmingly the bishops objected to the clinics on both moral and practical grounds The latest statement on AIDS Father Gallagher said was not ready to be presented to the full conference when it met last month in Washington Consistency Is Defended He said that the new document was consistent with the old since one rejected the distribution of condoms while the other gave license to teach about their use within a moral context The drafters of the new document worked very long and hard to hammer out the language on the appropriate way to teach about condoms he said and were well aware that it could be misinterpreted by those who were looking for a change in the bishops opposition to contraception He underscored the documents specific rejection of the use of prophylactics and pointed to the words that sum up the section on education Socalled safesex practices are at best only partially effective the document says They do not take into account either the real values that are at stake or the fundamental good of the human person The paper was prepared by Bishop Hughes together with three other members of the bishops conference Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago Bishop Raymond W Lessard of Savannah Ga and Bishop Anthony G Bosco of Greensburg Pa
Article 669687 -- No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/12/business/article-669687-no-title.html,A Federal judge said yesterday that the A H Robins Company must set aside about 25 billion in its bankruptcy reorganization plan to compensate the women injured by its Dalkon Shield birthcontrol device The estimate by Judge Robert Merhige Jr of the United States District Court in Richmond is more than double the sum Robins said would be needed at a hearing last month but far less than the 4 billion to 7 billion range suggested by claimants Robins said it would try to meet the demands of Judge Merhige who has not issued his written ruling Average Compensation Matched Attorneys for claimants said the ruling meant that tens of thousands of women stood a good chance of eventually collecting compensation comparable to the average amounts received by 9500 women with similar injuries who sued before Robins filed for protection under the bankruptcy law in August 1985 The higher sums the attorneys had sought reflected the great uncertainties involved in the estimating The claimants say they suffered infertility spontaneous abortions and other injuries from pelvic infections linked to the intrauterine device which Robins sold in the early 1970s Judge Merhiges ruling could mark a turning point in the long and bitter IUD case which lawyers for claimants describe as the biggest test of an otherwise healthy corporations ability to protect itself from a flood of personal injury litigation by filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code The ruling was delivered after concerted efforts to reach a negotiated agreement had failed Family Owns 41 of Stock The ruling raises the prospect that the Richmondbased maker of Robitussin cough medicine and Chap Stick lip balm will be forced to accept a reorganization that all but wipes out the value of the holdings of the Robins family which owns 41 percent of the company and outside shareholders We wholeheartedly support his ruling said Guerry R Thornton Jr counsel to the Atlantabased Dalkon Shield Victims Association This estimate proves that you cannot do an end run around liability by going to bankruptcy Robins has repeatedly described the bankruptcy as the only available strategy for determining and meeting all its liabilities in a fair and orderly way It faces nearly 200000 claims in the bankruptcy proceeding but the company and claimants agree that many women will receive token sums at best because their injuries were minor or because they lack proof connecting those injuries to the Dalkon Shield The company said it was too soon to comment on how it would revise its reorganization plan which allocates 177 billion to claims against the company and its officers Robins said the fund included a 500 million cushion over its projected needs of 12 billion Robins had estimated that interest earned by that fund would have provided more than 2 billion to claimants The judge is expected to lay down time limits for a response to his ruling at a meeting with attorneys next Thursday Robins was joined in its statement by the Rorer Group a drug company based in Fort Washington Pa that has agreed to acquire Robins in a deal valued at 265 billion That deal was linked to acceptance of the Robins reorganization plan which would have left the Robins family and other shareholders with about 700 million More Than 5000 Lawsuits When Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection it faced more than 5000 lawsuits related to the intrauterine device From 1971 to 1974 Robins sold an estimated 27 million Dalkon Shields in the United States and up to a million more overseas Critics said that the Dalkon Shields design resulted in bacteria being drawn into the normally germfree womb Robins has continued to deny that the Dalkon Shield was any more dangerous than other intrauterine devices and attributes most of the problems linked to it to sexually transmitted diseases Until 1984 it rejected calls to mount a campaign urging women to remove their shields Judge Merhiges ruling was based on expert testimony last month It concluded the most comprehensive effort to date in a bankruptcy court to estimate the value of a great number of uncertain claims The estimation effort is one of several aspects of the bankruptcy case that could eventually be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and then the Supreme Court Attorneys doubt that the case will be resolved in the next year Delay Seen Raising Payments Lawyers for parties in the case said several key issues in Judge Merhiges terse ruling were unclear For example representatives of claimants said the rulings figure of 2475 billion was based on a current number and would have to be higher if some of the payments were much delayed Robins and representatives of its shareholders said Judge Merhiges requirement that the money be paid out over a reasonable period of time suggested that a large portion of the payments might not be needed for several years making the necessary sum somewhat less than 2475 billion in current dollars There are different models we are trying said James C Roberts a lawyer who has represented Robins in the hearings There was an opportunity for the judge to have said so if he thought the sevenyear period of time in our current plan was unreasonable Moreover Robins and Rorer are hopeful that other parties such as the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company will be willing to provide substantial sums to be part of a settlement Aetna is a codefendent in thousands of pending suits against Robins The insurance company said yesterday that it could not say what its future role might be Not the End of Equity Judge Merhiges number is disappointing but its not surprising to us said Robert Miller an attorney with the New York firm of Berlack Israels  Liberman who has represented outside shareholders This doesnt mean the end of equity The outside equity interests include substantial investments by speculators who stand to lose millions of dollars Michael Steinhardt the head of Steinhardt Partners an investment fund holds more than 8 percent of the Robins shares  more than two million in all  acquired at an average cost of more than 21 according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission George Soros manager of the Quantam Fund holds more than 5 percent with the last acquisition made at an average cost of 19 a share Robins shares ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at 1425 down 150 Robins has operated profitably during its two years in bankruptcy It reported earnings of 632 million on sales of 621 million for the nine months ended Sept 30

THE NATION; Leaderless Conservatives Approach '88 in Splinters,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/13/weekinreview/the-nation-leaderless-conservatives-approach-88-in-splinters.html,A WEEK in which the hammer and sickle was flying in front of the White House is not a bad time to contemplate the dismay and disarray that grips much of the American conservative movement Leaving aside the armscontrol agreement with the Soviet Union  and for many conservatives thats bad enough  the movement is in a decidedly bad humor Conservatives are worried about many things who will lead them after Ronald Reagan what issues they can use to rally the electorate whether the very language of conservatism is becoming too arcane a tongue for most tastes The crisis of leadership may be the most wrenching Ronald Reagan has been the movements hero since 1964 when he gave a stirring television speech supporting Barry Goldwaters Presidential race Edwin J Feulner Jr the president of the Heritage Foundation a conservative research group noted that Mr Reagan was the conservatives choice in the elections of 1968 1976 1980 and 1984 For many conservatives thinking about their movement without Mr Reagan is like thinking about Gaullism without De Gaulle There is no apparent successor much to the disappointment of Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York Mr Kemp who shares Mr Reagans politics as well as his desire to appeal to onceDemocratic bluecollar voters has failed to unite the movement many ardent conservatives indeed have defected to Vice President Bush You have nothing even faintly resembling unanimity within the ranks said Eddie Mahe a Republican consultant Mr Feulner for one thinks that what many conservatives view as a problem is actually a sign of success After all one of the major reasons why conservatives are so scattered in the Presidential race is that even the Republican moderates Mr Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole take conservative stances on almost everything But such an upbeat view of events is of little solace to people who two years ago were relishing a successful Reagan revolution For Allan C Carlson president of the conservative Rockford Institute the revolution died the day the Democrats ousted the Republicans from control of the Senate The triumphalism came to a crashing halt in November of 1986 and its been worse ever since Mr Carlson said Among other things loss of the Senate led to the defeat conservatives have taken hardest and it seems most personally the rejection of Judge Robert H Borks nomination to the Supreme Court The result is recrimination  at times the fights among conservatives are reminiscent of the sectarian battles that have torn apart so many Marxist political parties Social conservatives fight libertarians supplysiders fight the followers of Milton Friedman longtime conservatives fight neoconservatives Howard Phillips the president of the Conservative Caucus angered many of his fellow conservatives by calling Mr Reagan a useful idiot for Kremlin propaganda borrowing a phrase reportedly used by Lenin the most successful sectarian infighter of them all in reference to liberals Beyond Mr Phillipss outburst many conservatives see what Representative Newt Gingrich a Georgia Republican called a tendency among conservatives to want to commit fratricide Irrelevant Arguments Gary L Bauer assistant to the President for policy development said that he was worried that conservative arguments appear irrelevant to the problems average Americans face on a daytoday basis He added They are not interested at all if the Austrian school of economic theory is more correct than supplyside economics Many in the conservative movement blame the Republicans loss of the Senate in 1986 not on an obsession with obscure issues but on the fact that so many of the partys candidates ran entirely issueless campaigns But it is not clear what issues conservatives can pick up on in the current climate  in part because they have already won victories for many of their most popular causes They have cut taxes They have increased military spending to such a point that support for more is dropping Old conservative standbys such as opposition to busing for school integration are hardly issues any more Moreover many groups drawn to the Reagan coalition on the social issues  the opponents of abortion

Mr Bauer is the last movement conservative with a key White House position and that alone is enough to trouble the faithful Mr Bauer understands the angst of his allies even as he speaks stoically about the ordeals of power Washington is better at gridlock than it is at quick action he said and a lot of conservatives are frustrated because there are things that did not happen But as the Soviet flags flapped in the wind it was the thing that did happen that many conservatives were vociferously protesting the arms control agreement reached not by the liberal enemy but by the man they thought

What A. H. Robins Has Wrought,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/13/business/what-a-h-robins-has-wrought.html,AT a time when companies are increasingly filing for bankruptcy to shield themselves from litigation Fridays landmark ruling in the A H Robins case may give executives and lawyers second thoughts about such a strategy In the ruling Judge Robert Merhige Jr of United States District Court in Richmond held that the tens of thousands of injury claims filed against the A H Robins Company by women who said they were injured by its Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth control device were worth nearly 248 billion Judge Merhiges estimate  which came after the two sides in the case failed to reach an agreement  will make it difficult for Robins to come up with a reorganization that preserves any of the companys value for shareholders It shows that bankruptcy is not an easy solution to a difficult problem said Dennis Drebsky the bankruptcy lawyer with the New York firm of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher  Flom that represents Robins It may prove to be the fairest way to deal with an insoluble problem of hundreds of cases all over the nation but its no shortcut Judge Merhiges ruling in the case a suit seen as the biggest test yet of the bankruptcy tactic to avoid personal injury litigation highlighted a pivotal issue in bankruptcy law Can a judge estimate and put a cap on a companys total liabilities when so many of them are a matter of dispute It is not clear yet whether the estimate will touch off a new round of disputes negotiations or appeals in the bankruptcy case But whatever happens the judges ruling will be added to a growing string of decisions and events in the case that are expected to leave a lasting legal impact Already the Robins suit has been widely noted for breaking ground in how bankruptcy law interacts with the rest of the court system how classes of claimants are organized and how companies are managed during bankruptcy The case is expected to tackle other farreaching issues as it continues One crucial question Can the reorganization of a company like Robins  a company facing thousands of lawsuits  offer enough protection to codefendants for them to be willing to contribute to the payments of claimants Robins is on the cutting edge of developing bankruptcy law said George Treaster a leading bankruptcy lawyer and partner in the Los Angeles firm of Stutman Treaster  Glatt Bankruptcy was once viewed as the ultimate corporate disaster In recent years however companies with problems ranging from asbestos liability the Manville Corporation and expensive labor contracts Continental Airlines to a multibilliondollar judgment Texaco have turned to Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code Their goal to pursue business as usual and preserve the interests of shareholders and management while settling the particular conflict gnawing away at their resources Chapter 11 stops what lawyers call the race to the courthouse by those to whom a company owes money All claims by creditors  in Robinss case they are mostly people who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield  are put on hold Then the company is given time to propose a solution to its problems that in theory allows it to treat all creditors fairly Any leftover resources go to the shareholders and the company is allowed to start over with a clean financial slate But theory has been a poor guide to the A H Robins bankruptcy case The case has its roots in the companys rush in the early 1970s to take the lead in the market for intrauterine devices or IUDs American women bought some 27 million of the companys Dalkon Shields from 1971 to 1974 when Robins stopped making the device Women overseas got perhaps 1 million Robins made 10 million in profits from the device By 1985 when it filed for protection under Chapter 11 Robins and Aetna Casualty  Surety its insurer had disposed of 9500 injury suits at a cost of 530 million more than 5200 suits were pending and new ones were coming in at the rate of 400 a month The proud Robins family revered for its civic mindedness in Richmond is fighting hard to preserve a stake in its 120yearold business In this it is allied though not always comfortably with outside investors including Wall Street speculators like George Soros who manages the Quantam Fund and Michael Steinhardt both of whom are determined to minimize their losses On the other side are lawyers for claimants in the Dalkon Shield litigation many of whom have been battling Robins for years They want enough funds set aside to compensate their clients and the tens of thousands of other women whose injuries have yet to be determined In the middle are codefendants in the suit such as Aetna Joining them is the Rorer Group a Ft Washington Pa pharmaceutical company that has agreed to provide most of the compensation fund and acquire Robins in a deal valued at 26 billion once it emerges from bankruptcy This case is more a matter of emotion than economics more a matter of tort law than bankruptcy law said Robert Miller a bankruptcy expert at the New York firm of Berlack Israels  Liberman Mr Miller represents Robins shareholders other than the Robins family which still owns 41 percent of the company The case is the first bankruptcy reorganization for Judge Merhige who had 400 Dalkon Shield cases on his docket when Robins filed for protection The spry 68yearold is best known for presiding over battles such as the desegregation of Richmonds schools and Westinghouses abrogation of contracts to supply nuclear fuel in the mid1970s Blackwell Shelley a Federal bankruptcy judge is advising him but according to lawyers he is having little impact on the judges freewheeling style That style has generated its own controversies  and possible precedents Some claimants say Judge Merhige has favored Robins particularly in refusing to appoint a trustee to take control of the company from E Claiborne Robins Sr the chairman E Claiborne Robins Jr his son and chief executive officer and entrenched managers  even after he cited the company for contempt in making illegal payments to officers preferred creditors and the local United Way Other participants say that the profitable performance of Robins  best known for its Robitussin cough medicine and Chap Stick lip balm  justifies the judges forbearance Whatever the wisdom of the judge lawyers say that the claimants failure to get him to appoint a trustee  and to force the judge to withdraw from the case  is an encouraging precedent for management teams that resort to bankruptcy to fight mass torts  lawsuits based on claims of personal injury THE Robins case has also confirmed a bankruptcy courts power to stop related litigation in order to protect a companys assets and free its management to concentrate on the bankruptcy The Fourth Circuit agreed with Judge Merhige that all other actions are automatically stayed said Frank J Kennedy professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Law School They went even farther than the court in Manville Indeed thousands of related lawsuits including some against company officers and other individuals and companies involved with the IUD have ground to a halt in courts around the nation with the filing of the bankruptcy This suspension of activity has allowed all parties to concentrate on seeking an overall solution to all Dalkon Shield litigation in the context of Robinss reorganization One of the major unsettled questions in the case though is whether the bankruptcy law is flexible enough to achieve this The law is clear that only the debtor before the court can be discharged of obligations in a reorganization But most participants in the Robins case believe that an enforceable agreement could be reached in which Aetna and others would contribute substantial sums to the Robins compensation fund Under such an agreement women collecting from the fund through the streamlined claims procedure would be required to grant other parties a release from further claims at the same time Otherwise they would have to go through the delay and trauma of a fullscale court case to collect from the fund However the parties have yet to reach such an agreement That is why Judge Merhige was forced to make his ruling on the value of the claims  a ruling that has brought the issue of estimation to the fore Judge Merhige heard six days of expert testimony on the claims value last month most of it based on data from a 50page questionnaire sent to a random sampling of more than 6000 claimants His 248 billion figure was more than 700 million higher than Robins offered in its plan and 12 billion more than it predicted would be needed though well below the 4 billion to 7 billion range projected by the claimants experts But more than the figures are in question It is not certain that the United States Constitution allows for a judge to make a group estimate of claims such as those of Dalkon Shield users who say they suffered varying injuries such as infertility birth defects spontaneous abortions and traumatic infections The shield has also been blamed for more than 20 deaths A tougher question is whether Judge Merhige arrived at his estimation in a constitutional manner Because the bankruptcy law was not written with mass torts in mind it offers no guidance on how the court is to communicate with such a huge class of potential creditors In the Robins case it is estimated that more than 150000 of the nearly 200000 women who have active claims on file in Richmond are not represented by lawyers and have heard little or nothing about what has occurred in the past two years Yet another unsettled question is how the parties will deal with the amendment to the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 that guarantees claimants with injuries the right to a jury trial in a regular court Unlike bankruptcy claims jury verdicts can include punitive damages Robinss latest plan offered to distribute leftover money from its compensation fund to successful claimants in lieu of punitive damages but both the legality and acceptability of such a suggestion have been questioned THE bankruptcy case most compared to the Robins case say lawyers is Manvilles which began in 1982 But the Manville case was simpler in that the court and most of the parties eventually agreed that the asbestos claims and other liabilities would be more than the value of the company As a result the court has approved a reorganization of Manville that left almost nothing for shareholders and created a 25 billion trust fund for asbestos claimants Moreover asbestos victims have the right to sue the surviving company if the fund is exhausted Because the fund was uncapped the claimants had little riding on the estimate used to create it The Robins estimation was more contentious because the company and its shareholders viewed it as a basis for capping their liability to the claimants They argued that the reasonable figure was comfortably below the 175 billion proposed in the reorganization plan which would have left the family and other shareholders with Rorer shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars following the Rorer takeover The claimants viewed the estimate as a method of confirming that the company should be taken from its shareholders in order to proceed with distribution of its assets to claimants and creditors Judge Merhige found himself confronted with as many questions as answers when he sat through the expert testimony The key to the estimation effort has been the assumptions that it is possible to make a reasonable guess  because no Dalkon Shields have been given to women for the past decade because most Dalkon Shields that were inserted have been removed and because women who might have been at risk from wearing them will soon be beyond their childbearing years Some critics argue that these assumptions are wrong They say that thousands of the devices were inserted in women living in developing countries after sales stopped that no one can estimate how many are still in place and that some wearers will be potential childbearers well into the next century Nevertheless the assumptions allowed the judge to make a crucial ruling that all injuries had been inflicted prior to Robinss petition for bankruptcy protection even if some were not yet known As a result the bankruptcy court could determine all potential Dalkon Shield liability and grant Robins a discharge from any further claims But the real world has proven to be a statistical mess More that 330000 claimants mailed their claims in response to advertisements early in the case That group was whittled to less than 200000 when many failed to fill out the twopage form the court sent in response By all accounts this group included thousands of duplicate fraudulent or mistaken claims as well as claims that might be valid but lacked proof There were also claims to which the company would have valid defenses The court turned to Francis E McGovern a masslitigation expert and law professor at the University of Alabama to set up the data pool from which each partys experts could estimate the distribution of likely claims Most observers have praised this effort as far as it has gone But it may take years of testing to see whether the key rulings in this bankruptcy case stand up There are so many interested parties so much money and so much emotion involved said Mr Bartlett of Rorer that it is our guess that someone will appeal this reorganization all the way to the Supreme Court
HEARINGS TO BEGIN FOR COURT NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/us/hearings-to-begin-for-court-nominee.html,Judge Anthony M Kennedy President Reagans third choice to fill a sevenmonthold Supreme Court vacancy goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday his first step on what appears to be an easy road to confirmation On the eve of Judge Kennedys confirmation hearings which are expected to take no longer than a week there is almost none of the passion that animated both the left and the right in the weeks of Senate debate over Mr Reagans first choice Judge Robert H Bork After the Senate rejected Judge Bork the President nominated Judge Douglas H Ginsburg who withdrew his name nine days later in the wake of disclosures that he had used marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s A Sense of Relief In place of passion there is a widespread sense of relief in both the Senate and the Administration that another bruising battle can be avoided There is abundant evidence that the sense of relief is well founded No senator has come out in opposition to Judge Kennedy The chairman of the Judiciary Committee Senator Joseph R Biden Jr a Delaware Democrat who was one of several key senators to announce early opposition to Judge Bork has declared the new nominees confirmation chances very good The American Bar Association committee that evaluates judicial nominees which was deeply split over Judge Bork unanimously gave its highest rating last week to Judge Kennedy who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California The major participants in the liberal coalition that worked to defeat Judge Bork have remained silent 32 Possible Witnesses While more than 100 witnesses testified at Judge Borks threeweek confirmation hearing only 32 people have asked to testify at Judge Kennedys hearing One of the scheduled witnesses on Judge Kennedys behalf is Prof Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School who delivered powerful testimony against Judge Bork but has praised Judge Kennedy as an openminded nonideological judicial craftsman Still the relief is tempered by caution born of the hardearned knowledge that the unforeseen can happen when the stakes are as high as they are with this vacancy The unforeseen looms larger than it otherwise might because relatively little is known about Judge Kennedys views on the questions that are at the forefront of current debate on the Constitution At stake in this nomination is the balance of power on a Supreme Court that is sharply divided on such questions as affirmative action abortion and the constitutional relationship between church and state Judge Kennedy despite 12 years on the Federal bench and nearly 500 opinions has no clear position on these issues Further he has expressed no sharply defined constitutional philosophy and no particular desire to arrive at one even observing in a speech last year that maintaining a zone of ambiguity about the way the Constitution allocates power might be a virtue in itself Some Deferring Judgment For that reason Judge Kennedys own testimony at his confirmation hearings has taken on an importance it might not otherwise have with most of the liberal groups that opposed Judge Bork deferring judgment on Judge Kennedy until after the hearings Among national civil rights organizations only the National Organization for Women has opposed Judge Kennedy citing several of his civil rights rulings as well as his past membership in clubs that do not accept women as members In some ways these hearings are even more important than the Bork hearings said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights You had the Bork record almost in total before the hearings began and he basically spent the hearings defending it By contrast Mr Neas said these hearings will be the principal forum for learning what Judge Kennedys views are Mr Neas and Benjamin L Hooks the chairman of the leadership conference said in a statement that while the conference has not taken a position on Judge Kennedys nomination they believe his judicial philosophy should be closely examined in the hearings We expect that the senators will have a lot of tough questions and well be waiting for the answers said Judith Lichtman executive director of the Womens Legal Defense Fund February Vote Planned Although the committee expects to conclude the hearings this week it will not vote until early February with the Senate planning to spend most of January in recess Senator Biden has said he will hold the hearing record open until the vote so that anyone who wants time to analyze the judges presentation can submit written testimony The Judiciary Committee members who voted against Judge Bork say they plan to hold Judge Kennedy to the same standard Phrased in various ways these are their basic questions Is he in the mainstream of judicial thought Does he view the Supreme Court as playing a crucial role in protecting individual rights Does he see the Constitution as embodying an evolving concept of liberty or is he committed to a search for the intent of the Constitutions 18thcentury framers In his speeches the 51yearold Judge Kennedy has said that applying the label conservative to his judicial philosophy is probably apt as a general rule He has expressed some skepticism about the extent to which the Constitution protects rights not spelled out in the text such as the right to privacy But he has not joined Judge Bork in flatly rejecting the concept of unenumerated rights and has also questioned whether the concept of original intent of which Judge Bork is a champion is sufficient as a theory of constitutional interpretation Not the Whole Loaf The ambiguity in Judge Kennedys record has left some conservatives still seething from the defeat of Judge Bork disheartened We cant get the whole loaf so were willing to take a piece said James McClellan director of the Center for Judicial Studies a conservative legal research organization with close ties to the Reagan Administration Asked whether he was enthusiastic about Judge Kennedy Mr McClellan replied Warm and added He doesnt have a judicial philosophy we can get our hands on The failure of the Bork nomination Mr McClellan said was a substantial major blow and well never recover from it His comments were echoed by others in the conservative legal movement Bork was perfect Kennedy is merely good said Michael P McDonald head of legal studies for the Washington Legal Foundation The consensus among conservatives is one of acceptance He predicted that senators who believe that their vote against Judge Bork left them politically vulnerable will want to rehabilitate themselves by saying that Kennedy is a real conservative  But he said conservatives were not yet fully persuaded Panel Expects Answers As a matter of political reality however Senate conservatives are virtually certain to support Judge Kennedy because should the nomination flounder the chance is remote that the Democratcontrolled Senate would even consider a fourth nominee for the vacancy before Mr Reagans term ends The Judiciary Committee members who questioned Judge Bork closely have told Judge Kennedy that they expect him to be willing to discuss his judicial philosophy They told him not to seek refuge in the stance taken by some former Supreme Court nominees who refused to discuss anything of substance on the ground that any constitutional question might someday become a Supreme Court case I told him there would never be another Scalia confirmed by the Senate Senator Patrick J Leahy a Vermont Democrat who is a member of the committee said in an interview His reference was to Justice Antonin Scalia whom the Senate confirmed unanimously last year despite several senators annoyance over his refusal to answer substantive questions at his confirmation hearing Senator Leahy said that Judge Kennedy said he understood and I think he did
New Attention Focused On Infant Organ Donors,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/us/new-attention-focused-on-infant-organ-donors.html,A novel use of an old technique is forcing new attention on one of the most wrenching issues in medicine the use of babies born without brains as organ donors Until now few of these babies have been used as donors because their organs deteriorate by the time they die Now in a radical departure doctors in Canada and California are experimenting with conventional lifesupport techniques such as respirators to maintain these babies organs while they are still alive One such baby is now on a respirator in a Canadian hospital Another diagnosed in its mothers womb is due to be born in California any day The parents Brenda and Michael Winner of Arcadia have persuaded physicians at the Loma Linda Medical Center the leading infant heart transplant center in the United States to maintain their baby on lifesupport equipment so that its organs can be donated In October doctors in Canada kept alive a baby born without most of her brain so that her heart might be salvaged for a transplant operation The donor named Gabrielle was flown to California where her heart was transplanted to Paul Holc an infant with a fatal heart defect Because doctors feared that Gabrielles organs would deteriorate even on a respirator Baby Paul was delivered early by Caesarean section to receive the heart Today he is doing well at his home in Vancouver Potential Boon for Thousands Each year several thousand babies are born in the United States and Canada with most of the brain missing a condition called anencephaly All die within hours or days of birth Experts in medical ethics say using their organs for transplant while a potential boon for thousands of other doomed infants raises profound moral and medical questions The central question ethicists say is whether it is morally defensible to prolong human life for the sole purpose of providing organs But there are other questions So little is known about the nervous system in newborns that there is no accepted definition of brain death in infants less than seven days old Brain death is even harder to assess in anencephalics who have intact brain stems but no cerebral cortex Some ethicists fear that a definition widened to include all anencephalic babies might be applied to children and adults who are braindamaged suggesting the specter of human organ farms Even suggesting such a change some ethicists fear would cause the public to lose confidence in the transplant system and envision it instead as a network of greedy doctors seeking a ready supply of organs 50 Requests a Year But these doubts are being countered on two fronts Parents of anencephalic babies inspired by publicity over infant transplant operations and eager to derive some meaning from a heartbreaking experience are demanding that their infants organs be used to save other infants The Loma Linda center said it had received more than 50 such requests this year Mrs Winners persistent pleas finally convinced hospital officials Also physicians who perform transplants say there is a shortage of organs for the very young Estimates are that 40 to 70 percent of the children under age two on transplant waiting lists die before donors can be found About two years ago amid rising publicity over organ transplants in infants several parents of anencephalic babies pressured lawmakers in California to amend the brain death laws to define anencephalic infants as dead said Dr Calvin Stiller chief of the multiorgan transplant service and professor of medicine at University Hospital in London Ontario This effort failed he said because lawmakers physicians and ethicists found it repugnant to remove organs from babies that were still breathing on their own In January Dr Stiller convened an international panel of transplant surgeons and medical ethicists to discuss the issue Their solution place the anencephalic infant on a respirator administer painkillers antibiotics and sustenance Every six hours remove the respirator to see if the infant can breathe on its own If the infant fails to breathe on its own for three minutes it is presumed brain dead Dr Stiller has treated four anencephalic infants in this way since October beginning with Baby Gabrielle In the second case Dr Stiller said the mother requested that the baby be kept on a respirator for no more than five days After five days the brain stem was not dead life support was withdrawn and the baby died a natural death 12 hours later But its organs had deteriorated Meanwhile a baby who would have received its heart died In the third instance the baby was delivered and within an hour was put on a respirator It was brain dead after one day said Dr Stiller and kept alive on the respirator for nine more days At that point when no recipient had been found the life support was cut off and the baby died The fourth baby is now being evaluated in the hospital LongTerm Success in Doubt Because transplants involving infants are a recent development and because the use of organs from anencephalics is even newer their longterm success has yet to be established Both the respirator treatment and organ transplantation are highly experimental in newborns and infants said Arthur Caplan chairman of the bioethics program at the University of Minnesota In newborns there have been only nine heart transplants and four kidney transplants There have been no liver transplants It is also not known if anencephalic infants can experience pain or if putting them on life support could prolong their lives by somehow encouraging brainstem function that would not otherwise exist a fear that so far seems unfounded The ethical issues are even more troublesome said Professor Caplan Is it acceptable to put a baby on life support solely for the purpose of harvesting its organs Should we allow medicine to use its technologies not to save lives but to increase the chance of finding organ donors How long should the newborn be kept on the respirator We have a situation of organs chasing recipients Professor Caplan said Mrs Winner was five and half months pregnant when she underwent a sonogram and learned that her baby had no brain The couple was opposed to abortion Pressed Officials for Months When we found out about the baby that was devastating enough said Mrs Winner But when we discovered that the organs would all be healthy and normal and that babies who need a liver or heart couldnt get them well thats when we started getting into it For several months Mrs Winner has pressed doctors and health officials to allow her to donate her babys organs Fearing criticism no hospital in the area would agree to deliver the Winner baby and place it on a respirator according to the couples obstetrician Dr Suvannee Vidhyapum On Thursday evening physicians at Loma Linda agreed to work with the Winners Up to half of all anencephalic babies are stillborn said Dr Joyce Peabody chief of the neonatology division at Loma Linda If the baby survives birth it might not meet brain death criteria before a predetermined sevenday waiting period is up Its organs might not be viable Suitable recipients might not be available Mrs Winner knows all the scenarios said Dr Peabody But she has already made a major contribution by getting us brave enough to face this issue head on The hospital has decided to work with five anencephalic babies and then evaluate the effect on parents and staff But parents must not be given unrealistic hopes Dr Stiller said We may find that after l0 or 20 of these experiments that it is not worth the anguish he said But I have been moved by the pleas of these mothers to redeem their pregnancies
Judge Kennedy Says Rights Are Not Always Spelled Out,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/15/us/judge-kennedy-says-rights-are-not-always-spelled-out.html,In his first day of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee today Judge Anthony M Kennedy cautiously endorsed the view that the Constitution protects some rights that are not spelled out in the text The Supreme Court nominee said the Constitution establishes a zone of liberty a zone of protection for individual privacy against intrusion by the Government Although his language was oblique Judge Kennedy distanced himself from the position taken by the Presidents first choice for the vacancy Judge Robert H Bork who maintained that because the Constitution does not mention the right to privacy the Supreme Court acted illegitimately when it found such a right A Sigh of Relief Choosing his words with care Judge Kennedy steered a deft course through the committee members early questioning in a session that lacked the tension and drama of the Bork hearings He appeared to avoid the pitfalls and pressure points on which Judge Bork had stumbled leading one Democratic member of the committee Senator Patrick J Leahy of Vermont to comment in a recess The White House must be breathing a sigh of relief right now that can be heard all the way to Peoria Judge Kennedy got a cordial reception from both Democrats and Republicans In fact the senators sparred more with each other than with the lowkey nominee who answered their questions in slow deliberate tones laced at times with humor In the last few weeks most of my thoughts have been about how to get on the Supreme Court not how to get off it he said at one point to Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina who asked about amending the Constitution to provide a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court Justices In five hours of testimony that ranged from the nuances of judicial philosophy to the details of past rulings to his membership in private clubs that excluded women Judge Kennedy avoided some difficult issues He said he had not taken a position on whether the death penalty was constitutional He said he had no particular fixed views on whether Congress should be permitted to bring a lawsuit if it believes one of its laws was not being properly enforced He sidestepped a question on what standards he would use deciding whether to overrule Roe v Wade the Supreme Court decision establishing abortion as a constitutional right Of Text and Justice It was in his discussion of how a judge interprets the Constitution that the most complete picture of his thinking emerged Even there the picture was a blurred one as the nominee avoided ringing statements in favor of introspective commentary on what he called the great tension the great debate the great duality in constitutional law The debate he said was between what the text says and what the dictates of the particular case seem to require from the standpoint of justice and from the standpoint of our constitutional tradition In a dialogue with the committees chairman Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware Judge Kennedy said the Constitutions framers intended the word liberty to be a spacious phrase One of the framers central ideas he said was There is a zone of liberty a zone of protection a line thats drawn where the individual can tell the Government Beyond this line you may not go Now the great question of constitutional law is one where is that line drawn And two what are the principles that you refer to in drawing that line Drawing the Line But there is a line Senator Biden interjected There is a line the nominee replied Its wavering its amorphous its uncertain But this is the judicial function Mr Biden a leading opponent of Judge Bork appeared satisfied with Judge Kennedys answers The Senator was particularly pleased by the nominees response to a question about the Ninth Amendment a littleused amendment providing that rights not spelled out in the Constitution may nonetheless be retained by the people Mr Bidens question Could you tell me what the Ninth Amendment means to you was a heavily freighted moment because judicial liberals view the amendment as a theoretical foundation for an expansive view of constitutional rights Judge Bork by contrast derogated the Ninth Amendment as a waterblot on the Constitution with no real meaning Judge Kennedy said that when James Madison drafted the Bill of Rights he wanted to assure that the world understood that he did not have the capacity to foresee every verbal formulation that was necessary for the protection of the individual Judge Kennedy said the Ninth Amendment served Madisons purpose by demonstrating that the Constitution need not be viewed as a proclamation of every right that should be the right of the free people With a smile Mr Biden told the nominee Judge I dont want to hurt your prospects any but I happen to agree with you Issue of Original Intent Senator Charles E Grassley an Iowa Republican who is one of the committees more conservative members looked considerably less pleased at the end of a somewhat parallel series of questions on the doctrine of original intent This approach to constitutional interpretation of which Judge Bork and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d are leading exponents holds that the intent of the Constitutions framers is the only legitimate guide to solving current constitutional problems Any theory which is predicated on the intent of the framers having reference to what they actually thought about is just not helpful Judge Kennedy said He added that an inquiry into what the framers might have thought about a modern problem they could not have foreseen doesnt seem to me very helpful either Rather he said the search for original intent is a necessary starting point rather than a methodology for constitutional decisionmaking It doesnt tell us how to decide a case he added Mr Grassley asked Judge Kennedy what he meant when he described himself in a 1984 speech as a conservative A conservative recognizes that any state must contain within it the ability to change in order to preserve those values that a conservative deems essential the nominee replied Hearings Resume Today Judge Kennedy will return Tuesday for what is scheduled as a final day of testimony From the moment the hearing opened this morning the contrast between this proceeding and the threeweeklong hearing for Judge Bork three months ago was apparent Then the Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building was jammed Today there were empty seats in the sections for both press and public In place of the tension even anger that the Judiciary Committee members displayed then there were jibes today some sharp but most goodnatured Despite the lack of drama there was immediate evidence of how important this nomination was Several Senators referred to the Supreme Courts 4to4 deadlock today on an Illinois abortion case as a reminder that the Courts balance on a number of key issues was at stake in the nomination

Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Deadlocked on State Laws Restricting Minors' Access to Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/15/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-deadlocked-state-laws-restricting-minors-access.html,Underscoring the importance of Judge Anthony M Kennedys nomination the Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 today on the constitutionality of state laws restricting minors access to abortions The Courts onesentence decision ends efforts by the State of Illinois to reinstate a 1983 law that sought to restrict minors abortion rights for the purpose of promoting consultation with their parents The tie vote which set no national precedent suggests that if Judge Kennedy is confirmed his vote could decide the constitutionality of laws restricting access to abortion for minors and perhaps for adults The nominee began testifying today as the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing The court has not acted on a number of ideologically charged cases being considered for review including a challenge to a Government drug testing program apparently because it is waiting for confirmation of a new justice Added Burden Cited The Illinois law would generally have required girls under the age of 18 who wanted an abortion to wait 24 hours after both parents had been formally notified or to go to state court and persuade a judge to bypass the requirement for notification and the waiting period A Federal district court struck down the law before it took effect on the ground that it was too much of a burden on minors seeking abortions because it could cause longer delays and increase the costs and medical risks of the procedure A Federal appeals court came to the same conclusion for somewhat different reasons in a 2to1 decision The Supreme Courts decision Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 had the effect of postponing a definitive ruling until some future case in which Judge Kennedy if confirmed could presumably cast the decisive vote Similar Laws in 23 States In the past Judge Kennedy has expressed cautious skepticism about whether the Constitution protects sexual privacy and other rights not actually spelled out in the text But he has not commented specifically on the Courts precedents protecting abortion rights generally or on minors abortion rights in particular At least 23 states have passed laws requiring either parental notification or parental consent before minors can obtain abortions Previous Supreme Court decisions leave it unclear which of these laws are constitutional As is usual when the Court has a tie vote in a case it issued no opinion and did not disclose how the membersvoted The Court simply released an unsigned order stating in its entirety The judgment below is affirmed by an equally divided Court Speculation by legal experts as to how individual Justices voted was complicated by the possibility that some may have wanted to throw out the states appeal on technical grounds Opponents of the Illinois law had argued that the appeals court decision was not sufficiently final to warrant Supreme Court review and they wanted the Court to avoid ruling on the merits of the abortion law itself Division on Court In previous abortion cases and statements Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Justice Byron R White have called for overruling the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion and Justices Sandra Day OConnor and Antonin Scalia have made it clear that they would at least narrow judicial protection of abortion rights Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall Harry A Blackmun and John Paul Stevens have generally supported broad abortion rights Asserting that todays action showed the Courts current eight members to be evenly split on abortion issues Janet Benshoof an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer said today that Judge Kennedy would apparently hold the balance of power and that this caused her concern Noting the nominees prior expressions of skepticism about whether the Constitution protects sexual privacy Ms Benshoof said that if he is confirmed I have very serious doubts about the viability of abortion rights and in particular minors abortion rights In six previous decisions involving limits on minors abortion rights the Court has struck down laws that give parents an absolute veto over their daughters decisions It has held that a prompt and expeditious judicial bypass procedure must be available both for mature minors and for those immature minors who can show that their best interests would be served by having abortions without parental consent But the Court has also upheld some state requirements that minors submit to such court procedures if they want to have abortions without telling their parents reasoning that immature minors could benefit from such governmental encouragement to consult their parents A number of challenges to state laws restricting minors abortion rights are pending in lower Federal courts and are likely to reach the Supreme Court They include a case now before a Federal appellate court in which a Federal district judge struck down a 1981 Minnesota law somewhat similar to the Illinois law In other actions today the Court did thefollowing Black Lung Rule Upheld The Court made it somewhat harder for thousands of coal miners and former miners to prove their eligibility for black lung benefits In a complex technical decision the Court upheld by 6 to 2 the Labor Departments position that under its regulations a single item of evidence supporting a claimants position such as a positive chest xray is not always enough to prove he is entitled to an interim presumption of eligibility for benefits Justice Stevens wrote the opinion holding that claimants must establish their eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence and thus overcome any conflicting evidence in order to win such an interim presumptionMullins Coal Co v Director Office of Workers Compensation programs No 86327 Jurisdiction on Review Of Unfair Labor Practice In a labor case the Court ruled that Federal courts have no jurisdiction to review certain informal settlement agreements dismissing unfair labor practice complaints that have been approved by the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board NLRB v United Food and Commercial Workers No 86594 The Court declined to hear an appeal by a Kentucky high school teacher who was dismissed for showing her class an Rrated movie which included some nudity and sexually explicit scenes about a troubled rock star The students some of whom had requested the film entitled Pink Floyd  The Wall ranged in age from 14 to 17 A Federal district judge had ruled that the dismissal in 1984 for insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher violated the teachers free speech rights The judge had awarded her reinstatement and 10000 in damages But a Federal appeals court reversed his decision by 2 to 1 Fowler v Board of Education No 87657

The Questions Begin: 'Who Is Anthony Kennedy?',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/15/us/the-questions-begin-who-is-anthony-kennedy.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings yesterday on the nomination of Judge Anthony M Kennedy to the Supreme Court Following are excerpts SENATOR JOSEPH R BIDEN Jr Democrat of Delaware committee chairman    Our role of advice and consent demands from every Senator a thorough and careful review even with nominees of sterling character and qualifications as you obviously have Judge Kennedy We have spent the past month reviewing all 438 of your opinions that you wrote and close to 1000 opinions that you were part of if not the author and the 20 speeches delivered by you These hearings will extend that review and should provide a rich body of information that will answer the questions who is Anthony Kennedy and what does he stand for and how does he view the Constitution and its role in our society SENATOR ORRIN G HATCH Republican of Utah    I think we as a committee have to refrain from delving into your personal views with regard to constitutional doctrine    Dont be bullied or badgered into thinking youve got to answer every question that we ask up here Some of them you simply cant answer and some of them you simply have to say this is a matter that is presently in the courts and this law may come before the Supreme Court and I have to be concerned about whether or not I prejudice my right to sit on that particular case in the future SENATOR BIDEN Judge Kennedy in your 1986 speech on unenumerated rights    you place great emphasis on the specific text of the Constitution as a guidepost for the Court     that the Constitutional text must be our principal reference     As I read your speech you were concerned that unenumerated rights articulated by the Supreme Court such as the right of privacy but not exclusively limited to that in your words have a readily discernible basis in the Constitution    The point I want to raise with you is there seems to be an underlying tension here that you talk about liberty as being a spacious phrase and you insist at the same time that Constitutional text must be our principal reference     Id like you to give us your view of the liberty clause Do you believe that the textual reference to liberty in the 5th and 14th Amendments and in the Preamble to the Constitution provide the basis for certain fundamental unenumerated rights JUDGE KENNEDY Senator of course the very tension the great debate the great duality in Constitutional law and this has been true since the Court first undertook to interpret the Constitution 200 years ago has been between what the text says and what the dictates of the particular case seem to require from the standpoint of justice and from the standpoint of our Constitutional tradition and the point of my remarks  and we can talk about the Canadian speech in detail if you choose  was that this is really the great role of a judge In order to try to discover those standards that implement the intention of the framers And the framers were very careful about the words they used They were excellent draftsmen They had drawn 11 Constitutions for the separate states And this they recognized was a unique undertaking But the words of the Constitution must be the beginning of our inquiry and how far can we continue that inquiry away from the words of the text The question is whether or not there are unenumerated rights To begin with most of the inquiries that the Supreme Court has conducted in cases of this type have centered around the word liberty And the framers used that what I call spacious phrase both in the Fifth Amendment almost contemporaneous with the Constitution and again in the 14th Amendment they reiterated it The framers had an idea which is central to Western thought Its central to our American tradition Its central to the idea of the rule of law And that is that there is a zone of liberty a zone of protection a line thats drawn where the individual can tell the Government beyond this line you may not go Now the great question in Constitutional law is one where is that line drawn And two what are the principles that you refer to in drawing that line Q But there is a line A There is a line Its wavering Its amorphous Its uncertain But this is the judicial function Q Id like to settle if we can at the outset here the question of whether or not any commitments were given or asked for In your questionnaire you identified at least seven different sets of meetings and a number of phone calls that you had with White House staff or Justice Department personnel before you were actually nominated by the President Let me ask you this first since completing your questionnaire have you recalled any other meetings or conversations of any type that have not already been identified and that took place before your actual nomination A No I have not recalled any such additional instances Q    Let me read to you    from a newspaper article by a columnist named Cal Thomas     Im quoting from his article Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina told me that he and Judge Kennedy met in a private room at the White House on Nov 12 Then a quote within a quote  I think you know where I stand on abortion Mr Helms said to Judge Kennedy Judge Kennedy smiled and answered Indeed I do and I admire it I am a practicing Catholic  The article then goes on to say Judge Kennedy did not elaborate but Mr Helms interpreted the response to mean that Judge Kennedy is opposed to abortion and would look favorably on any case in which the Courts earlier decision striking down the abortion laws of all 50 states might be overturned    Could you for the record characterize for us how accurate or inaccurate you think that column is A I have not seen that column but Ive absorbed it from what youve said Senator    The conversation that you referred to was wide ranging of a personal nature in which the Senator asked me about my family and my character and I told him as Ive told others of you that I admire anyone with strong moral beliefs Now it would be highly improper for a judge to allow his or her own personal or religious views to enter into a decision respecting a constitutional matter SENATOR STROM THURMOND Republican of South Carolina Judge Kennedy the Supreme Courts decision in Marbury v Madison is viewed as a basis of the Supreme Courts authority to interpret the Constitution and issue decisions which are binding on both the executive and legislative branches Would you please give the committee your views on this authority A Marbury v Madison is one of the essential structural elements of the Constitution of the United States As we all know the doctrine of judicial review is not explicit in the Constitution I have very little trouble finding that it was intended Federalist No 78 makes that rather clear And I think that this vital role is one of the critical structural elements of the Constitution and that its essential to the maintenance of constitutional rule Q Judge Kennedy 20 years have passed since the Miranda v Arizona decision which defined the parameters of police conduct when interrogating suspects in custody Since this decision the Supreme Court has limited the scope of Miranda violations in some cases Do you feel that efforts and comments of top law officers throughout the country have had any effect on the Courts views and what is your general view concerning the warnings this decision requires A I cannot point to page and verse to show that the comments of law enforcement officials have had a specific influence but it seems to me that they should The Court must recognize that these rules are preventative rules imposed by the Court in order to enforce constitutional guarantees and that they have a pragmatic purpose and that if the rules arent working they should be changed And for this reason the Court should pay close attention to the consequences of what it has wrought And certainly comments of law enforcement officials taken in the proper judicial context it seems to me are relevant in that judgment SENATOR EDWARD M KENNEDY Democrat of Massachusetts    You were a member of the Olympic Club for many years before you became a Federal judge You continued to be a member of the club for 12 years after you became a Federal judge even though it discriminated against blacks and women    You apparently didnt try to change the discriminatory policies of the Olympic Club until the summer and you didnt resign until your name evidently surfaced on the short list of potential nominees My questions a simple one And then why did it take so long A   There was an article in the New Yorker magazine which really triggered off my action Then I wrote a letter to the club which the committe has in which I indicated that its time to make the egalitarian spirit a reality When I heard that the bylaw had been turned down principally the objection was women in the athletic facility not to racial minorities I thought that my position had become quite untenable And I therefore resigned     SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN Democrat of Alabama In Judge Borks hearing I think we questioned him for a long length of time before we finally got around to asking him about Roe v Wade     I think the American people would like for you to give an expression pertaining to that case A In any case Senator the role of the judge is to approach the subject with an open mind to listen to the counsel and to look at the facts of the particular case to see what the injury is to see what the hurt is to see what the claim is and to listen to his or her colleagues and then to research the law
NO BIG CRITIC OF THE COURT; NOMINEE'S ANSWERS CONTRAST WITH BORK'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/us/no-big-critic-of-the-court-nominee-s-answers-contrast-with-bork-s.html,Judge Anthony M Kennedy came across in Senate testimony this week as a man with a subtle mind who had no preconceived answers to the hardest questions he would face on the Supreme Court He said he was generally comfortable with the state of constitutional law and aware of but not particularly upset by its internal contradictions and ambiguities In this regard Judge Kennedy contrasts starkly with Judge Robert H Bork the thundering critic of the modern activist liberal Supreme Court who was President Reagans first nominee for the seat that Judge Kennedy now seems assured of filling Judge Kennedys friendly reception by the Judiciary Committees chairman Senator Joseph R Biden Jr and others who helped defeat Judge Bork is evidence that a majority of the Senate and perhaps of the public like the Court much the way it has been and do not share the Reagan Administrations urge for change Not Everyone Is Pleased But while Democrats like Mr Biden rushed to embrace Judge Kennedy the nominee did not please everyone least of all the more passionate partisans in both ideological camps liberal and conservative And his ambiguous answers to questions raising the most controversial issues left unclear what Judge Kennedy would actually do on key issues like abortion affirmative action and religion As some supporters of Judge Bork have repeatedly stressed at this weeks hearings Judge Kennedys testimony on some issues such as the need for judges to respect the roles of elected officials in making social policy sometimes echoed that of Judge Bork whose views were more nuanced and cogently reasoned than many of his critics acknowledged No Reagan Imprint But the differences between the ideas of the two jurists were more striking than their similarities and other Bork supporters expressed dismay at Judge Kennedys testimony Bruce Fein a former Administration official concluded regretfully in an interview that Judge Kennedy will not leave a Ronald Reagan imprint on the Supreme Court Judge Bork had for many years condemned as illegitimate usurpations of legislative power dozens of Supreme Court decisions expanding individual rights over the last 65 years They included the entire line of rulings in which the Court has recognized rights to marital privacy and abortion and some of those in which it has expanded free speech protections struck down forms of racial and sex discrimination upheld limited affirmative action and required strict separation of church and state Judge Bork was widely seen as a man committed to moving the Court in a more conservative direction and curbing individual rights He sought to mute this impression in his testimony backing away from some controversial prior statements But he could not dispel it Whereas Judge Bork had worked out a comprehensive judicial philosophy premised on the original intent of the framers of the Constitution Judge Kennedy said I do not have an overarching theory a unitary theory of interpretation I am searching as I think many judges are for the correct balance in constitutional interpretation So many of the things we are discussing here are for me in the nature of exploration and not in the enunciation of some fixed or immutable ideas Flexible Concept of Intent In expounding a more flexible concept of the Constitutions original intent than had Judge Bork Judge Kennedy asserted that the spacious language of some constitutional provisions could justify decisions inconsistent with the subjective expectations of those who drafted and adopted them An example of this was Judge Kennedys testimony that the Constitutions language barring governmental deprivations of liberty without due process of law is quite expansive quite sufficient to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional heritage including an evolving right to marital privacy Judge Bork had long said that the same language protected only procedural rights and provided no general protection of privacy or other substantive rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution Judge Kennedy strongly hinted without quite stating that he agreed with the Courts 1965 decision striking down a Connecticut law that barred use of contraceptives even by married couples He suggested that the law infringed upon the core values of privacy that the Constitution protects Judge Bork had long denounced that decision as judicial usurpation of power saying the Connecticut law was nutty but constitutional Judge Kennedy declined invitations from a conservative senator who wanted him to list some modern Supreme Court decisions as examples of abuse of power and stated that I dont think the judiciary of the United States as a whole has departed from its mandate or its authority Judge Bork has over the years assailed more than two dozen major Supreme Court precedents and expressed broad disapproval of modern legal trends

Compromise Clears the Way For Reagan Abortion Curbs,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/18/us/compromise-clears-the-way-for-reagan-abortion-curbs.html,Congressional negotiators have decided to allow the Reagan Administration to proceed with tough new abortion restrictions on family planning groups handing a victory to the White House and its antiabortion allies The action came Wednesday when House and Senate negotiators working to resolve differences in their versions of a multiagency appropriation bill agreed to strike an amendment that would have blocked the regulations at least until next October Gary Bauer a chief policy adviser to President Reagan said he had told the negotiators the amendment was subject to a veto and could threaten the operation of the entire Government since it would have become part of a bill providing money for all Federal agencies until next Sept 30 Mr Reagan set the stage for the conflict when he proposed new regulations aimed at putting up a barrier between contraceptive and abortion services offered by groups that receive family planning money from the Department of Health and Human Services Mr Bauer said today that he and the budget director James C Miller 3d would have recommended the veto and he predicted Mr Reagan would have taken their advice Given his strong views on abortion I do not think hes in the mood to allow Congress to ram these things down his throat he said An Important Victory Doug Johnson legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee said Its an important victory Theres no doubt now that the Administration will be free to issue the new rules which will eliminate abortions from the family planning program The groups are not allowed to use the Federal money for abortionrelated services But they do advise pregnant women that abortion is an alternative and they sometimes share physical facilities records and staff with groups that perform promote or lobby for abortions All of this would be barred under the new rules Lucy Eddinger a spokeswoman for the family planning program said the Department of Health and Human Services would not have the regulations ready before Christmas Opponents of the regulations say they will result in inferior medical care for poor women who make up the bulk of patients served by federally financed family planning clinics They also say the physical separation requirements are not feasible for hospitals and other multipurpose facilities Pennsylvania Abortion Bill Vetoed HARRISBURG Pa Dec 17 AP Gov Robert P Casey today vetoed legislation to restrict abortions in Pennsylvania saying a provision requiring minors to notify their parents or the courts first was unconstitutional Mr Casey who said he opposed abortion on every moral ground said the requirement poses the almost certain and unacceptable prospect of invalidation by the courts and costly unsuccessful and avoidable litigation
Judge Kennedy's Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/opinion/judge-kennedy-s-constitution.html,As the repeated Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominees have demonstrated the Constitution lives Last week it was studied argued over and even shaped by the Senate Judiciary Committees dialogue with Judge Anthony Kennedy If confirmed he will have much to say about what the Constitution means Even in his testimony last week he contributed generously often brilliantly to the continuing dialogue The result was an absorbing reallife course in constitutional law in which the nominee and the senators learned from each other Now with the hearings over the exchange will continue in writing until the committee votes in late January Some questions persist especially as to Judge Kennedys understanding of ethnic and gender discrimination Otherwise he looks like a justice all Americans whatever their politics can respect Judge Kennedy did not merely respond to the senators questions but gave creative constitutional insights He began by admitting or affirming that he has no overarching unitary theory a contrast to the defeated nominee Robert Bork that gratified all but the senators of the extreme right Is there a right of privacy beyond the literal Bill of Rights Yes he said There is a zone of liberty a zone of protection a line thats drawn where the individual can tell the Government Beyond this line you may not go  That liberty is quite expansive quite sufficient to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional heritage And yes contrary to Judge Bork that includes some right of marital privacy This is no commitment to vote a certain way on specific matters like abortion But it shows a mind willing to search for that principled line  which is all the Senate and the public can honorably ask Judge Kennedy offered an eloquent definition of original intent and how to reconcile it with modern social views If the draftsmen of the 14th Amendment were willing to live with segregated societies where is the basis for instance for Brown v Board of Education the 1954 school desegregation decision Here is Judge Kennedys view The whole lesson of our constitutional experience has been that a people can rise above its own injustice that a people can rise above the inequities that prevail at a particular time The framers of the Constitution originally in 1789 knew that they did not live in a constitutionally perfect society but they promulgated the Constitution anyway They were willing to be bound by its consequences And in my view the 14th Amendment was intended to eliminate discrimination in public facilities on the day that it was passed Those who search for broad constitutional purpose today are not hobbled by the past but bolstered by experience New generations yield new insights and new perspectives The idea that the framers of the Constitution made a covenant with the future is what our people respect Judge Kennedy heard senators probe other aspects of his fitness Though restless about belonging to exclusive private clubs he was slow to quit them Though more attentive than some judges to strong MexicanAmerican claims he has also often thrown them out of court Passionate and reasoned complaints by Hispanic lawyers deserve further response He might in answer be unaccountably clumsy and insensitive the next four weeks might bring other surprises But so far the more the public learns about Anthony Kennedy the more appealing his nomination appears
"While Examining Kennedy, Senators Look Back at Bork",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/weekinreview/while-examining-kennedy-senators-look-back-at-bork.html,MEMBERS of the Senate Judiciary Committee had two goals one stated and one unstated when they convened last Monday for the hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Anthony M Kennedy The overt goal at least for the Democratic majority was to make sure Judge Kennedy matched his reputation as a nondoctrinaire conservative It did not take the members long to decide that he did and they wished him well and sent him on his way after only a day and a half of polite questions and wellreceived answers The other part of the agenda surfaced on the third and last day Only then free of the need to appear decorous in the nominees presence did senators clash openly over the events of the past few months revealing how determined they had been all along to use this hearing to shape the public perception of why the first nominee for the vacancy Judge Robert H Bork was defeated Inevitably the two goals were intertwined Judge Borks shadow was a looming presence last week his testimony a frequent if unspoken reference point for the questions that senators put to Judge Kennedy Beyond the committee the Senate as a whole was vitally interested in taking the measure of this nominee Many senators particularly the conservative Southern Democrats and the six moderate Republicans who voted against Judge Bork had declared themselves willing and even eager to support a true conservative for the Supreme Court if only President Reagan would send them one They have no appetite for another bloody battle and looked to the Judiciary Committee for confirmation that none would be necessary Even before the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd of West Virginia dropped in to offer Judge Kennedy his best wishes for long service on the Court it was clear that there would be no repetition of the Bork fight In February after the yearend recess the committee will probably recommend Judge Kennedys confirmation unanimously barring startling new information With Republican bitterness over Judge Borks defeat still raw no bipartisan consensus was possible within the committee on the hidden agenda the shaping of the perception of what had led up to this moment Yet in the long run the outcome of the battle for the legacy as one Democratic Senate aide labeled this effort could determine how the Senate approaches not only this Supreme Court vacancy but those that are certain to occur within the next few years The Lynch Mob View Was Judge Bork simply the victim of a lynch mob as President Reagan and others have charged Personal confrontation makes most politicians uneasy and if the lynch mob interpretation takes root senators could well shrink from doing battle against a future Supreme Court nominee even one they disagree with profoundly The balance of power in Supreme Court nominations would tilt sharply toward the White House Or as several committee Democrats insisted last week did the Bork nomination fail because after serious and appropriate consideration both the Senate and the country rejected Judge Borks judicial philosophy The result of that interpretation would be to validate the role the Senate assumed during the Bork fight that of an equal partner with the President entitled to scrutinize the nominees views and to insist that these include a generous reading of the role of both the Constitution and the Court in protecting individual liberties As both sides recognized answering the question of who Anthony Kennedy is would help answer the question of what happened to Robert Bork To make the case that it was judicial philosophy that defeated Judge Bork the Democrats needed to establish unmistakable differences between his views and those of Judge Kennedy The effort was more successful than the Democrats had reason to hope for particularly given the consensus that Judge Kennedy was under no obligation to give his views on specific questions especially those like abortion affirmative action and churchstate issues on which the Court is evenly divided Judge Kennedys testimony gave little guidance on how he would vote But his generalities were nonetheless reassuring even eloquent He accepted the view that the Constitution protects the right to privacy and other rights not spelled out in the text a concept Judge Bork rejected And he gently but unmistakably disavowed the notion that constitutional interpretation can be confined to a mechanical search for the original intent of the Framers He spoke of a Constitution with a builtin capacity for growth of Framers who made a covenant with the future While Judge Bork appeared preoccupied with what the Constitution should not be asked to do Judge Kennedy spoke of its potential The presence of Laurence H Tribe the liberal Harvard law professor underscored the difference as perhaps nothing else could have He was the Judiciary Committees star academic witness against Judge Bork He testified in support of Judge Kennedy calling the nominee capable of genuine judicial greatness Not everyone agreed Joseph L Rauh Jr the godfather of civil rights law and veteran of many great Senate battles accused the committee of playing pattycake with Judge Kennedy whose confirmation he said would be a kind of Russian roulette with the Bill of Rights It was telling that as Mr Rauh sat at the witness table growling at the senators his spiritual children the leaders of numerous civil rights organizations that had worked feverishly against Judge Bork sat silently in the back of the hearing room They had decided that the wisest course of action was to declare victory in the battle for the legacy go home and hope for the best
IDEAS & TRENDS; Tailoring Catholic Theology In a Time of Modern Plague,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/weekinreview/ideas-trends-tailoring-catholic-theology-in-a-time-of-modern-plague.html,DURING the plagues of the Middle Ages the Roman Catholic Church relaxed its prohibition against cremation so that bodies could be burned to stop the cycle of disease and death In the plaguelike epidemic of the 1980s  the rapid and devastating spread of AIDS  is it appropriate for the church to relax however slightly its longstanding opposition to the use of condoms Catholic bishops theologians and members of the laity have been debating this issue in the 10 days since the administrative board of the United States Catholic Conference released a policy paper on acquired immune deficiency syndrome In The Many Faces of AIDS a Gospel Response the board which has the authority to speak for the nations bishops took a compassionate look at the disease that has already killed 22000 Americans The paper which warned repeatedly against stereotyping homosexuals as carriers of the disease began with three stories of people with AIDS a heterosexual woman a homosexual man and an infant who will never live to know the meaning of the illness from which she is dying They provide us with an opportunity to walk with those who are suffering the bishops wrote to be compassionate toward those whom we might otherwise fear to bring strength and courage both to those who face the prospect of dying as well as to their loved ones About halfway through the 30page paper came the line that has provoked the controversy In a discussion of educational policy in a pluralistic society where not everyone heeds the Catholic call for sexual abstinence the paper said that it might in some instances be appropriate to teach that condoms can help prevent AIDS We are not promoting the use of prophylactics the bishops added but merely providing information that is part of the factual picture Such a factual presentation should indicate that abstinence outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage as well as the avoidance of intravenous drug abuse are the only morally correct and medically sure ways to prevent the spread of AIDS Even with these caveats the document has been widely interpreted by both supporters and opponents as giving Catholic educational programs a license to mention condoms  if the discussion is framed in a way that emphatically states that using them is wrong A footnote to the paper quoting Thomas Aquinass Summa Theologiae in Latin gave the bishops rationale In translation the section read    those who govern rightly tolerate certain evils lest certain goods be impeded or also lest some greater evil obtain Gradations of Evil This argument startled John Cardinal OConnor the Archbishop of New York I am shocked to hear this presented as the lesser of evils because that can be applied to many things the Cardinal said last Sunday after celebrating Mass at St Patricks Cathedral Later in the week a theologian close to the Cardinal explained his thinking If the lesseroftwoevils argument could be made for condoms said Msgr William B Smith academic dean and professor of moral theology at St Josephs Seminary in Yonkers NY why not abortion Why not euthanasia Why not sterilization No analogy can be drawn between cremation and contraception he said The ban on cremation which was lifted around the time of the Second Vatican Council in the mid1960s was made to discourage antiCatholics who engaged in the practice as a means of challenging the churchs belief in bodily resurrection He said dispensations to the rule were routinely given if no denial of faith was involved However Eugene Kennedy a professor at Loyola University in Chicago insisted that the analogy is apt He noted that the policy paper of the bishops was not advocating anything outside of church doctrine but recognizing that without education regarding condoms some people would unnecessarily die Mr Kennedy who frequently writes about the American bishops said that he shared the enthusiasm for the document expressed by such prelates as Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle But he said he was not surprised by the ardent opposition of Cardinal OConnor who was joined in his criticism by Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston Archbishop Edmund Szoka of Detroit and other prelates Here we have a man who is a strict constructionist Mr Kennedy said He is not a man who has any affection for ambiguity and he is saying firmly I am not going to allow a pattern of relativistic thinking  He noted that the Cardinal spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain He is both an Admiral and a Cardinal he said His fear is that    a tiny leak at the bottom of the ship might lead to the whole ship going down Monsignor Smith predicted that the action of the administrative board would be undone when the 300 bishops meet as a full body next year but Mr Kennedy said he believed that the document would stand It clearly reflects the consensus of the bishops he said This is their public meditation in a time of plague

China Display Of the Shoddy Breaks Down,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/world/china-display-of-the-shoddy-breaks-down.html,Consumers in China a land where refrigerator doors fall off the frames of bicycles crack as they are wheeled from the store and the hands of doughnutsized watches ignore conventional notions of time are up in arms Or so the countrys newspapers say In a rare concerted attack on a Government ministry newspapers have denounced a decision to cancel the countrys first exhibition of the shoddiest consumer goods It is a farce and deception wrote Wu Jincai a reporter for the official New China News Agency The Economic Daily lashed out at the ministrys decision as a humiliating disgrace for Chinas consumers In August confronted with a nationwide growl of unhappy consumers the Ministry of Light Industry declared that it would display the countrys worst products  batteries that leak washing machines that masticate clothes and color televisions that arent in color WhistleBlower Hunted But in a covert collaboration between manufacturers and the ministry the exhibition was canceled and then an investigation was begun to find the ministry worker who exposed how the decision was made according to a barrage of articles in the nations papers that provided a glimpse into decisionmaking here Chinas ambitious effort to reorder its economic system along more Western lines has borne fruit in the form of a range of consumer goods inconceivable only a decade ago But this new cornucopia has come packed with a great many products that break or do not work As industries churned out more radios tape recorders and washing machines concern for quality gave way to demands for volume according to many of Chinas newspapers As a result the Ministry of Light Industry which oversees the production of a vast array of home appliances bicycles and personal items decided to exhibit the worst of the consumer goods in an attempt to shame manufacturers into producing better products But a few days ago the ministry announced that the exhibition of shoddy goods has triumphantly finished its task The assertion was greeted with astonishment in the normally compliant press The organizers of the exhibition have obviously succumbed to pressure against exposing the inferior quality of some products which had intensified as the opening date drew near wrote Mr Wu of the New China News Agency 4400 Complaints Received The Guangming Daily said that after the ministry announced its intention to stage the exhibition it received more than 4400 letters from across China from people complaining about products and urging that they be included in the show In the months that followed the ministry assembled filled a warehouse with poor quality products But according to The Guangming Daily the contents of the warehouse were closely guarded and the consumers letters themselves were deemed secret But someone in the househould appliances bureau under the ministry alerted a television station which filmed the products and showed them on TV the Englishlanguage China Daily wrote A department of the ministry even tried to ferret out the informer Mr Wu reported Zeng Xialin the Minister of Light Industry admitted that some people at his ministry were resentful of the exhibition Mr Wu wrote He quoted the minister as saying To protect their favorite factories they deleted letters of complaints about their products from the computer Worse Mr Wu maintained factories brought pressure to bear upon the ministry For example some factory managers threatened to stop supplying Beijing with their goods he said The abortion of this wellintended event was just what some people expected from the beginning Looking for Silver Lining A reporter from Liberation Daily tried to find the silver lining of what was being widely portrayed as a national embarrassment More than 800 repairmen from over 70 factories came to Beijing to repair or replace their lowquality products the reporter Si Maxin wrote We can say that from this the aborted exhibition still contains a glimmer of success But the next day Mr Wu pursued his theme by bemoaning the plight of Chinas consumers Why cant consumers stand up for their rights he asked on the front page of The Economic Daily In theory one billion consumers occupy a position of dominance but every letter of complaint is invariably the voice of only one individual These voices never seem to be able to come together to become loud enough to command attention Now he concluded everything depends on the consumer Chinas consumers must be modern consumers They must have a new image they must have the freedom to be choosy and the right to choose
CONNECTICUT OPINION: A CHRISTMAS SAMPLER; TOYS: THE MESSAGE DEPENDS ON THE STYLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/nyregion/connecticut-opinion-a-christmas-sampler-toys-the-message-depends-on-the-style.html,TWICE last Christmas Eve my conscience was prodded by people who make it their business to do such things Both times I agreed with the message but was silent in my assent Their method was just not for me Early in the afternoon I was walking down Main Street in pursuit of a final gift the holiday spirit cheerily in me Across the street Tony was conducting his daily vigil in opposition to aid to the contras Paunchy bearded jovial Tony was dressed as Santa Claus I waved and called Merry Christmas and Tony waved back and called the same I thought he had a bell in his hand but he still held his fliers I had often passed Tony on that side of the street I never accepted one of the fliers but I did see the posters which held images of war blooded bodies haunted children and villages nothing but a pile of rubble Slogans decrying United States aid to the contras hung from an easel Later I sat in my car and wondered about my steadfast resistance in avoiding conversation with Tony Essentially though the issue is obviously closer to his heart than mine I agree My mind wandered to the billboard on Route 195 now displaying a downhill skier but which had protested abortion That billboard had simply said This child never had a choice and displayed the bloodied and mangled form of a purported aborted fetus To that billboard display I always said no to both message and method but the method objection was the stronger of the two The billboard used rank sensationalism and highly charged and emotional propaganda Far from convincing me to oppose abortion it lowered my estimation of the antiabortion cause I got out of my car and headed for the supermarket finally understanding my thoughts that afternoon Such displays as Tonys and the billboards are for sensibilities so committed as to not see the effectiveness of a softer stick After gathering ingredients for a Christmas Eve dinner that included at least one of everyones favorite things I stood in the checkout line behind a young woman her Christmas Eve dinner was a container of salad from the salad bar with a white sheet pinned to her winter coat In bold black letters it said Boycott War Toys and displayed a picture of a gun bent in half with its wooden barrel shattered I asked her about her sign I said it as a joke and she smiled before answering She had been out in the cold she said which was why it was pinned to her coat She and some other protesters had been kicked out of a mall The toy stores did not want wartoy protesters hurting their business she explained but she had seen other groups setting up displays inside the mall I suggested that those other groups recreation departments bowling alleys colleges  had applied for permission before setting up Had her group She said she did not know but was convinced that permission would have been denied anyway She had decided to keep her message pinned to her back she said even though she was not actively protesting at the time because it got people to ask questions as I was doing I did not tell her I agreed with her cause I did not ask her why toys should be boycotted and I wondered later if she was disappointed I believe that war toys do encourage or sanction violence by trivializing death and killing or by encouraging ethnic stereotypes and illconcealed vigilantism Her message was noble I thought but how many parents caught up in the giftbuying frenzy and Christmas rush would pause and consider it with Rambo dolls and guns still to buy and wrap After all arent such toys what the children want And how many people would take time to talk with a person with a sheet on her back My message would be the same I thought but I would deliver it differently I recalled a ponderous but small truth One person cannot save the world but one person can save a small piece of it I had lots of toys for my nephews and nieces none of them warlike but I would not start a small war in my mothers living room by proclaiming to my sisters that I had boycotted war toys I would deliver my message a little differently On Christmas Day the gifts I bore  foldup opera glasses flashinglight yoyos crayons books peelaway drawing boards largefanged dinosaurs telescopes  shared the floor with the toy guns and knives I told one of my sisters that I did not like war toys but I did not directly tell her she should not have got one for my son Later I quietly explained the theory behind my rejection of war toys I think she understood though I am not sure that in the end she agreed But I thought it was a start I then noticed what the children after a day in a sea of toys were still playing with One of my nephews an infant too young to know what he was lugging still clung to his gun When the trigger was pulled it made noise and flashed a light I could appreciate the sight and sound no matter what they were housed in Another nephew was still playing mesmerized with the weird yoyo A niece was throwing soft cloth blocks at a wall she does not need an instrument of war to be violent Two other nephews were playing a card game I hoped the young woman in the supermarket had had someone to share gifts with and that the gifts she gave conveyed her message as effectively as she could hope
"POLITICS; Gephardt on Issues: Different Tacks, Not Going With the Tide",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/22/us/politics-gephardt-on-issues-different-tacks-not-going-with-the-tide.html,This country is about change says Representative Richard A Gephardt a Democratic Presidential candidate Id rather change and be right than be rigid and be wrong This is how the Missouri Congressman responds to accusations that he has shifted his political position on significant issues to accommodate his national campaign On most fundamental issues he maintains he has not shifted at all Occasionally he says he has moved to a different tactical approach without abandoning longrange goals Sometimes when circumstances changed he has moved to meet them With the first 1988 delegate selection just over the horizon Gephardt critics are stepping up their charges that he has been at best inconsistent and at worst unprincipled Opponents in both parties say he has reversed himself on abortion tuition tax credits education and the 1981 tax cut among other issues and has thus cast doubt on his future adherence to his current positions At the forefront of this criticism are the antiabortion forces Through his first four House terms Mr Gephardt supported a constitutional amendment to bar abortion except to save the life of the mother He withdrew that support before seeking reelection to the House in 1986 saying the amendment could not be passed and calling for alternative approaches such as sex education and family planning to reduce unwanted pregnancy Assurances and Suspicion The Congressman maintains that he is still personally opposed to abortion but that assurance does not remotely satisfy such organizations as the National Right to Life Committee In a fourpage tabloid devoted to Mr Gephardt and abortion the committee states The extent and speed of his shift on abortion if fully understood may raise questions in the minds of journalists party activists and voters regarding Gephardts overall commitment to principle Asked to respond to this Mr Gephardt said The principle involved here is helping people avoid abortion which is an unfavorable outcome Thats always been my belief and remains so today The question is how to serve that belief I understand the anger and disappointment of those who disagree with me on this issue but what I am advocating now is what I believe will best advance that goal The most recent newsletter of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life carries an unflattering picture of Representative Gephardt and calls him Tricky Dick The newsletter says he dumped his decadelong antiabortion stand to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination but is reported fading fast in Iowa Caucuses in that state on Feb 8 will provide the first concrete evidence of Presidential preference in both parties A Nautical Metaphor Although Mr Gephardt voted against almost all Federal expenditures for abortion in the House through 1984 he promised earlier this year that if elected President he would not veto bills including such appropriations This stand has caused further anguish among antiabortion groups The abortion question is listed with several others in an article in the Dec 14 issue of The New Republic which explores several changes of issue position by Representative Gephardt since his early days in Congress The writer John J Pitney Jr concludes All politicians of both parties at least successful ones trim their sails to adjust to prevailing winds Few have shifted as dramatically quickly and smoothly as Richard Gephardt At the recent candidates debate staged by NBC News Senator Albert Gore Jr of Tennessee one of Mr Gephardts rivals challenged him on the Missourians 1981 vote for the Reagan Administration tax cut bill He suggested that current Gephardt criticism of the Administrations economic policies represented another shift in his political position Gephardt aides maintain that Democrats and Republicans agreed in 1981 that a tax cut was necessary and that the Congressmans support of the Reagan bill after the Democratic alternative had been narrowly defeated did not contitute an endorsment of Reaganomics then or now Aide Sees Consistency Mark Johnson of the Gephardt campaign staff said it would have been irresponsible for the Congressman to vote against the final tax cut bill after having supported a Democratic version of the same move On the most important issue in this race the future of the national economy Gephardt is the one candidate with a consistent record of leadership Mr Johnson said The Missouri Congressman once favored establishing tuition tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools a proposal that has been criticized as government support of parochial education Mr Gephardt says he withdrew his backing when he became committed to tax simplification I decided the tax code should not be cluttered with credits and deductions he says Votes in Carter Era Recalled One of Mr Gephardts major campaign pledges is a substantial increase in the quality of American education but opponents note that during the Carter Administration he voted against creating the Department of Education The candidate says his belief that the job could be done satisfactorily in the then existing Department of Health Education and Welfare reflected the position of the American Federation of Teachers at the time Since then however he has opposed President Reagans occasional proposals to abolish the new department He asserts that Mr Reagans attempts have been intended to minimize any Federal role in education a philosophy Mr Gephardt opposes Representative Gephardt concludes that a candidate should be consistent in supporting beliefs or goals on a particular issue but its also important to be willing to change some particular stands in order to achieve these goals When facts and circumstances change its important that you be willing to change Being rigid is improper

Mother Russia Makes a Comeback on Births,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/26/world/mother-russia-makes-a-comeback-on-births.html,It was almost noon feeding time when the chief doctor Yevgeny A Volpin burst into a dormitory at Moscow Maternity House 27 Our beautiful young mothers he announced beaming at the five women hastily tucking bared breasts into their hospital gowns How many does this make for you Two And you my lovely Also two Good for you Just like the statistics The bemused mothers at this north Moscow maternity ward are part of a reversal with potentially important political and economic consequences women from the Russian majority in the Soviet Union are having more babies Despite cramped and often overcrowded apartments dire shortages of such basics as baby clothes the high divorce rate for Russians and the fact that most women work fulltime jobs and bear the brunt of food lines and household chores the statistics show that Russian women increasingly are having two or three children rather than one or two Demographers here and in the West say the trend is a victory for a strong policy that offers mothers financial incentives to have children extended leave improved maternity care and a dose of probaby propaganda The policies have been remarkably successful said Murray Feshbach of Georgetown University a specialist in Soviet population and health You have to ask how long it will last if they dont solve the housing problem and get better medical care but they have the beginning of a major improvement Western population experts long ago calculated that without a higher birth rate the Soviet Union would have trouble finding enough workers for its factories and new conscripts for its army Moreover while the birth rate among Russians and other European ethnic groups has languished the Asian minorities in Soviet Central Asia have been prolific This has already led to dislocations in the economy that result when people are born in one place and factories are located in another The high birth rates of ethnic minorities also causes concern about language and cultural gaps especially in the military and about the potential allure of Islamic fundamentalism Beginning with a 1981 decree the Government has gradually increased the inducements for larger families Olga Marozova interviewed while she waited for an ultrasound examination at the maternity clinic here is expecting her second child in January She will remain away from her job as an office worker until the baby is a year old with a monthly stipend of 35 rubles about a fifth of her normal wage Mrs Marozova was paid a bonus of 50 rubles about 80 for her first child and will get 100 rubles for the second The average wage is about 200 rubles a month The benefits are hardly lavish but Mrs Marozova said that together with the Soviet system of free medical care and the prospect of a new apartment in five years or so it was enough to convince her and her husband that they could afford a bigger family Since the first measures to encourage births were introduced in the early 1980s the birth rate has turned upward and begun to increase at a slightly faster rate according to official data Last year 199 babies were born for every 1000 people in the Soviet Union up from 17 a decade ago The comparable United States figure is 155 but more American babies survive because of superior medical care The rate of population increase is rising in 11 of 15 Soviet republics including Russia according to the most recent official data Replacement Rate Lags The birth trends are not enough to satisfy demographers Mikhail S Bedny a prominent Soviet specialist in medical demographics said the national average of 194 births a couple still falls short of what demographers call the replacement rate needed to assure a stable population about 25 births a family In addition the rising Russian birth rate is still far outstripped by the rates in Soviet Central Asia Soviet experts concede that by the year 2000 Russians now 515 percent of the population will become a 49 percent minority in the nation commonly called Russia But the upturn in the Russian birth rate has strengthened the conviction of Soviet policy makers that they are on the right course A new round of inducements is to be introduced in the new year including an additional six months of partly paid maternity leave and legislation creating parttime jobs for mothers Mr Bedny said other factors behind the increase include a slight decline in the use of abortion Abortion is still the most common form of birth control here with 10 operations not uncommon for a Russian woman Soviet demographers say they continue to be alarmed at the high rate of infant mortality despite a steady improvement Statistics for 1986 show that 254 Soviet babies die for every 1000 live births compared with 104 in the United States The neat brick building where Dr Volpin presides over 20 births a day is a superior installation for the Soviet Union featuring American incubators Japanese ultrasound machines and other imported technology A Devotion to Superstition But doctors readily concede that in a rural setting or less prestigious city the facilities would not be so impressive The newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya reported last month that it is still common for clinics in many areas to lack blood pressure gauges for infants or feeding tubes for newborns who have trouble eating The newspaper said some parts of the country have infant death rates comparable to those in Paraguay or Thailand One thing Dr Volpins clinic has in common with the most remote villages is a devotion to tradition bordering on superstition Because of a passionate fear of germs for example husbands are not allowed to visit their wives and newborn children for the first four or five days after birth The idea of a husbands being present for a birth provoked embarrassed mirth among the new mothers And newborns are still swaddled like papooses from head to toe in the belief that this makes babies secure warm and well behaved Dr Volpin said he believes wrapping babies slows muscle development but it is clinic policy to swaddle because mothers insist on it
Consumers Take Aim At Florio,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/nyregion/consumers-take-aim-at-florio.html,ON THE wall opposite Representative James J Florios desk is a plaque given to him in 1985 by the Consumer Federation of America for outstanding service to consumers Lately however Mr Florio has been drawing fire from the federation and other consumer activists here for his part in a measure that they say will make it harder for a victim of a faulty or dangerous product to take the manufacturer to court Joan Claybrook president of Public Citizen the organization founded by Ralph Nader called the bill a consumer nightmare The federation has denounced it as an invitation to industry to cut research and qualitycontrol budgets Mr Florio Democrat of Pine Hill said the measure had been somewhat of a nightmare for him too As chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection of the House Energy and Commerce Committee he wields broad power on consumer issues and is looked to by many as a champion of consumer rights Representative Henry A Waxman a Democratic committee member from California said Mr Florios support of the bill surprised him Ordinarily I would think Mr Florio and I would be together on almost all consumer issues Mr Waxman said but hes finding himself a different group of allies on this and so will I Mr Florio said he had been working to balance the bill which he predicted would pass regardless of his position Working with its propoAn Opinion article on the Consumer Product Safety Commission is on Page 16 nents he said was the only way to reach a compromise that took consumer concerns into account I think I managed to eliminate some of the worst parts he said The measure drafted by Representative Bill Richardson Democrat of New Mexico seeks to replace the 50 state consumerliability laws with one uniform standard It would be used by judges to instruct juries in product liability cases in which victims sometimes receive cashdamage awards that some corporations and insurance companies feel are disproportionately large Although few people are opposed to a uniform standard the provisions of Mr Richardsons proposal brought a torrent of protest from consumer groups and their advocates on Capitol Hill They see the legislation as an industry push to avoid liability for unsafe or defective products For instance the bill would exempt manufacturers from liability for injuries caused by products that met the safety standards of the day but later proved dangerous Under that provision for example the Ford Motor Company could not have been sued for injuries related to its Pinto model which was found to explode if struck from behind at speeds as low as 20 miles an hour Similarly the CibaGeigy Corporation of Toms River which produced an antiarthritis drug known as phenylbutazone which later was found to cause dangerous and sometimes fatal reactions in some patients could not have been sued for damages because the Food and Drug Administration had approved its use A compromise offered by Mr Florio eliminated a clause that would have granted immunity to companies that produced asbestos in the past The companies are facing suits from people who developed cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos This is a cruel bill that makes it more difficult for injured persons to have their day in court against corporations Mr Nader said at a news conference attacking the legislation Mr Florio said that his role of peacemaker between opponents and supporters was uncomfortable and that the change had been an indication of what had happened to the House Energy and Commerce Committee The committee which has principal jurisdiction over consumer laws was once dominated by a solid coalition of consumer advocates he said but now is more disposed toward the concerns of manufacturers Frankly there are fewer and fewer proconsumer members on the panel Mr Florio said Theyve all gone elsewhere and the consumer rights environmental and civil rights forces [ on the panel ] have got smaller and smaller In the early 1980s the committee was packed with members considered proconsumer said Mr Waxman who is considered a consumer activist Weve lost some tremendously talented and committed members over the last several years A result of the shift in the committee said Pamela Gilbert of the US Public Interest Group a proconsumer organization founded by Mr Nader is a bigger say for what she views as the proindustry forces led by the committees chairman Representative John D Dingell Democrat of Michigan He represents the district where Ford has its headquarters The industry group she said includes Representative Norman Lent of New York the committees ranking Republican and two other Republicans Edward Madigan of Illinois and Don Ritter of Pennsylvania All are ardent supporters of the Richardson bill Mr Lent said that the measure simply balanced current inequities which he asserted had led to irresponsible suits and inflated damage awards that had hurt American business This will correct the problems that businesses and insurance companies are having in gauging risks for new products he said There is a real problem there because of the undependibility of what our tort system will yield The current system leads to inconsistent verdicts Mr Lent Mr Dingell and others argue that multimilliondollar punitive damage awards such as the 62 million awarded to victims of the Dalkon Shield interuterine contraceptive device manufactured by the A H Robins Company have led other concerns to pull safe products off the market The Robins device resulted in spontaneous septic abortions Following the damage award G D Searle and other companies halted plans to produce other IUDs that showed no signs of problems Only last month was the first new IUD introduced to the American market Judy Shuler speaking for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said that the drug industry wanted to see a limit on punitive damages The courts have expanded potential liability of manufacturers to the point where insurance companies and manufacturers dont know where the lines are drawn she said The net result is not good for consumers but leads to higher prices Alexander Trowbridge president of the National Association of Manufacturers said that the Richardson bill had been weakened by Mr Florios compromises but still saw it as a way to lessen the high legal costs of American businesses But an injured multinational corporation is not the same thing as an injured consumer said Mr Waxman who sees no value whatsoever in the proposed measure He said he had been surprised to find Mr Florio on the other side of the fence Mr Florio and Mr Waxman have been allies on another consumer issue this year a publicrelations battle to force the resignation of Terrence Scanlon chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission a Federal agency Both Congressmen say Mr Scanlons tenure at the agency has been a low point for consumer protection Recently Mr Florios subcommittee approved a separate bill aimed at forcing the commission to become more aggressive in pursuit of manufacturers that violated safety regulations The irony of this thing is that we are fighting to give a little backbone to an agency we hope to see protect consumers and he [ Mr Florio ] is working to take away their rights to sue in court Mr Waxman said

emissaries from a sinister Death Planet And if sex wars are escalating which side is winning Predictably there is little agreement Men say women are triumphing Women claim the opposite As in real wars body counts are unreliable Speaking for the female side Susan Forward the author with Joan Torres of Men Who Hate Women  the Women Who Love Them reports that when she went on a television talk show to describe abusive husbands who suffer from what she sees as the prevalent psychological disorder of misogyny the network reported one of the most overwhelming phonecall responses that theyd ever had Even more dramatically Andrea Dworkin claims in her most recent book of feminist theory Intercourse that most men who make love to women make war on women because intercourse remains a means or the means of physiologically making a woman inferior communicating to her cell by cell her own inferior status    shoving it into her over and over    until she gives up and gives in  which is called surrender in the male lexicon Similarly the speaker of Ms Dworkins latest novel Fire and Ice declares that coitus is punishment and adds ominously I am a feminist not the fun kind AS for men who feel about women the way Ms Dworkin feels about men they are numerous judging by the enthusiasm with which masculine audiences have received Robert Blys proselytizing According to a 1986 article in The San Francisco Chronicle this poet thinks the mens movement is going through a sea change these days The sensitiveguy model is being replaced by the Wild Man in search of the primitive roots of his maleness At rallies that feature 30 conga drummers hammering out a tribal beat and men capering about in fearsome masks Mr Bly sermonizes to hundreds of enthralled listeners that there is something about being a man over the last 20 years that is connected with the feeling of inadequacy notes grimly in the same article that that 20year period coincides with the rise of feminism and adds glumly that right now the force field of the mother is very strong In our culture he says it is usually the woman who is willing to be fierce and not the man The man now has to learn how to be fierce The plot of sexual battle is of course as old as literature itself But it was not really until the mid19th century when female resistance became feminist rebellion that the battle of the sexes emerged as a symbol of struggle over political as well as personal power Since then it seems that whenever sexual politics seize the public imagination writers have turned to the plot of battling sexes It should come as no surprise then that the subject has resurfaced lately Literary sex wars have escalated in the past decades specifically because of the cultural revolution set in motion by the womens movement in the late 1960s Parallels to whats happening now existed in the 19th century and again in the early 1920s Inspired by the first campaigns for womens rights male artists from Tennyson to Gilbert and Sullivan from Hawthorne to James produced works with plots that punished feminist characters and showed signs of male anxiety Tennysons long narrative poem The Princess 184751  a tale of sexual battle fueled by its heroines protofeminist establishment of a womens college  was so compelling that a quarter of a century later Gilbert and Sullivan parodically portrayed the same heroine in Princess Ida making her the ruler of a lunatic feministseparatist university who proclaimed woman    shall conquer man Both works dramatized the utter defeat of their uppity heroines But the sex antagonism these texts explored reached a significant climax when the very phrase became the title of a book by a British academic named Walter Heape who declared in 1913 at the height of the suffrage struggle that the present womans movement has its origin in such antagonism noting that it has led to strife as brutal as bitter and as unrestrained as that shown in any class war between men alone Soon such major modernists as D H Lawrence and T S Eliot were leaping into the fray or at least standing on the sidelines and cheering Fight for your life men urged Lawrence in a 1923 polemic whose masculinist theory could be said to permeate many of his novels Fight your wife out of her own selfconscious preoccupation with herself Batter her out of it till shes stunned Any man might do a girl in confided the protagonist of Eliots Sweeney Agonistes 192627 a fragmentary verse drama that hints at dark connections between sex and sacrifice Any man has to needs to wants to  Once in a lifetime do a girl in But if modernist men studied sex antagonism with intense seriousness some of their descendants were more amused than threatened by the antics of the armies on both sides perhaps because the feminine mystique that gained ground at midcentury made it easier to scoff at feminist rebellion As early as 1945 James Thurbers hilarious cartoon sequence The War Between Men and Women portrayed male and female adversaries fighting in the grocery taking each other hostage and struggling at a climactic Gettysburg In 40s films like Adams Rib and The Maltese Falcon too gender strife turned out to be good box office Like a number of more recent film makers however many male novelists are depicting an escalation in the battle of the sexes that is no laughing matter for even some of the wittiest works on the subject picture a world on the verge of total war Specifically in the years that saw the founding of the National Organization for Women 1966 the publication of Kate Milletts Sexual Politics 1970 and the appearance of Ms magazine 1972 men of letters not surprisingly became preoccupied with feminists who were not the fun kind and wild men in search of the primitive roots of their maleness Norman Mailer examined the brutal bloody war between the sexes in The Prisoner of Sex 1971 a defensive retort to Ms Milletts criticisms of him and Henry Miller in Sexual Politics Going on the offensive Amiri Baraka LeRoi Jones entered the combat zone with Babylon Revisited 1969 a cursepoem directed at a 20thcentury femme fatale May this bitch and her sisters all of them receive my words in all their orifices like lye mixed with cocola and alaga syrup   More parodically Thomas Berger in Regiment of Women 1973 imagined a world where men who seem to have been vanquished by bullying women are encased in uncomfortable dresses and incarcerated in sperm banks where they are milked by female top sergeants Perhaps most melodramatically John Irvings popular The World According to Garp 1978 offered scenes in which Garps wife bites off her lovers penis in an auto accident that kills one of her sons and partially blinds the other Garps famous mother is shot by a reactionary man and Garp himself is mowed down by a deranged womensliberation fanatic who has had her own tongue surgically removed Though Mr Irvings portrayal of feminists as selfmutilating hysterics is savage his novels denouement implies that as the battle of the sexes grows increasingly violent a triumph for either side is a Pyrrhic victory Certainly three of the most recent novels about mens reactions to feminist threats  George Stades Confessions of a LadyKiller 1979 Leonard Michaelss Mens Club 1981 and Ishmael Reeds Reckless Eyeballing 1986  focus on male protagonists who become absurd in the very act of winning their struggle with women Mr Stades ladykiller does manage to do in three feminists associated with the mischievous journal Ms Chief But he starts out as a 135pound weakling and ends up having to listen to speeches with such titles as Beyond Man From Society to Sorority Mr Michaelss men do succeed in creating a consciousnessraising session of their own at which they reduce their hosts house to a shambles But we are told that they founded their club only because they envy women for having a political movement And Mr Reeds black masculinist rebel does find a baroque way to terrorize a series of feminist cultural commissars but is forced to promulgate their position that black men ought to be lynched if they recklessly eyeball  that is look at  white women IN other words no matter how hard these male characters try to learn as Robert Bly recommends to be fierce they seem to feel theyve failed seem indeed to feel that feminists somehow have more fun But do their female contemporaries agree When we look at writings by women from Charlotte Bronte to Margaret Atwood it doesnt appear that they do While many men of letters react with rage to what they perceive as unprecedented female power literary women analyze female powerlessness at least as often as they exult in newfound strength For as is frequently the case in the history of sex relations some men view the smallest female steps toward autonomy as threatening strides that will strip them of authority while many women respond to such masculine fears with a paradoxical sense of guilt and vulnerability Even if we turn to womens utopian or quasiutopian works we dont find all that much optimism nor do we generally find the same kind of bellicosity Where male descriptions of sexual conflict often present women as daunting opponents womens works often depict feminine vulnerability and masculine violence In fact until quite recently women writers have rarely been able to envision clearcut female victories in the sex war and even more to the point most have been unable to imagine that a female character in her right mind would try to win a battle with a man in any but the most devious ways Tennysons contemporary Charlotte Bronte for instance did portray a wrestling match between man and wife  but Bertha Mason Rochester in Jane Eyre 1847 the woman foolish enough to show virile force in the contest is a captive madwoman who hasnt a chance Just as trapped by circumstance the black speaker of Elizabeth Barrett Brownings Runaway Slave at Pilgrims Point 1850 can only revenge herself against her rapistowner by murdering her illegitimate child whose white face has the masters look By the turn of the century as the suffrage movement gained momentum women writers were consciously analyzing such dilemmas paying special attention to the male sexual brutality that they blamed for their heroines troubles Most of the victories these women imagined came about through lucky strikes and happened in the world of fantasy Most notably perhaps the American activist Charlotte Perkins Gilman created in Herland 1915 an allfemale community whose strongminded parthenogenetic women were serendipitously freed from patriarchal oppression when all their men died off With the modern period women writers either became more explicitly militant or began to create more openly combative female characters Men ought to be horsewhipped broods the feminist protagonist of Dorothy Richardsons Honeycomb 1917 while Virginia Woolf brilliantly outlines the ideology of the sexual battle in A Room of Ones Own 1929 This great modernist draws a portrait of a representative misogynist Professor von X who sits in the British Museum writing his monumental work entitled The Mental Moral and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex and jabbing his pen on the paper as if he were killing some noxious insect In retaliation the feminist narrator herself flushed with anger begins drawing cartwheels and circles over the angry professors face until it becomes an apparition without human semblance or significance Such obliterations of the enemy became increasingly difficult to imagine however in those decades when the pervasive feminine mystique let men poke fun at angry women and left feminist rebels feeling like freaks By 1951 for instance Carson McCullerss Ballad of the Sad Cafe depicted a woman who was a kind of monster precisely because she was a great fighter and who was therefore defeated in a wrestling match with her estranged husband Even visions of victory in this period were vexed and hexed One of Sylvia Plaths most famous poems does imagine annihilating Daddy But when this poet notoriously declares So Daddy Im finally through her conclusion suggests that even if she is done with the patriarch she herself may also be finished off Problematic as Plaths visions of victory may have been though coming when they did in the early 60s they were quickly fetishized by a generation of women suddenly swept up in the hope that as Kate Millett put it a second wave of sexual revolution might at last accomplish its aim of freeing half the race from its immemorial subordination From the moderates who began working for passage of the ERA in the early 70s to the radicals who signed the manifesto produced by SCUM Society for Cutting Up Men which proclaimed that the male is an incomplete female a walking abortion participants in the revitalized womens movement enlisted with new fervor in the battle of the sexes Particularly in the genres of science fiction fantasy and poetry a number of writers produced antiutopias that are the very opposite of Gilmans Herland visions of worlds in which men have got so deeply in touch with what Mr Bly considers the primitive roots of [their] maleness that they enslave and even exterminate women The misogyny at the heart of such brutality is analyzed by a battered wife in Nancy Prices recent novel Sleeping With the Enemy 1987 when she explains about the psychology of men who hate women If you sleep with them youre called one set of obscene names if you wont youre still cursed but with another set of names But Marilyn French had already anticipated both this analysis and Ms Dworkins definition of intercourse when she presented the idea that all men are rapists and thats all they are They rape us with their eyes their laws and their    Strong as these accusations are Margaret Atwoods Handmaids Tale 1986 is probably the bestknown antiutopian feminist work to appear in recent years Denied all freedoms healthy women of childbearing age in Ms Atwoods horrifying Republic of Gilead are forced to submit to ritual attempts at impregnation meant to transform them into babymaking machines Ironically this societys fundamentalist ideology proclaims the need to save women from sexual violence but the grotesquely impersonal mating to which the handmaid is subjected  an experience for which no proper word can be found Copulating    would be inaccurate    nor does rape cover it  reveals that the cure is at least as bad as the disease Less well known than The Handmaids Tale but just as apocalyptic in their vision of the sex war are several fascinating science fiction works by women James Tiptree Jrs Screwfly Solution 1977 and Suzette Haden Elgins Native Tongue 1984 along with its sequel The Judas Rose 1987 In the first a mysterious epidemic of murders or massacres of women associated with the rise of a misogynistic cult called the Sons of Adam ends in the extermination of all the women in the world Similarly Ms Elgins books record female tribulations in a world where the 19th Amendment has been repealed and women have no public rights at all Ms Elgins heroines do however have one set of weapons not available to Ms Atwoods and Ms Tiptrees vanquished women  words of their own In Native Tongue and The Judas Rose a group of female linguists has created a secret language called Laadan In this respect at least they are allied with the more powerful women warriors imagined by a range of other feminist writers Most notable here are two characters in Joanna Russs Female Man 1975 In Ms Russs fantasy the resourceful Janet represents the serenity of the allfemale planet Whileaway and her biblically named counterpart the murderous Jael symbolizes the rage that fuels interminable sex wars between Manlanders and Womanlanders in a sexually conflicted futurist world The vengefulness of Ms Russs Jael is of course deliberately depicted as extreme at one point she exults in the gory killing of a Manlander called Boss and confides that the best way to silence an enemy is to bite out his larynx Equally extreme is Adrienne Richs feminist version of Amiri Barakas masculinist Babylon Revisited a poem in which white acetylene  ripples from the speaker as she attacks a male antagonist raking his body down to the thread of existence burning away his lie leaving him in a new world a changed man   Even women writers who are not so frankly polemical as Ms Atwood Ms Russ and Ms Rich have produced riveting accounts of the war between men and women For instance from the resonant confrontation of a nubile teenage girl with a deadly gentleman caller in her now classic short story Where Are You Going Where Have You Been 1970 to the bloody sex crimes that constitute The Mysteries of Winterthurn 1984 and the sexual assault that horrifies the protagonist of Solstice 1985 Joyce Carol Oates has powerfully delineated the subtle nuances as well as the broad contours of violence between the sexes As for Ms French and Ms Dworkin for the heroine of Solstice heterosexuality results in a disfiguring scar sensitive to the touch as an open wound repulsive to look upon In the meantime a number of Ms Oatess contemporaries have commented ruefully on what they see as the inevitability of sexual battle Other wars end eventually in victory defeat or exhaustion complains a character in Alison Luries War Between the Tates 1974 but the war between men and women goes on forever She and her husband are antagonists confesses the heroine of Diane Johnsons novel The Shadow Knows 1975 musing that our interests were opposed maybe the interests of men and women fundamentally are Still one wonders when peaceful coexistence between the sexes  a coexistence not predicated on a separatist peace  might become possible Surely by now some of the old wounds of the feminist struggle have healed A key poem in Ruth Stones new collection SecondHand Coat begins as an elaborate curse of an old lover but ends with a conciliatory incantation addressed to the Poor innocent lecher may you be exonerated May you be forgiven  May you be a wax taper in paradise What are the circumstances that foster such impulses toward the cessation of hostilities Ms Stones poem suggests that they have to do with historical nightmares in this case World War II that virtually annihilate gender distinctions and the latest work by one of our most important contemporary women novelists supports the point Toni Morrisons tender and elegiac Beloved dramatizes the ways in which black men and women enslaved by history resisted bondage to whites by bonding with each other even when they had lost the family ties incarnated in the dead baby Beloved and in the rest of the dearly beloved dead Brilliantly examining just the premise of infanticide on which Elizabeth Barrett Browning had drawn in the 19th century Ms Morrisons book ultimately honors a woman who preaches Dont study war no more Lay all that mess down Sword and shield and concludes with its hero describing the love of a dead man for a woman who is a friend of my mind Is it only under great duress and after horrifying losses that men and women can win through to a detente where they become friends of each others minds Given the commitment of feminists to what Kate Millett almost two decades ago defined as a hope of freeing half the race from its immemorial subordination must male and female antagonists continue substituting stalemated violence for love and friendship Can the sexes lay down sword and shield sometime soon or will the year 2001 witness a war of the words between feminists who are not the fun kind and wild men in search of the primitive root of their maleness
"Body and Mind;
CHILDBEARING AND AGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/magazine/body-and-mind-childbearing-and-age.html,LEAD I REALIZED NOT LONG ago that a dozen or so of the women I know most of them in their late 30s  old friends peers colleagues  were spending more time than theyd like in infertility clinics I found that this fact somehow added to my aches and pains that it imposed on me a kind of gnawing unease adding to my heightened sense of age as I pass 40 I REALIZED NOT LONG ago that a dozen or so of the women I know most of them in their late 30s  old friends peers colleagues  were spending more time than theyd like in infertility clinics I found that this fact somehow added to my aches and pains that it imposed on me a kind of gnawing unease adding to my heightened sense of age as I pass 40 The longing to create new life can be deep and abiding and even to witness that desire denied is painful Perhaps my generation is feeling the pain more acutely than some we thought we could do anything All those marches and love beads the greening the optimistic songs And our liberated women would keep on marching beside the men  into medicine law politics business up to the laboratory bench and onto the playing fields Children The folder was stamped Postponed What caught up with us was something far more profound than the simple truth that the human body ages that it becomes more difficult as one gets older to undertake all variety of physical feats from running marathons to bearing babies What was at work here is anthropologically significant a form of preprogrammed aging if you will programming unique to humans Only in humans among our near relatives does the end of female reproductive life precede the tidal wave of aging by many years Evolutionary theory has it that the amount of energy put into begetting offspring is directly related to mortality that is life cycles seem genetically disposed to last about as long as it takes to reproduce Thus once monkeys and apes can no longer produce babies in the wild they soon die Not so for humans Women come to an end of their reproductive capacity and they and their spouses live on for another 20 30 or 40 years But consider the world in which we evolved  say the world of 50000 years ago Life expectancy at birth was around 30 years with the average skewed by high mortality in infancy If you look now at life expectancy after childhood in huntergatherer tribes that still exist much as they did in the Stone Age the Kung San or Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa for instance  old age as we understand it is far from a sure thing According to studies done by the anthropologists Nancy Howell and Richard Lee the average life expectancy if youve made it to 15 is 55 But interestingly the average age at which a Kung woman has her last child is about 39 The numbers may tell an evolutionary story one that explains that humans are not so different from other animals after all Its just that the human mother needs to stay around to care for her offspring and humans have an extraordinarily long childhood There needs to be enough energy to enable an animal to complete its reproductive cycle  to perpetuate itself The last child born say when the mother was 39 needs care to grow to an age at which its own reproduction could begin at 16 or so to insure continuity of the lineage The mother could then die at 55 with a certain as it were evolutionary peace of mind Such theories help explain why the human reproductive clock may have been designed to run out about when it does They dont explain how the clockwork slows down But new technology and research are beginning to provide that explanation A human female doesnt generate eggs after birth My 9monthold daughter has all she will ever have  more in fact because they are steadily lost from birth onward fewer than half remain when fertile cycling begins In the last century or two improvements in nutrition and health in general are probably responsible for increasing the reproductive span to nearly 40 years Still when you look through a laparoscope  a thin fiberoptic tube for spying on internal organs through a small hole in the skin  at an ovary that has been through hundreds of cycles even in a superbly healthy American female you see a scarred battered organ Every fertile cycle ordinarily entails the release of one egg from its surface a part of that surface has had to swell with a spot of bloody fluid then burst open to disgorge the egg An analysis published last year in Science by Jane Menken and James Trussell of Princeton and Ulla Larsen of Lunds University in Sweden is among those that have confirmed declines in fertility with age Childlessness rose from around 5 percent in a group whose members married between ages 20 to 24 to around 9 percent in the 25to29 age group For those marrying in the early 30s it was over 15 percent in the late 30s more than 25 percent For marriages beginning between 40 and 44 it was over 60 percent The scarring of the ovary though dramatic is only one mechanism of reproductive aging Much of the process is hormonal Fertile cycling is maintained by hormones produced by the ovary these depend on pituitary hormones which in turn require a releasing hormone from the hypothalamus in the brain Both the onset of reproductive capacity at puberty and its later phasing out are genetically timed by interaction of these hormones Then too there is the steady decline in the number of eggs  but not just from being released once a month which would use up only 500 or so over an average reproductive span of the 400000 estimated to be present at puberty Finally those eggs that do survive until about the age of 35 have a greater likelihood of having an extra chromosome in the nucleus a disastrous piece of luck that can result in a disorder such as Downs Syndrome Evolution seems to have produced a system that screens out most such abnormalities however by discharging the defective embryo New research also implicates the womb itself The uterus it turns out loses its hospitality The environment it creates for implantation and for the maintenance of pregnancy begins to be less suitable It too depends on hormones that help prepare the uterine lining and enable the embryo to function As the hormones decline the uterus ages loses half its weight from age 30 to age 50 and begins to dry out Collagen and elastin  two crucial proteins that make it durable and flexible as they do skin and connective tissue throughout the body  decline markedly HE NEW ART and science of making testtube babies respects the aging uterus Because what is being introduced is an alreadyfertilized egg the issues of egg production and union with sperm are moot by the time of implantation The question is Will it take R G Edwards of Cambridge University who shepherded the first testtube baby in 1978 says All of our available evidence indicates that the uterus and not the ovary or the embryos themselves is the cause of the declining incidence of pregnancy in women over 40 Patrick Steptoe another invitro fertilization pioneer has made a similar point on spontaneous abortion after age 40 And Zena Stein of the New York State Psychiatric Institute published an analysis in The American Journal of Epidemiology showing that miscarriage rises sharply after age 35 not only because of an increase in fetal abnormalities with age but also because of rejection by the uterus of an even larger number of normal fetuses At the same time the administration of an experimental birthcontrol drug called RU486 prevents implantation by acting against the hormone progesterone It also has the effect of terminating a pregnancy in which implantation has recently occurred It is one of the ironies of modern medicine that we study with equal eagerness the means to prevent or terminate pregnancy and the means to promote or maintain it Analysis of the receptivity of the uterus is crucial to both Thus science undoubtedly will turn on itself in trying to solve infertility by experimenting to overcome the effects of RU486 Controversy continues about how to advise women Certainly there is little risk in waiting until the early 30s to have a baby In the late 30s the risk of involuntary childlessness becomes substantial and in the early 40s great Yet motherhood is possible for many women even until age 50 On Oct 1 Pat Anthony 48 years old of Johannesburg gave birth to her own grandchildren  triplets conceived invitro by her daughter and soninlaw thus proving the power of at least one 48yearold womb as a surrogate for another half its age And despite the generally unfavorable odds there have been many successful invitro attempts for individual women in their late 30s and early 40s Life holds risks and the intelligent young woman can theoretically try to assess the loss she would feel if she ended up infertile add in the likelihood of childlessness if she waits to a given age and weigh the sum against the personal advantages of waiting Of course real life is not that simple Careers have a logic of their own And because most women are not willing to try this alone the right man must come along There is the possibility of adoption though this itself is not emotionally painless It can result in as much parental satisfaction as comes to biological parents How to guess the future The medical frontier is continuously moving forward Artificial insemination invitro surrogacy  who knows whats next Surely one can count on some future chemical magic that will enhance implantation and maintain pregnancy Yet neither that hope nor the consolation of evolutionary understanding can erase the discomfort that arises from an arbitrarily waning force of life
U.S. Testing of Students Raises Growing Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/us/us-testing-of-students-raises-growing-debate.html,Increased Federal testing of what American schoolchildren have learned is the subject of a debate in Congress and among educators and the outcome will affect American education for decades Tests are symbolic of your goals for schooling said Larry Cuban associate dean of education at Stanford University What is on the test becomes more important than what is not on it Earlier this month as part of a catchall 74 billion education bill the Senate voted to expand the current Federal testing program to make it possible for the first time to rank states and even large school districts on the basis of student scores The legislation would also allow the Secretary of Education to develop a test of academic excellence that 11th graders could take on a voluntary basis Those who passed would receive a certificate of commendation from the Department of Education Legislation passed by the House of Representatives did not deal with either testing program a conference committee is to meet next year to work out differences between the two bills Proponents of more systematic Federal testing assert that the United States virtually the worlds only industrialized country lacking national academic standards can no longer afford to leave quality control to states and local school districts Emphasis on Upgrading Schools The old view of states and local districts doing their own thing is obsolete said Ramsay W Selden who heads the testing arm of the Council of Chief State School Officers which represents the nations state school superintendents Those who favor more Federal testing say it will spur school systems to improve their teaching accelerating the emphasis on upgrading schools that began in the early 1980s I can imagine the governors of Texas and Oklahoma comparing notes about whose kids do best academically rather than about how their football teams do said Denis Doyle senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute a social research center Threat to Diversity Seen Others argue that since no formal sanctions would be attached the new tests are unlikely to have much influence on local schools But opponents charge that expanded national exams especially if the statebystate results are reported by the news media will undermine the American tradition that education is a state and local enterprise Whoever controls those powerful tests will control to a large measure what is taught and learned in American schools said George F Madeus director of the Center for the Study of Testing Evaluation and Educational Policy at Boston College Diversity of Curriculums Opponents also maintain that what goes into the tests not only the academic subjects examined but particular topics within those subjects will influence curriculums across the country and undermine the diversity that has always been a strength of the American education system If you have national standardized tests you will end up with a national standardized curriculum said Bernard R Gifford dean of education at the University of California at Berkeley and director of the National Commission on Testing and Public Policy which was established with Ford Foundation support to study testing If teachers in Mississippi Montana and Massachusetts are all going to be held accountable to a national assessment then I assure you they will teach to that test Some educators have expressed dismay that the trend toward more systematic national testing has largely been propelled by political leaders looking for evidence that increased spending for education is producing better educational results Despite objections raised by educational experts they say there has been relatively little public discussion of what these results should be Some critics maintain that the debate over national tests has become a substitute for thinking through what Americans want in their school curriculums Given the decentralized nature of American education and the difficulty of getting a diverse population to agree on matters as controversial as school curriculums they say testing has become in effect a surrogate for a debate over curriculums Testing is a way to shortcircuit the discussion of what we want our schools to teach said Ernest L Boyer president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and author of several influential reports on American schools We can agree more on our tests than on our goals Measure Would Expand National Assessment The pending legislation would substantially expand the National Assessment of Educational Progress an 18yearold project that has recently begun billing itself as the nations report card The National Assessment created in 1969 to monitor the achievement of American schoolchildren administers tests to a scientific sample of 120000 students Assessments of reading writing and mathematical skills are conducted every two years and skills in other subjects including science and civics are assessed on an occasional basis The tests which focus on students who are 9 13 and 17 years old measure what students know and can do in basic academic subjects By reflecting typical school curriculums they differ from standardized college admissions tests which measure more general verbal and math skills The new plan would increase the sample to as many as 700000 students expand the number of subjects to include history and geography and increase the frequency of tests Reading and math skills would be tested every two years writing and science every four and history civics and geography every six years Perhaps most important the legislation would allow the assessment program which now reports national and regional trends to begin publishing statebystate results Such comparisons were barred by Congress because of fears that results would embarrass lowachieving states Under the pending legislation states would have the option of putting up money for the National Assessment to increase the number of their students in the sample Since many state boards of education are under enormous pressure from governors and other state leaders to demonstrate educational improvements many states are expected to sign up for this option Optional Test Revives A 20YearOld Plan The other national examination endorsed by the Senate the Optional Test of Academic Excellence revives a plan that Senator Claiborne Pell a Rhode Island Democrat first introduced 20 years ago with Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky The legislation authorizes the Secretary of Education to spend 2 million to develop a test of acquired skills and knowledge appropriate to completion of a secondary school education that high school juniors could take if they chose to Those who passed would receive a certificate from the Secretary The Secretary would have the option of designing a new test or using one designating an existing commmercial test such as the Iowa Tests of Educational Development or the California Achievement Tests Because the House of Representatives has not studied the pros and cons of more systematic national testing prospects that expanded testing will be included in the final version of the education measure are still unclear Representatives Augustus F Hawkins a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor and Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania the ranking Republican on the committees Subcommittee on Elementary and Secondary Education recently sent a letter to two dozen education groups soliciting their views A Dramatic Change In Political Attitudes The legislation is a reflection of a dramatic change in political attitudes toward education in the 1980s after a series of scathing reports on the quality of American schools Reacting to the criticism states began enacting measures that ranged from more rigorous course requirements for a high school diploma to merit pay for teachers The reports fostered a conviction that while education is a state responsibility and a local enterprise the nation as a whole has a big stake in how schools perform Having poured millions of dollars into school reform governors and other state political leaders also began looking for evidence that their investments were paying off A big and very significant change has come over American education said a report issued earlier this year by a study panel appointed by Education Secretary William J Bennett and headed by former Gov Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and H Thomas James president emeritus of the Spencer Foundation Today rather than wanting to conceal suppress or avoid knowledge of how the educational progress of children in one state compares with that in another we now accept such comparisons as legitimate and desireable Virtually all of the debate about Federal testing has focused on control of the expanded National Assessment of Educational Progress Under the current system the agency that holds the contract to design and administer the test must covene a committee of teachers administrators and other experts on the subject being tested That committee then assumes responsibility for the content of the test Secretary and a Panel To Share Test Control Drafters of the new legislation were eager to take control of the test away from the contractor which now is the Educational Testing Service in Lawrence Township NJ The legislation would give final authority to a panel called the National Assessment Governing Board whose members would be appointed by the Secretary of Education from a list drawn up by the board The idea was to establish checks and balances so that neither the board nor the Secretary can tilt it in some direction said an aide to Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee By contrast the Secretary of Education would be given total control over the proposed Optional Test of Academic Excellence This feature has drawn fire from educators including some who support the National Assessment expansion Its a wolf in voluntary sheeps clothing said Richard Kruse a lobbyist for the National Association of Secondary School Principals Any test written by the Secretary of Education could turn out to be an instrument to bludgeon school officials not a way of recognizing students Even some people in the Department of Education who are enthusiastic about the expansion of the National Assessment have serious reservations about the 11thgrade test Its no more appropriate for the Federal Government to get into such a test than it is for it to say what year a certain course ought to be taught an aide to Secretary Bennett asserted We hope its not in the final bill said the aide who declined to be identified by name But an aide to Senator Pell scoffed at such objections We assume that the Secretary of Education will be a responsible public official he said Albert Shanker president of the American Federation of Teachers also said he had no problem with the Education Secretarys deciding which test to use If the test turns out to be silly it will be subject to public ridicule and lose value he said Debate Over Influence On Local Schools Critics say that no matter what control systems are put in place an expanded system of national testing will become a troublesome political issue because it would create what Michael Kirst a professor of education at Stanford described as a whole new group of educational decisionmakers at the Federal level whose ideas will influence teaching at the local level Mr Gifford the director of the National Commission on Testing and Public Policy said test designers could be expected to become the focus of political logrolling in a way that state textbook adoption committees already are Groups concerned about abortion or more teaching about Mexico or Haiti will lobby to get their ideas included he said But proponents of expanded national testing say the tests will have little effect on local schools I cant imagine Shaker Heights in Cleveland doing the same thing as Tallahassee Fla said Archie LaPointe director of the National Assessment All well be telling schools is here are examples of what your kids do or dont know and problems they can or cant solve They might say Thats scandalous Or they might say Fine the kids will be farmers Its their decision Proponents also reject arguments that it will lead to a national curriculum if only because for all practical purposes a national consensus already exists We have a national economic system that asks for the same skills no matter where youve gone to school said Michael Timpane president of the Teachers College of Columbia University We have a national network of colleges and univesities and a textbook industry that confronts market pressuures to develop large markets These are the big issues not national testing SAMPLE QUESTIONS Following are examples of the kind of mathematical word problems given to 13 and 17yearolds by the National Assessment of Educational Progress as part of

IN THE REGION; KEAN'S STAR RISING IN G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/weekinreview/in-the-region-kean-s-star-rising-in-gop.html,SOME of Governor Keans aides gave their boss a sweatshirt for Christmas with his picture on a map of the United States captioned Tom Keans 8687 North American Tour Like a memento of a rock stars itinerary the back of the shirt lists the 36 cities the New Jersey Republican has visited since his landslide reelection victory in 1985 That win with 60 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the total made Mr Kean an instant celebrity He was offered podiums by some Republicans eager to show that the Reagan revolution was having an impact on the state level and by others who just wanted to know how a Republican candidate could attract so many minority and bluecollar votes These days the 52yearold Governors standing in his party is if anything on the rise Though Mr Kean insists he has no interest in the Vice Presidency the National Republican Chairman Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr among others says Mr Kean is still on his short list Some of the leading Republican Presidential contenders including Vice President Bush Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Jack F Kemp of New York are old friends of Mr Keans They have been calling the Governor frequently to make sure he is keeping an eye on their progress Theyre always nice to me and one called just to wish me a Merry Christmas the Governor said with a smile during an interview last week Hes being wooed by everybody said Representative Jim Courter a New Jersey Republican who supports Mr Kemp Spokesmen for other contenders agreed Anybody would consider Toms endorsement a major prize said John P Sheridan Jr the State Transportation Commissioner during Mr Keans first term and now the state chairman of the Dole campaign If you look around the Northeast and think of prominent Republican figures Toms at the top of the list The Governor has promised to announce an endorsement  or a decision to remain neutral  in February before the Southern states primaries in March From a purely personal viewpoint however a choice will be difficult Ive known George Bush more than 30 years since the time our families were friends when our fathers served together in Congress Mr Kean said I served as campaign manager for the FordDole ticket in New Jersey in 1976 and Ill never forget that Jack Kemp came in and campaigned for me in the 1981 Republican primary for Governor Mr Kean recalled campaigning with Mr Kemp in Camden and spoke of their mutual support of enterprise zones designed to attract jobs to decaying urban centers Mr Kemp the Governor said also has been working a long time to help attract blacks and supporters of labor to the Republican Party The Governor said that in recent weeks the other two candidates have begun hitting themes that he has stressed and that he believes will have broad appeal in the coming election Six weeks ago Mr Bush said that improving education would be a centerpiece of his campaign At about the same time Mr Dole began talking about reaching out to black and workingclass voters After he made a speech on that he called me up and asked did I notice and I said yes I noticed Mr Kean said Mr Kean says he wonders why no one believes his disclaimers about the Vice Presidency and insists that he intends to finish out his remaining two years as Governor But he also has said he would have to consider running on a national ticket if asked Both conservatives and liberals have been attracted by the record of a Governor whose heroes include Abraham Lincoln Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D Eisenhower He has lowered business taxes signed a deathpenalty law persuaded the Legislature to pass a law protecting freshwater wetlands and overseen the divestment of state pension funds from companies doing business in South Africa he supports an equal rights amendment freedom of choice on abortions and gun control His style is lowkey to the point where he has been accused of being unwilling to go to the mat with the Legislature for his programs His difficulties were compounded when New Jerseys Republican Party failed to capture control of the Senate in last months elections making him the states first Governor in more than 20 years to serve two terms without the benefit of a Legislature controlled by his own party at least part of the time He has been unable to get automobile insurance changes he wants to hold down the number of lawsuits resulting from accidents and he lost a battle for a gasoline tax increase in his first term that he said was needed to balance the budget As a result Mr Kean was forced to abandon a campaign pledge and sign increases in both income and sales taxes He relishes using what he calls the bully pulpits available to him As chairman of the Republican Governors Association he took advantage of the organizations annual meeting in Sante Fe N M last month to accuse the Reagan Administration of creating a national tragedy by failing to support housing for low and moderateincome families And although he is unlikely to resume his outofstate speaking schedule soon  he faces another battle with the Legislature over income and sales taxes among other controversies  political experts say he doesnt need further exposure As Gregory C Stevens Mr Keans former Chief of Staff now a political consultant in Alexandria Va put it Hes being talked about inside the Beltway in the capital
Judge Blocks Enforcement Of California Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/us/judge-blocks-enforcement-of-california-abortion-law.html,A judge blocked California from enforcing a new law today requiring women under the age of 18 to get parental consent before obtaining an abortion Judge Morton Colvin granted the injunction sought in Superior Court by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of doctors and others who argued the law violated the pregnant womens right to privacy The injunction blocks enforcement of the law until a trial on its constitutionality The law requires an unmarried woman under 18 who wants an abortion to first get written consent from one parent As an alternative she could seek approval from a judge on the ground that she was mature enough to make the decision on her own or that an abortion was in her best interest It was modeled on laws in 12 other states that have been challenged in court with varying results The Supreme Court has ruled that a properly drawn parentqlconsent law could be constitutional
Washington Talk: The Bill of Rights; Has Religious Freedom Gone Sour?,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/us/washington-talk-the-bill-of-rights-has-religious-freedom-gone-sour.html,Nearly 200 years ago the Founding Fathers drafted a Bill of Rights whose first 16 words insured freedom of worship and separation of church and state to the citizens of the new nation Now a Senator a retired Chief Justice and a British scholar have concluded that that freedom of religion has come on difficult times They see it in the rift over sanctioned school prayer in sparring over municipal Nativity scenes and in other issues The three  Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska retired Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Os Guinness a British scholar who has lived in the United States for three years met last year to talk about organizing a foundation to lead a national rededication to religious liberty Today Mr Guinness is executive director of the foundation they envisioned the Williamsburg Charter Foundation a private organization that plans a series of conferences and forums in 1988 on the role of religion in America Mr Stevens is a trustee of the newly organized group The Comission on the Bicentennial of the United States Consitution which Mr Burger heads gave official recognition to the project What Has Collapsed The members of the Williamsburg foundation do not want to take a stance on school prayer or abortion or the interjection of any religious beliefs into political debate But they think something has gone sour Were not claiming we are in danger of having an American Beirut or Belfast tomorrow Mr Guinness said What has collapsed is a sense of consensus about what place religion should have in public life They have gathered Catholics Jews Buddhists Mormons Christian Scientists academics business leaders members of Congress and other representatives of spiritual and secular life to help draft a charter on the role of religion And they have invited President Reagan to sign it Its members include Senator William L Armstrong a conservative Republican from Colorado Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a liberal Democrat from New York Corretta Scott King widow of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr Rabbi Joshua O Haberman president of the Foundation for Jewish Studies Archbishop John L May president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops J Willard Marriott Jr chairman of the Marriott Corporation and the Rev Billy Graham It is a project to honor the Bill of Rights which was drafted in 1791 but its sole concern is the first 16 words of the First Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof Robert G Kramer a former Maryland state legislator who is the foundations communications director said The religious clauses on the one hand have allowed values to enter American life and be strongly and passionately debated But they have also eased the friction because there is no one established faith and secondly there is no one religious group that can rely on the power of the state So they have to rely on the power of persuasion Talk of Setting Parameters Although they are eloquent in their praise of the ideal of the First Amendment members of the foundation are less clear on what can be done to preserve it They talk about setting parameters and restoring civility when spiritual arguments enter public debates But the most recent draft of their charter a 28page document does not say specifically what the limits should be only that arguments for public policy should be more than private convictions shouted out loud There is a right for individuals and groups to argue their position and to argue it on the basis of their religious beliefs Mr Kramer said Yet arguing carries with it the responsibility not to brand as inhuman others who dont hold the same position Were really pointing out rights with responsibilities The fivemember staff works out of a small suite of offices in a new office building in Northwest Washington filled with furniture and computers donated by corporations Next month the foundation will release the results of a poll on the place and importance of religion in public life Its efforts will culminate June 24 and 25 with a summit in Williamsburg Va to celebrate the religious freedom guaranteed in the First Amendment and to present the charter which they hope will be signed by 50 leaders from all sectors of American life including the President I know the tragedy of Ireland said Mr Guinness a former guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and the Smithsonians Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars who is married to an American It was Mr Guinnesss writings on religious freedom in America that prompted Senator Stevens to ask him if he would like to meet Mr Burger to talk about the state of the First Amendment as the Constitution enters its third century The religious clauses are the most overlooked part of the First Amendment Mr Guinness said Ask most Americans what the First Amendment says and for most the answer would be freedom of speech and they would stop there
CATHOLIC LEADER REBUTS O'CONNOR ON CONDOM ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/30/us/catholic-leader-rebuts-o-connor-on-condom-issue.html,The president of the United States Catholic Conference insisted yesterday that the nations Roman Catholic bishops stood by a policy paper that gave qualified support for teaching about condoms in AIDS education programs The statement by Archbishop John L May of St Louis challenged a report a day earlier from the office of John Cardinal OConnor of New York suggesting that the AIDS policy was in effect being held in abeyance and would be reviewed when all 300 bishops met next June Cardinal OConnor has been a strong opponent of the policy paper which has divided the bishops Position in Disarray The conflicting statements by two influential Catholic leaders left the churchs position on AIDS in disarray The developments were the latest twist in a yearlong effort by the bishops to formulate and promulgate a unified policy on the fatal disease The policy was announced on Dec 10 in a 30page document by the administrative board of the United States Catholic Conference The 50member board has the power to speak for the bishops between the conferences general meetings In the paper the bishops wrote that although Catholics were not permitted to use condoms it was appropriate to teach even in Catholic schools that the use of condoms helps prevent the spread of AIDS Some people will not act as they can and should the bishops reasoned Excerpts From a Letter Conservative bishops led by Cardinal OConnor criticized the paper saying it would confuse Catholics The New York Cardinal said there would be no condom education in his archdiocese Other bishops including Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago praised the policy paper On Monday Cardinal OConnors office made public excerpts from a private letter dated Dec 17 and sent to the bishops by Archbishop May The excerpts were intended to support the Cardinals position The excerpts  and the conclusion that the Cardinals office drew from them  were reported yesterday in The New York Times after Archbishop Mays office declined to provide the full text The article also quoted William Ryan a spokesman for the bishops conference in Washington as saying of the bishops plans It is certainly to review the document but not necessarily to redo the document He added Anything is possible A summary of the text made public yesterday by Archbishop May said that the AIDS policy was still in effect According to the summary the Archbishop said it would be open to reconsideration by the bishops at the meeting in June only if the administrative board agreed to put it on the agenda The policy he said yesterday is neither being withdrawn or temporarily set aside Taking Full Responsibility Cardinal OConnors chief spokesman Msgr Peter G Finn said yesterday that he took full responsibility for a press release Monday that suggested otherwise He said that the Cardinal was not told in advance that the excerpts of Archbishop Mays letter were being made public The decision was mine said Monsignor Finn I regret any confusion Ive caused If as he asserted he acted without the instruction of the Cardinal the step was uncharacteristic for the monsignor an extremely cautious spokesman who rarely takes the initiative in dealing with the press On Monday afternoon however he called The Times to say that he was sending over a press release that would clear up the confusion over the AIDS policy Monsignor Finn said his action had been a mistake In answer to a question Monsignor Finn said that Cardinal OConnor was upset about the press release Criticism by Bernardin The issue of condoms in AIDS education programs is a highly sensitive one for the nations bishops because it conflicts with two key positions of the church opposition to artificial means of birth control and opposition to homosexual practices The release of the excerpts of the letter by Cardinal OConnors office was criticized yesterday by Cardinal Bernardin He said the public disclosure of the partial contents of a private letter has unfortunately led to further confusion about the AIDS policy Cardinal Bernardin was one of four bishops who prepared the AIDS policy Reiterating the statement yesterday by Archbishop May in Washington Cardinal Bernardin said that he wanted to correct two impressions that he said had been left by the release of the excerpts on Monday First he said the statement of the administrative board on AIDS has not been withdrawn or set aside Second he said a final decision on whether the bishops will reopen the issue has not been made and will not be considered until the administrative board meets in March The board will set the agenda for the bishops meeting which will take place June 2427 in Collegeville Minn The dispute has reopened an old rivalry between Cardinal Bernardin and Cardinal OConnor after a period of reconcilliation The two sparred in the 1984 Presidential campaign about the centrality of the abortion issue in Catholic thought At the time Cardinal Bernardin called for a broad attack on a group of issues relating to the sanctity of life among them nuclear arms capital punishment and abortion These issues he said made a seamless garment that deserved the attention of the the American Catholic church Cardinal OConnor however said that there were dangers in equating all of the issues In his actions and speeches he made abortion his primary cause In the 1984 campaign he took the unusual step of attacking the Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine A Ferraro Mrs Ferraro a Catholic had said there was a diversity of Catholic opinion about abortion Cardinal OConnor said that there was only one Catholic opinion it is forbidden
